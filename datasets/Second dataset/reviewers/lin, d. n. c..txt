0912.0964	protoplanetary migration in turbulent isothermal disks	in order to reproduce the statistical properties of the observed exoplanets,population synthesis models have shown that the migration of protoplanetsshould be significantly slowed down, and that processes stalling migrationshould be at work. much current theoretical efforts have thus been dedicated tofind physical effects that slow down, halt or even reverse migration. many ofthese studies rely on the horseshoe drag, whose long term-evolution (saturatedor not) is intimately related to the disk viscosity in laminar disk models. weinvestigate how the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet is altered by amore realistic treatment of the turbulence in protoplanetary disks.two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are performed with a turbulence modelthat reproduces the main turbulence properties of three-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamic calculations. we find that the horseshoe drag can remainunsaturated on the long term, depending on the turbulence strength. we showthat the desaturation of the horseshoe drag by turbulence can be modeled byvortensity diffusion across the time-averaged planet's horseshoe region. atlow-turbulence, the running-time averaged torque is in good agreement with thetotal torque obtained for an equivalent laminar model, with a similarvortensity's diffusion coefficient. at high-turbulence, differences arise dueto the time-evolution of the averaged density profile with turbulence.

1004.0696	dusty disks around white dwarfs i: origin of debris disks	a significant fraction of the mature fgk stars have cool dusty disks at leastan orders of magnitudes brighter than the solar system's outer zodiacal light.since such dusts must be continually replenished, they are generally assumed tobe the collisional fragments of residual planetesimals analogous to the kuiperbelt objects. at least 10% of solar type stars also bear gas giant planets. thefraction of stars with known gas giants or detectable debris disks (or both)appears to increase with the stellar mass. here, we examine the dynamicalevolution of systems of long-period gas giant planets and residualplanetesimals as their host stars evolve off the main sequence, lose mass, andform planetary nebula around remnant white dwarf cores. the orbits of distantgas giant planets and super-km-size planetesimals expand adiabatically. duringthe most intense agb mass loss phase, sub-meter-size particles migrate towardtheir host stars due to the strong hydrodynamical drag by the intense stellarwind. along their migration paths, gas giant planets capture and sweep upsub-km-size planetesimals onto their mean-motion resonances. theseplanetesimals also acquire modest eccentricities which are determined by themass of the perturbing planets, the rate and speed of stellar mass loss. theswept-up planetesimals undergo disruptive collisions which lead to theproduction of grains with an extended size range. the radiation drag on theseparticles is ineffective against the planets' resonant barrier and they form30-to-150-au-sizes rings which can effective reprocess the stellar irradiationin the form of fir continuum. we identify the recently discovered dust ringaround the white dwarf wd 2226-210 at the center of the helix nebula as aprototype of such disks and suggest such rings may be common.

1006.2584	toward a deterministic model of planetary formation vi: dynamical  interaction and coagulation of multiple rocky embryos and super-earth systems  around solar type stars	radial velocity and transit surveys indicate that solar-type stars bearsuper-earths, with mass and period up to ~ 20 m_e and a few months, are morecommon than those with jupiter-mass gas giants. in many cases, thesesuper-earths are members of multiple-planet systems in which their mutualdynamical interaction has influenced their formation and evolution. in thispaper, we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take intoaccount protoplanetary embryos' interaction with their evolving natal gaseousdisk, as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with eachother. we show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emergeinterior to the ice line, grow, migrate, and congregate into closely-packedconvoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars. after the disk-gasdepletion, they undergo orbit crossing, close scattering, and giant impacts toform multiple rocky earths or super-earths in non-resonant orbits around ~0.1au with moderate eccentricities of ~0.01-0.1. we suggest that mostrefractory super-earths with period in the range of a few days to weeks mayhave formed through this process. these super-earths differ from neptune-likeice giants by their compact sizes and lack of a substantial gaseous envelope.

1007.4722	embryo impacts and gas giant mergers i: dichotomy of jupiter and  saturn's core mass	interior to the gaseous envelopes of saturn, uranus, and neptune, there arehigh-density cores with masses larger than 10 earth masses. according to theconventional sequential accretion hypothesis, such massive cores are needed forthe onset of efficient accretion of their gaseous envelopes. however, jupiter'sgaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those ofsaturn. in order to account for this structural diversity and the super-solarmetallicity in the envelope of jupiter and saturn, we investigate thepossibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumedseveral earth-mass proto-planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretionof their envelope. in general, impinging sub-earth-mass planetesimalsdisintegrate in gas giants' envelopes deposit heavy elements well outside thecores and locally suppress the convection. consequently, their fragmentssediment to promote the growth of cores. through a series of numericalsimulations, we show that it is possible for colliding super-earth-mass embryosto reach the cores of gas giants. direct parabolic collisions also lead to thecoalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores. in these cases, theenergy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughoutthe envelope and the erosion of the cores. this dichotomy contributes to theobserved dispersion in the internal structure and atmospheric compositionbetween jupiter and saturn and other gas giant planets and elsewhere.

1011.0360	binaries migrating in a gaseous disk: where are the galactic center  binaries?	the massive stars in the galactic center inner arcsecond share analogousproperties with the so-called hot jupiters. most of these young stars havehighly eccentric orbits, and were probably not formed in-situ. it has beenproposed that these stars acquired their current orbits from the tidaldisruption of compact massive binaries scattered toward the proximity of thecentral supermassive black hole. assuming a binary star formed in a thingaseous disk beyond 0.1 pc from the central object, we investigate therelevance of disk-satellite interactions to harden the binding energy of thebinary, and to drive its inward migration. a massive, equal-mass binary star isfound to become more tightly wound as it migrates inwards toward the centralblack hole. the migration timescale is very similar to that of a single-starsatellite of the same mass. the binary's hardening is caused by the formationof spiral tails lagging the stars inside the binary's hill radius. we show thatthe hardening timescale is mostly determined by the mass of gas inside thebinary's hill radius, and that it is much shorter than the migration timescale.we discuss some implications of the binary's hardening process. when the moremassive (primary) components of close binaries eject most their mass throughsupernova explosion, their secondary stars may attain a range of eccentricitiesand inclinations. such processes may provide an alternative unified scenariofor the origin of the kinematic properties of the central cluster and s-starsin the galactic center as well as the high velocity stars in the galactic halo.

0709.0338	on the orbital evolution of jupiter mass protoplanet embedded in a  self-gravity disk	we performed a series of hydro-dynamic simulations to investigate the orbitalmigration of a jovian planet embedded in a proto-stellar disk. in order to takeinto account of the effect of the disk's self gravity, we developed and adoptedan \textbf{antares} code which is based on a 2-d godunov scheme to obtain theexact reimann solution for isothermal or polytropic gas, with non-reflectingboundary conditions. our simulations indicate that in the study of the runaway(type iii) migration, it is important to carry out a fully self consistenttreatment of the gravitational interaction between the disk and the embeddedplanet. through a series of convergence tests, we show that adequate numericalresolution, especially within the planet's roche lobe, critically determinesthe outcome of the simulations. we consider a variety of initial conditions andshow that isolated, non eccentric protoplanet planets do not undergo type iiimigration. we attribute the difference between our and previous simulations tothe contribution of a self consistent representation of the disk's selfgravity. nevertheless, type iii migration cannot be completely suppressed andits onset requires finite amplitude perturbations such as that induced byplanet-planet interaction. we determine the radial extent of type iii migrationas a function of the disk's self gravity.

0709.1375	toward a deterministic model of planetary formation iv: effects of  type-i migration	in a further development of a deterministic planet-formation model (ida &amp; lin2004), we consider the effect of type-i migration of protoplanetary embryos dueto their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. during the early embeddedphase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regionsinterior to the ice line, uninhibited type-i migration leads to their efficientself-clearing. but, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals atincreasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channelof heavy element accretion onto their host stars. during the advanced stages ofdisk evolution (a few myr), the gas surface density declines to valuescomparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model and type-imigration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos.over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-i migrationefficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has atotal mass several times that of the earth. with this reservoir, there is anadequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rockyplanets similar to those around the sun. but, the onset of efficient gasaccretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than afew m_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. the formationprobability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajoraxis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by thestrength of type-i migration. we suggest that the observed fraction ofsolar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actualtype-i migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deducedfrom linear theories.

0709.1760	thermal waves in irradiated protoplanetary disks	protoplanetary disks are mainly heated by radiation from the central star.since the incident stellar flux at any radius is sensitive to the diskstructure near that location, an unstable feedback may be present. previousinvestigations show that the disk would be stable to finite-amplitudetemperature perturbations if the vertical height of optical surface iseverywhere directly proportional to the gas scale height and if the interceptedfraction of stellar radiation is determined from the local grazing angle. weshow that these assumptions may not be generally applicable. instead, wecalculate the quasi-static thermal evolution of irradiated disks by directlyintegrating the global optical depths to determine the optical surface and thetotal emitting area-filling factor of surface dust. we show that, in disks withmodest mass accretion rates, thermal waves are spontaneously and continuallyexcited in the outer disk, propagate inward through the planet-forming domains,and dissipated at small radii where viscous dissipation is dominant. this stateis quasi-periodic over several thermal timescales and its pattern does notdepend on the details of the opacity law. the viscous dissipation resultingfrom higher mass accretion stabilizes this instability such that anapproximately steady state is realized throughout the disk. in passiveprotostellar disks, especially transitional disks, these waves inducesignificant episodic changes in seds, on the time scales of years to decades,because the midplane temperatures can vary by a factor of two between theexposed and shadowed regions. the transitory peaks and troughs in the potentialvorticity distribution may also lead to baroclinic instability and exciteturbulence in theplanet-forming regions.

1110.5042	on the migration of jupiter and saturn: constraints from linear models  of secular resonant coupling with the terrestrial planets	we examine how the late divergent migration of jupiter and saturn may haveperturbed the terrestrial planets. we identify six secular resonances betweenthe nu_5 apsidal eigenfrequency of jupiter and saturn and the foureigenfrequencies of the terrestrial planets (g_{1-4}). we derive analytic upperlimits on the eccentricity and orbital migration timescale of jupiter andsaturn when these resonances were encountered to avoid perturbing theeccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values larger than the observedones. if jupiter and saturn migrated with eccentricities comparable to theirpresent day values, smooth migration with exponential timescales characteristicof planetesimal-driven migration (\tau~5-10 myr) would have perturbed theeccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values greatly exceeding theobserved ones. this excitation may be mitigated if the eccentricity of jupiterwas small during the migration epoch, migration was very rapid (e.g. \tau&lt;~ 0.5myr perhaps via planet-planet scattering or instability-driven migration) orthe observed small eccentricity amplitudes of the j=2,3 terrestrial modesresult from low probability cancellation of several large amplitudecontributions. further, results of orbital integrations show that very shortmigration timescales (\tau&lt;0.5 myr), characteristic of instability-drivenmigration, may also perturb the terrestrial planets' eccentricities by amountscomparable to their observed values. we discuss the implications of theseconstraints for the relative timing of terrestrial planet formation, giantplanet migration, and the origin of the so-called late heavy bombardment of themoon 3.9+/-0.1 ga ago. we suggest that the simplest way to satisfy thesedynamical constraints may be for the bulk of any giant planet migration to becomplete in the first 30-100 myr of solar system history.

1111.0012	the supernova triggered formation and enrichment of our solar system	we investigate the enrichment of the pre-solar cloud core with short livedradionuclides (slrs), especially 26al. the homogeneity and the surprisinglysmall spread in the ratio 26al/27al observed in the overwhelming majority ofcalcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (cais) in a vast variety of primitivechondritic meteorites places strong constraints on the formation of the thesolar system. freshly synthesized radioactive 26al has to be included and wellmixed within 20kyr. after discussing various scenarios including x-winds, agbstars and wolf-rayet stars, we come to the conclusion that triggering thecollapse of a cold cloud core by a nearby supernova is the most promisingscenario. we then narrow down the vast parameter space by considering thepre-explosion survivability of such a clump as well as the cross-sectionnecessary for sufficient enrichment. we employ numerical simulations to addressthe mixing of the radioactively enriched sn gas with the pre-existing gas andthe forced collapse within 20kyr. we show that a cold clump of 10msun at adistance of 5pc can be sufficiently enriched in 26al and triggered intocollapse fast enough - within 18kyr after encountering the supernova shock -for a range of different metallicities and progenitor masses, even if theenriched material is assumed to be distributed homogeneously in the entiresupernova bubble. in summary, we envision an environment for the birth place ofthe solar system 4.567gyr ago similar to the situation of the pillars in m16nowadays, where molecular cloud cores adjacent to an hii region will be hit bya supernova explosion in the future. we show that the triggered collapse andformation of the solar system as well as the required enrichment withradioactive 26al are possible in this scenario.

0704.3269	atmospheric dynamics of short-period extra solar gas giant planets i:  dependence of night-side temperature on opacity	more than two dozen short-period jupiter-mass gas giant planets have beendiscovered around nearby solar-type stars in recent years, several of whichundergo transits, making them ideal for the detection and characterization oftheir atmospheres. here we adopt a three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamicalnumerical scheme to simulate atmospheric circulation on close-in gas giantplanets. in contrast to the conventional gcm and shallow water algorithms, thismethod does not assume quasi hydrostatic equilibrium and it approximatesradiation transfer from optically thin to thick regions with flux-limiteddiffusion. in the first paper of this series, we considersynchronously-spinning gas giants. we show that a full three-dimensionaltreatment, coupled with rotationally modified flows and an accurate treatmentof radiation, yields a clear temperature transition at the terminator. based ona series of numerical simulations with varying opacities, we show that thenight-side temperature is a strong indicator of the opacity of the planetaryatmosphere. planetary atmospheres that maintain large, interstellar opacitieswill exhibit large day-night temperature differences, while planets withreduced atmospheric opacities due to extensive grain growth and sedimentationwill exhibit much more uniform temperatures throughout their photosphere's. inaddition to numerical results, we present a four-zone analytic approximation toexplain this dependence.

1205.4014	the importance of disk structure in stalling type i migration	as planets form they tidally interact with their natal disks. though thetidal perturbation induced by earth and super-earth mass planets is generallytoo weak to significantly modify the structure of the disk, the interaction ispotentially strong enough to cause the planets to undergo rapid type imigration. this physical process may provide a source of short-periodsuper-earths, though it may also pose a challenge to the emergence andretention of cores on long-period orbits with sufficient mass to evolve intogas giants. previous numerical simulations have shown that the type i migrationrate sensitively depends upon the circumstellar disk's properties, particularlythe temperature and surface density gradients. here, we derive these structureparameters for 1) a self-consistent viscous-disk model based on a constant\alpha-prescription, 2) an irradiated disk model that takes into accountheating due to the absorption of stellar photons, and 3) a layered-accretiondisk model with variable \alpha-parameter. we show that in the innerviscously-heated regions of typical protostellar disks, the horseshoe andcorotation torques of super-earths can exceed their differential lindbladtorque and cause them to undergo outward migration. however, the temperatureprofile due to passive stellar irradiation causes type i migration to beinwards throughout much of the disk. for disks in which there is outwardsmigration, we show that location and the mass range of the "planet traps"depends on some uncertain assumptions adopted for these disk models. competingphysical effects may lead to dispersion in super-earths' mass-perioddistribution.

1206.5002	stellar wind mass retention in star clusters: implications for  subsequent episodes of star formation	the discovery of multiple evolutionary sequences has challenged the paradigmthat globular clusters (gcs) host simple stellar populations. in addition,spectroscopic studies of gcs show a spread in light-element abundances,suggesting that multiple sequences can be formed from gaseous ejecta processedin evolved cluster stars. if multiple sequences originate from within gcs, thenit should be determined how such stellar systems retain gas, form new starswithin them and subsequently evolve. here we expand upon previous studies andcarry out hydrodynamical simulations that explore a wide range of clustermasses, compactness, metallicities and stellar age combinations in order todetermine the ideal conditions for gas retention. we find that up to 6.4% ofthe mass of the star cluster can be made up of retained stellar wind gas at thetime star formation is triggered. however, we show that multiple episodes ofstar formation can take place during the lifetime of a star cluster inparticular for times $\gtrsim 1$ gyr, thus leading to a sizable enhancement inthe total number of new stars. the fact that this favorable star formation timeinterval coincides with the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase seems to givefurther credence to the idea that, at least in some gcs, there are stars whichhave formed from material processed by a previous generation of stars. theability of extended heating sources, such as pulsar outflows or accretion ontocompact objects, to hamper gas retention is illustrated via a simple numericaltreatment.

1304.0454	on the coagulation and size distribution of pressure confined cores	observations of the pipe nebula have led to the discovery of dense starlesscores. the mass of most cores is too small for their self gravity to hold themtogether. instead, they are thought to be pressure confined. the observed densecores' mass function (cmf) matches well with the initial mass function (imf) ofstars in young clusters. similar cmf's are observed in other star formingregions such as the aquila nebula, albeit with some dispersion. the shape ofthese cmf provides important clues to the competing physical processes whichlead to star formation and its feedback on the interstellar media. in thispaper, we investigate the dynamical origin of the the mass function of starlesscores which are confined by a warm, less dense medium. we consider thecoagulation between the cold cores and their ablation due to kelvin-helmholtzinstability induced by their relative motion through the warm medium. we areable to reproduce the observed cmf among the starless cores in the pipe nebula.our results indicate that in environment similar to the pipe nebula: 1) beforethe onset of their gravitational collapse, the mass distribution of theprogenitor cores is similar to that of the young stars, 2) the observed cmf isa robust consequence of dynamical equilibrium between the coagulation andablation of cores, and 3) a break in the slope of the cmf is due to theenhancement of collisional cross section and suppression of ablation for coreswith masses larger than the cores' bonnor-ebert mass.

0802.1114	toward a deterministic model of planetary formation v. accumulation near  the ice line	we address two outstanding issues in the sequential accretion scenario forgas giant planet formation, the retention of dust grains in the presence of gasdrag and that of cores despite type i migration. the efficiency of theseprocesses is determined by the disk structure. theoretical models suggest thatplanets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral ``deadzone'' near the mid plane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surfacelayers where magnetorotational instability is active. due to a transition inthe abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptlynear the ice line. over a range of modest accretion rates ($\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8} m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), the change in the angular momentumtransfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maximanear the ice line. the azimuthal velocity becomes super-keplerian and thegrains accumulate in this transition zone. this barrier locally retainsprotoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy element surface density to thecritical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. it leads to apreferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. we simulate and reproducethe observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solartype stars without having to greatly reduce the type i migration strength. themass function of the short-period planets can be utilized to calibrate theefficiency of type i migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars withhabitable terrestrial planets.

0802.2359	extent of pollution in planet-bearing stars	(abridged) search for planets around main-sequence (ms) stars more massivethan the sun is hindered by their hot and rapidly spinning atmospheres. thisobstacle has been sidestepped by radial-velocity surveys of those stars ontheir post-ms evolutionary track (g sub-giant and giant stars). preliminaryobservational findings suggest a deficiency of short-period hot jupiters aroundthe observed post ms stars, although the total fraction of them with knownplanets appears to increase with their mass. here we consider the possibilitythat some very close- in gas giants or a population of rocky planets may haveeither undergone orbital decay or been engulfed by the expanding envelope oftheir intermediate-mass host stars. if such events occur during or shortlyafter those stars' main sequence evolution when their convection zone remainsrelatively shallow, their surface metallicity can be significantly enhanced bythe consumption of one or more gas giants. we show that stars with enrichedveneer and lower-metallicity interior follow slightly modified evolution tracksas those with the same high surface and interior metallicity. as an example, weconsider hd149026, a marginal post ms 1.3 msun star. we suggest that itsobserved high (nearly twice solar) metallicity may be confined to the surfacelayer as a consequence of pollution by the accretion of either a planet similarto its known 2.7-day-period saturn-mass planet, which has a 70 mearth compactcore, or a population of smaller mass planets with a comparable total amount ofheavy elements. it is shown that an enhancement in surface metallicity leads toa reduction in effective temperature, in increase in radius and a net decreasein luminosity. the effects of such an enhancement are not negligible in thedeterminations of the planet's radius based on the transit light curves.

1410.1743	the effect of external environment on the evolution of protostellar  disks	using numerical hydrodynamics simulations we studied the gravitationalcollapse of pre-stellar cores of sub-solar mass embedded into a low-densityexternal environment. four models with different magnitude and direction ofrotation of the external environment with respect to the central core werestudied and compared with an isolated model. we found that the infall of matterfrom the external environment can significantly alter the disk properties ascompared to those seen in the isolated model. depending on the magnitude anddirection of rotation of the external environment, a variety of disks can formincluding compact (&lt;= 200 au) ones shrinking in size due to infall of externalmatter with low angular momentum, as well as extended disks forming due toinfall of external matter with high angular momentum. the former are usuallystable against gravitational fragmentation, while the latter are prone tofragmentation and formation of stellar systems with sub-stellar/very-low-masscompanions. in the case of counterrotating external environment, very compact(&lt; 5 au) and short-lived (&lt;= a few * 10^5 yr) disks can form when infallingmaterial has low angular momentum. the most interesting case is found for theinfall of counterrotating external material with high angular momentum, leadingto the formation of counterrotating inner and outer disks separated by a deepgap at a few tens au. the gap migrates inward due to accretion of the innerdisk onto the protostar, turns into a central hole, and finally disappearsgiving way to the outer strongly gravitationally unstable disk. this model maylead to the emergence of a transient stellar system withsub-stellar/very-low-mass components counterrotating with respect to that ofthe star.

1410.6815	embryo impacts and gas giant mergers ii: diversity of hot jupiters'  internal structure	we consider the origin of compact, short-period, jupiter-mass planets. wepropose that their diverse structure is caused by giant impacts of embryos andsuper-earths or mergers with other gas giants during the formation andevolution of these hot jupiters. through a series of numerical simulations, weshow that typical head-on collisions generally lead to total coalescence ofimpinging gas giants. although extremely energetic collisions can disintegratethe envelope of gas giants, these events seldom occur. during oblique andmoderately energetic collisions, the merger products retain higher fraction ofthe colliders' cores than their envelopes. they can also deposit considerableamount of spin angular momentum to the gas giants and desynchronize their spinsfrom their orbital mean motion. we find that the oblateness of gas giants canbe used to infer the impact history. subsequent dissipation of stellar tideinside the planets' envelope can lead to runaway inflation and potentially asubstantial loss of gas through roche-lobe overflow. the impact of super-earthson parabolic orbits can also enlarge gas giant planets' envelope and elevatestheir tidal dissipation rate over $\sim $ 100 myr time scale. since giantimpacts occur stochastically with a range of impactor sizes and energies, theirdiverse outcomes may account for the dispersion in the mass-radius relationshipof hot jupiters.

1509.05047	on the imf in a triggered star formation context	the origin of the stellar initial mass function (imf) is a fundamental issuein the theory of star formation. it is generally fit with a composite powerlaw. some clues on the progenitors can be found in dense starless cores thathave a core mass function (cmf) with a similar shape. in the low-mass end,these mass functions increase with mass, albeit the sample may be somewhatincomplete; in the high-mass end, the mass functions decrease with mass. thereis an offset in the turn-over mass between the two mass distributions. thestellar mass for the imf peak is lower than the corresponding core mass for thecmf peak in the pipe nebula by about a factor of three. smaller offsets arefound between the imf and the cmfs in other nebulae. we suggest that the offsetis likely induced during a starburst episode of global star formation which istriggered by the formation of a few o/b stars in the multi-phase media, whichnaturally emerged through the onset of thermal instability in the cloud-coreformation process. we consider the scenario that the ignition of a few massivestars photoionizes the warm medium between the cores, increases the externalpressure, reduces their bonnor?ebert mass, and triggers the collapse of somepreviously stable cores. we quantitatively reproduce the imf in the low-massend with the assumption of additional rotational fragmentation.

1509.05772	giant impact: an efficient mechanism for the devolatilization of  super-earths	mini-neptunes and volatile-poor super-earths coexist on adjacent orbits inproximity to host stars such as kepler-36 and kepler-11. several post-formationprocesses have been proposed for explaining the origin of the compositionaldiversity: the mass loss via stellar xuv irradiation, degassing of accretedmaterial, and in-situ accumulation of the disk gas. close-in planets are alsolikely to experience giant impacts during the advanced stage of planetformation. this study examines the possibility of transforming volatile-richsuper-earths / mini-neptunes into volatile-depleted super-earths through giantimpacts. we present the results of three-dimensional giant impact simulationsin the accretionary and disruptive regimes. target planets are modeled with athree-layered structure composed of an iron core, silicate mantle andhydrogen/helium envelope. in the disruptive case, the giant impact can removemost of the h/he atmosphere immediately and homogenize the refractory materialin the planetary interior. in the accretionary case, the planet can retain morethan half of the gaseous envelope, while a compositional gradient suppressesefficient heat transfer as its interior undergoes double-diffusive convection.after the giant impact, a hot and inflated planet cools and contracts slowly.the extended atmosphere enhances the mass loss via both a parker wind inducedby thermal pressure and hydrodynamic escape driven by the stellar xuvirradiation. as a result, the entire gaseous envelope is expected to be lostdue to the combination of those processes in both cases. we propose thatkepler-36b may have been significantly devolatilized by giant impacts, while asubstantial fraction of kepler-36c's atmosphere may remain intact. furthermore,the stochastic nature of giant impacts may account for the large dispersion inthe mass--radius relationship of close-in super-earths and mini-neptunes.

0806.1521	assembling the building blocks of giant planets around intermediate mass  stars	we examine a physical process that leads to the efficient formation of gasgiant planets around intermediate mass stars. in the gaseous protoplanetarydisks surrounding rapidly-accreting intermediate-mass stars we show that themidplane temperature (heated primarily by turbulent dissipation) can reach &gt;1000 k out to 1 au. thermal ionization of this hot gas couples the disk to themagnetic field, allowing the magneto-rotational instability (mri) to generateturbulence and transport angular momentum. further from the central star theionization fraction decreases, decoupling the disk from the magnetic field andreducing the efficiency of angular momentum transport. as the disk evolvestowards a quasi-steady state, a local maximum in the surface density and in themidplane pressure both develop at the inner edge of the mri-dead zone, trappinginwardly migrating solid bodies. small particles accumulate and coagulate intoplanetesimals which grow rapidly until they reach isolation mass. in contrastto the situation around solar type stars, we show that the isolation mass forcores at this critical radius around the more massive stars is large enough topromote the accretion of significant amounts of gas prior to disk depletion.through this process, we anticipate a prolific production of gas giants at ~1au around intermediate-mass stars.

0705.3649	on the origin of kinematic distribution of the sub-parsec young stars in  the galactic center	within a half-parsec from the galactic center (gc), there is a population ofcoeval young stars which appear to reside in a coherent disk. surrounding thisdynamically-cool stellar system, there is a population of stars with a similarage and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. wepropose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. withoutspecifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that bothstellar populations were formed within a disk some 6 myr ago. but this orderlystructure was dynamically perturbed outside-in by an intruding object with amass ~10^4 msun, which may be an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) or a darkstellar cluster hosting an imbh. we suggest that the perturber migrated inwardto ~0.15-0.3pc from the gc under the action of dynamical friction. along theway, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean-motionresonance, forced them to migrate with it, closely encountered with them, andinduced the growth of their eccentricity and inclination. but stars in theinner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. we predictthat some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may havesimilar galactocentric semimajor axis. future precision determination of theirkinematic distribution of these stars will not only provide a test for thishypothesis but also evidences for the presence of an imbh or a dark cluster atthe immediate proximity of the massive black hole at the gc.

astro-ph;0002106	thermal instability and the formation of clumpy gas clouds	the radiative cooling of optically thin gaseous regions and the formation ofa two-phase medium and of cold gas clouds with a clumpy substructure isinvestigated. in optically thin clouds, the growth rate of small isobaricdensity perturbations is independent of their length scale. however, the growthof a perturbation is limited by its transition from isobaric to isochoriccooling. the temperature at which this transition occurs decreases with thelength scale of the perturbation. consequently small scale perturbations havethe potential to reach higher amplitudes than large scale perturbations. whenthe amplitude becomes nonlinear, advection overtakes the pressure gradient inpromoting the compression resulting in an accelerated growth of thedisturbance. the critical temperature for transition depends on the initialamplitude. the fluctuations which can first reach nonlinearity before theirisobaric to isochoric transition will determine the characteristic size andmass of the cold dense clumps which would emerge from the cooling of aninitially nearly homogeneous region of gas. thermal conduction is in generalvery efficient in erasing isobaric, small-scale fluctuations, suppressing acooling instability. a weak, tangled magnetic field can however reduce theconductive heat flux enough for low-amplitude fluctuations to grow isobaricallyand become non-linear if their length scales are of order 0.01 pc. finally, wedemonstrate how a 2-phase medium, with cold clumps being pressure confined in adiffuse hot residual background component, would be sustained if there isadequate heating to compensate the energy loss.

astro-ph;0004055	on the two-phase structure of protogalactic clouds	within protogalaxies, thermal instability leads to the formation of apopulation of cool fragments, confined by the pressure of residual hot gas. thehot gas remains in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, at approximately the virialtemperature of the dark matter halo. it is heated by compression and shockdissipation and is cooled by bremsstrahlung emission and conductive losses intothe cool clouds. the cool fragments are photoionized and heated by theextragalactic uv background and nearby massive stars. the smallest clouds areevaporated due to conductive heat transfer from the hot gas. all are subject todisruption due to hydrodynamic instabilities. they also gain mass due tocollisions and mergers and condensation from the hot gas due to conduction. thesize distribution of the fragments in turn determines the rate and efficiencyof star formation during the early phase of galactic evolution. we haveperformed one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the hotand cool gas. the cool clouds are assumed to follow a power-law sizedistribution, and fall into the galactic potential, subject to drag from thehot gas. the relative amounts of the hot and cool gas is determined by theprocesses discussed above, and star formation occurs at a rate sufficient tomaintain the cool clouds at 10$^4$ k. we present density distributions for thetwo phases and also for the stars for several cases, parametrized by thecircular speeds of the potentials. under some conditions, primarily lowdensities of the hot gas, conduction is more efficient than radiative processesat cooling the hot gas, limiting the x-ray radiation from the halo gas.

astro-ph;0205104	eccentricity evolution of extrasolar multiple planetary systems due to  the depletion of nascent protostellar disks	most extrasolar planets are observed to have eccentricities much larger thanthose in the solar system. some of these planets have sibling planets, withcomparable masses, orbiting around the same host stars. in these multipleplanetary systems, eccentricity is modulated by the planets' mutual secularinteraction as a consequence of angular momentum exchange between them. formature planets, the eigenfrequencies of this modulation are determined by theirmass and semi-major axis ratios. but, prior to the disk depletion, self gravityof the planets' nascent disks dominates the precession eigenfrequencies. weexamine here the initial evolution of young planets' eccentricity due to theapsidal libration or circulation induced by both the secular interactionbetween them and the self gravity of their nascent disks. we show that as thelatter effect declines adiabatically with disk depletion, the modulationamplitude of the planets' relative phase of periapse is approximately invariantdespite the time-asymmetrical exchange of angular momentum between planets.however, as the young planets' orbits pass through a state of secularresonance, their mean eccentricities undergo systematic quantitative changes.for applications, we analyze the eccentricity evolution of planets aroundupsilon andromedae and hd168443 during the epoch of protostellar diskdepletion. we find that the disk depletion can change the planets' eccentricityratio. however, the relatively large amplitude of the planets' eccentricitycannot be excited if all the planets had small initial eccentricities.

astro-ph;0208552	radial flow of dust particles in accretion disks	we study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellardisks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. this study takes account of thetwo dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including theeffects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from themidplane. it is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than thegas component. at high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates fasterthan particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its dragforce causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. viscous torqueinduces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward,carrying small (size &lt; 100 micron at 10 au) particles with it. only particlesat intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (&gt; 1 mm at 10 au)move inward. when the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entirevertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. at large distances fromthe central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than thegas accretion velocity. however, their inward velocity is reduced below that ofthe gas in the inner regions of the disk. the rate of velocity decrease is afunction of the particles' size. while larger particles retain fast accretionvelocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles haveslower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r &lt; 100 au). thisdifferential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. dust diskscomposed mostly of small particles (size &lt; 10 micron) accrete slower than gasdisks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretionphase.

astro-ph;0304450	surface outflow in optically thick dust disks by the radiation pressure	we study the outflow of dust particles on the surface layers of opticallythick disks. at the surface of disks around young stars, small dust particles(size &lt; 10 micron) experience stellar radiation pressure support and orbit moreslowly than the surrounding gas. the resulting tail-wind imparts energy andangular momentum to the dust particles, moving them outward. this outflowoccurs in the thin surface layer of the disk that is exposed to starlight, andthe outward mass flux is carried primarily by particles of size ~0.1 micron.beneath the irradiated surface layer, dust particles experience a head-wind,which drives them inward. for the specific case of a minimum-mass-solar-nebula,less than a thousandth of the dust mass experiences outward flow. if thestellar luminosity is 15 times brighter than the sun, however, or if the gasdisk mass is as small as ~100 m_earth, then the surface outflow can dominatethe inward flux in certain radial ranges, leading to the formation of rings orgaps in the dust disks.

astro-ph;0310218	tidal dissipation in rotating giant planets	[abridged] tides may play an important role in determining the observeddistributions of mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of the extrasolarplanets. in addition, tidal interactions between giant planets in the solarsystem and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migrationof the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. wetreat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining theefficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets. in cases of interest,the tidal forcing frequencies are comparable to the spin frequency of theplanet but small compared to its dynamical frequency. we therefore study thelinearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet tolow-frequency tidal forcing. convective regions of the planet support inertialwaves, while any radiative regions support generalized hough waves. we presentillustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate and arguethat inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation inmost cases of interest. the resulting value of q depends in a highly erraticway on the forcing frequency, but we provide evidence that the relevantfrequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of theviscosity in the limit of small ekman number. in short-period extrasolarplanets, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of aradiative outer layer that supports generalized hough modes, the tidaldissipation rate can be enhanced through the excitation and damping of thesewaves. these dissipative mechanisms offer a promising explanation of thehistorical evolution and current state of the galilean satellites as well asthe observed circularization of the orbits of short-period extrasolar planets.

astro-ph;0312144	towards a deterministic model of planetary formation i: a desert in the  mass and semi major axis distributions of extra solar planets	we examine the accretion of cores of giant planets from planetesimals, gasaccretion onto the cores, and their orbital migration. we adopt a working modelfor nascent protostellar disks with a wide variety of surface densitydistributions in order to explore the range of diversity among extra solarplanetary systems. if some cores can acquire more mass than a critical value ofseveral earth masses during the persistence of the disk gas, they would be ableto rapidly accrete gas and evolve into gas giant planets. the gas accretionprocess is initially regulated by the kelvin-helmholtz contraction of theplanets' gas envelope. based on the assumption that the exponential decay ofthe disk-gas mass occurs on the time scales $\sim 10^{6}-10^{7}$ years and thatthe disk mass distribution is comparable to those inferred from theobservations of circumstellar disks of t tauri stars, we carry out simulationsto predict the distributions of masses and semi major axes of extra solarplanets. since planets' masses grow rapidly from $10 m_{\oplus}$ to $100m_{\oplus}$, the gas giant planets rarely form with asymptotic masses in thisintermediate range. our model predicts a paucity of extra solar planets withmass in the range 10-$100 m_{\oplus}$ and semi major axis less than 3au. werefer to this deficit as a ``planet desert''. the effect of migration is tosharpen the boundaries and to enhance the contrast of the planet desert. themass and semi major axis distributions generated in our simulations for the gasgiants are consistent with those of the known extra solar planets.

astro-ph;0408019	the formation and retention of gas giant planets around stars with a  range of metallicities	the apparent dependence of detection frequency of extrasolar planets on themetallicity of their host stars is investigated with monte carlo simulationsusing a deterministic core-accretion planet formation model. according to thismodel, gas giants formed and acquired their mass $m_{\rm p}$ throughplanetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas isaccreted. these protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semi-majoraxis $a$ through their tidal interaction with their nascent disk. based on theobserved properties of protostellar disks, we generate $m_{\rm p}$-$a$distribution. our results reproduce the observed lack of planets withintermediate mass $m_{\rm p} = 10$--100$m_{\oplus}$ and $a \la 3$au and withlarge mass $m_{\rm p} \ga 10^3 m_{\oplus}$ and $a \la 0.2$au. based on thesimulated $m_{\rm p}$-$a$ distributions, we also evaluate the metallicitydependence of fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable withcurrent radial velocity survey. if protostellar disks attain the same fractionof heavy elements which are contained in their host stars, the detectionprobability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced becauseprotoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several earth masses prior totheir depletion. these large masses are required for the cores to initiaterapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. the theoreticallyextrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observation. thiscorrelation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario.we also suggest other metallicity dependence of the planet distributions thatcan be tested by on-going observations.

astro-ph;0408191	spin-orbit evolution of short-period planets	the negligible eccentricity of all extra solar planets with periods less thansix days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within theirenvelopes which are induced by their host stars. in the period range of 7-21days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits.these will be referred to as the borderline planets. we propose that thisdiscrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of youngstars. in particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidaldisturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star canexcite eccentricity growth, and for a more slowly spinning star, at leastreduce the eccentricity damping rate. in contrast, tidal dissipation within theenvelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricitydamping process. based on these results, we suggest that short-period planetsaround relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricitythan those around mature stars. we also suggest that because the rate ofangular momentum loss from g and k dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster thanthe tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very-short(3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration inwhich the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel andsynchronous with the orbital frequency. in principle, however, suchconfigurations may be established for planets (around g and k dwarfs) withorbital periods of up to several weeks. in contrast to g and k dwarfs, theangular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in f dwarfs. it istherefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around suchstars. the planet around tau boo is one such example.

astro-ph;0410095	attenuation of millimeter emission from circumstellar disks induced by  the rapid dust accretion	from millimeter observations of classical t tauri stars, it is suggested thatdust grains in circumstellar disks have grown to millimeter size or larger.however, gas drag on such large grains induces rapid accretion of the dust. weexamine the evolution of dust disks composed of millimeter sized grains, andshow that rapid accretion of the dust disk causes attenuation of millimetercontinuum emission. if a dust disk is composed mainly of grains of 1 cm to 1 m,its millimeter emission goes off within 10^6 yr. hence, grains in this sizerange cannot be a main population of the dust. considering our results togetherwith grain growth suggested by the millimeter continuum observations, we expectthat the millimeter continuum emission of disks comes mainly from grains in anarrow size range of [1 mm -1 cm]. this suggests either that growth ofmillimeter sized grains to centimeter size takes more than 10^6 yr, or thatmillimeter sized grains are continuously replenished. in the former case,planet formation is probably difficult, especially in the outer disks. in thelatter case, reservoirs of millimeter grains are possibly large (&gt; 10 m)bodies, which can reside in the disk more than 10^6 yr. constraints on thegrain growth time-scale are discussed for the above two cases.

astro-ph;0503466	the differential lifetimes of protostellar gas and dust disks	we construct a protostellar disk model that takes into account the combinedeffect of viscous evolution, photoevaporation and the differential radialmotion of dust grains and gas. for t tauri disks, the lifetimes of dust disksthat are mainly composed of millimeter sized grains are always shorter than thegas disks' lifetimes, and become similar only when the grains are fluffy(density &lt; 0.1 g cm^{-3}). if grain growth during the classical t tauri phaseproduces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete ontothe star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas diskand the star evolves to the weak line t tauri phase. in the weak line phase,only dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (&gt; 10 au), without strong signsof gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. for herbigaebe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,before the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. in thiscase, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inneredge (at 10-100 au from the star). the dust grains remain there even after theentire gas disk has been photoevaporated, and form a gas-poor dust ring similarto that observed around hr 4796a. hence, depending on the strength of thestellar ionizing flux, our model predicts opposite types of products aroundyoung stars. for low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gasdisks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a highphotoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form. this prediction shouldbe examined by observations of gas and dust around weak line t tauri stars andevolved herbig aebe stars.

astro-ph;0611557	the influence of mass-loss from a star cluster on its dynamical friction  -- i. clusters without internal evolution	many local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies are found in the galactic haloalong great circles in the sky. some of these stellar systems are thought to bethe fragments of larger parent galaxies which have once intruded into and weretorn apart by the tide of the galaxy. supporting evidences for tidal disruptionare found in the form of stellar tidal bridges and tails along the orbits ofsome dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. in this study, we investigate theinfluence of mass-loss from star clusters or dwarf galaxies on the rate oftheir orbit decay due to the effect of dynamical friction. using a series ofnumerical n-body simulations, we show that stars, which become unbound fromtheir host-systems, but remain in their vicinity and share their orbits, stillcontribute to the mass responsible for the dynamical friction. as arule-by-thumb, the magnitude of dynamical friction at any instance can beapproximated by the bound mass plus half of the mass which has already becomeunbound during the proceeding galactic orbit. based on these results, wesuggest the tidal disruption of relatively massive satellite stellar systemsmay be more abrupt than previously estimated.

astro-ph;0612757	dynamics of planetary systems in star clusters	at least 10-15% of nearby sun-like stars have known jupiter-mass planets. incontrast, very few planets are found in mature open and globular clusters suchas the hyades and 47 tuc. we explore here the possibility that this dichotomyis due to the post-formation disruption of planetary systems associated withthe stellar encounters in long-lived clusters. one supporting piece of evidencefor this scenario is the discovery of freely floating low-mass objects in starforming regions. we use two independent numerical approaches, a hybrid montecarlo and a direct $n$-body method, to simulate the impact of the encounters.we show that the results of numerical simulations are in reasonable agreementwith analytical determinations in the adiabatic and impulsive limits. theyindicate that distant stellar encounters generally do not significantly modifythe compact and nearly circular orbits. however, moderately close stellarencounters, which are likely to occur in dense clusters, can excite planets'orbital eccentricity and induce dynamical instability in systems which areclosely packed with multiple planets. we compute effective cross sections forthe dissolution of planetary systems and show that, for all initialeccentricities, dissolution occurs on time scales which are longer than thedispersion of small stellar associations, but shorter than the age of typicalopen and globular clusters. although it is much more difficult to disruptshort-period planets, close encounters can excite modest eccentricity amongthem, such that subsequent tidal dissipation leads to orbital decay, tidalinflation, and even disruption of the close-in planets.

astro-ph;0701269	tidal barrier and the asymptotic mass of proto gas-giant planets	extrasolar planets found with radial velocity surveys have masses rangingfrom several earth to several jupiter masses. while mass accretion ontoprotoplanetary cores in weak-line t-tauri disks may eventually be quenched by aglobal depletion of gas, such a mechanism is unlikely to have stalled thegrowth of some known planetary systems which contain relatively low-mass andclose-in planets along with more massive and longer period companions. here, wesuggest a potential solution for this conundrum. in general, supersonic infallof surrounding gas onto a protoplanet is only possible interior to both of itsbondi and roche radii. at a critical mass, a protoplanet's bondi and rocheradii are equal to the disk thickness. above this mass, the protoplanets' tidalperturbation induces the formation of a gap. although the disk gas may continueto diffuse into the gap, the azimuthal flux across the protoplanets' roche lobeis quenched. using two different schemes, we present the results of numericalsimulations and analysis to show that the accretion rate increases rapidly withthe ratio of the protoplanet's roche to bondi radii or equivalently to the diskthickness. in regions with low geometric aspect ratios, gas accretion isquenched with relatively low protoplanetary masses. this effect is importantfor determining the gas-giant planets' mass function, the distribution of theirmasses within multiple planet systems around solar type stars, and forsuppressing the emergence of gas-giants around low mass stars.

astro-ph;0702492	tidal dissipation in rotating solar-type stars	we calculate the excitation and dissipation of low-frequency tidaloscillations in uniformly rotating solar-type stars. for tidal frequenciessmaller than twice the spin frequency, inertial waves are excited in theconvective envelope and are dissipated by turbulent viscosity. enhanceddissipation occurs over the entire frequency range rather than in a series ofvery narrow resonant peaks, and is relatively insensitive to the effectiveviscosity. hough waves are excited at the base of the convective zone andpropagate into the radiative interior. we calculate the associated dissipationrate under the assumption that they do not reflect coherently from the centerof the star. tidal dissipation in a model based on the present sun issignificantly enhanced through the inclusion of the coriolis force but maystill fall short of that required to explain the circularization of closebinary stars. however, the dependence of the results on the spin frequency,tidal frequency, and stellar model indicate that a more detailed evolutionarystudy including inertial and hough waves is required. we also discuss the caseof higher tidal frequencies appropriate to stars with very close planetarycompanions. the survival of even the closest hot jupiters can be plausiblyexplained provided that the hough waves they generate are not damped at thecenter of the star. we argue that this is the case because the tide excited bya hot jupiter in the present sun would marginally fail to achieve nonlinearity.as conditions at the center of the star evolve, nonlinearity may set in at acritical age, resulting in a relatively rapid inspiral of the hot jupiter.

astro-ph;9312015	using fu orionis outbursts to constrain self-regulated protostellar disk  models	one dimensional, convective, vertical structure models and one dimensional,time dependent, radial diffusion models are combined to create aself-consistent picture in which fu~orionis outbursts occur in young stellarobjects (ysos) as the result of a large scale, self-regulated, thermalionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. byfitting the results of time dependent disk models to observed time scales offu~orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effeciency of the effectiveviscous stress in the inner disk (r &lt; 1 au) to be, in accordance with the adhoc ``alpha'' prescription, 10^{-4} where hydrogen is neutral and 10^{-3} wherehydrogen is ionized. we hypothesize that all ysos receive infall onto theirouter disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that fu~orionisoutbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems whichtransport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to beionized in the inner disk. we estimate a critical mass flux of 5x10^{-7} solarmasses / year {\it independent of the magnitude of alpha} for systems with onesolar mass, three solar radius central objects. infall accretion rates in therange of (1-10)x10^{-6} solar masses per year produce observed fu~orionis timescales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapserates.

astro-ph;9709055	evidence for an intervening stellar population toward the large  magellanic cloud	we identify a vertical extension of the red clump stars in the colormagnitude diagram (cmd) of a section of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). aftersubtracting the principal red clump component, we find a peak in the residualstellar distribution that is ~ 0.9 mag brighter than the peak of the principalred clump distribution. we consider and reject the following possibleexplanations for this population: inhomogeneous reddening, galactic disk stars,random blends of red clump stars, correlated blends of red clump stars(binaries), evolution of the red clump stars, and red clump stars from ayounger lmc stellar population. combinations of these effects cannot be ruledout as the origin of this stellar population. a natural interpretation of thisnew population is that it consists of red clump stars that are closer to usthan those in the lmc. we find corroborating evidence for this interpretationin holtzman et al.'s (1997) hubble space telescope cmd of the lmc field stars.the derived distance and projected angular surface density of these starsrelative to the lmc stars (&lt;~ 5 to 7%) are consistent with (1) models thatattribute the observed microlensing lensing optical depth (alcock et al. 1997)to a distinct foreground stellar population (zhao 1997) and (2) tidal models ofthe interaction between the lmc and the milky way (lin, jones, &amp; klemola 1995).we conclude that the standard assumption of a smoothly distributed halopopulation out to the lmc cannot be substantiated without at least a detailedunderstanding of red clump stellar evolution, binary fractions, binary massratios, the spatial correlation of stars within the lmc, possible variations inthe stellar populations of satellite galaxies, and differential reddening - allof which are highly complex.

astro-ph;9711213	oscillations in solar-type stars tidally induced by orbiting planets	we examine the effect of dynamical tides raised by a companion on asolar-type star. in these binaries, gravity or g mode oscillations are excitedby the companion in the radiative region beneath the convective envelope of thestar. they become evanescent in the convection zone. this is of particularinterest in connection with the newly discovered planets, some of which arefound to orbit around solar-type stars with a period comparable to that of thehigh order g modes of the star. one such example is 51 pegasi. here, wedetermine the magnitude of the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at thestellar surface. we show that, in the case of 51 pegasi, this velocity is toosmall to be observed. this result is insensitive to the magnitude of thestellar turbulent viscosity assumed and is not affected by the possibility ofresonance, which occurs when the frequency of the tidal disturbance is close tothat of some normal mode of the star. we also discuss the orbital evolution andsynchronization timescales associated with the tidal interaction.

astro-ph;9801280	on the tidal interaction of a solar-type star with an orbiting  companion: excitation of g mode oscillation and orbital evolution	we calculate the dynamical tides raised on a non-rotating solar-type star bya close stellar or planetary companion. dissipation arising from a turbulentviscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in theradiative core are considered. we compute the torque exerted on the star by acompanion in circular orbit, and determine the potentially observable magnitudeof the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. these calculationsare compared with the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequencylimit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide).for a standard solar model, the latter is found to give a relatively poorapproximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the systemis far from resonance with a normal mode. it is shown that although thecompanion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under theaction of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration iscontrolled essentially by the non-resonant interaction. we find that theturbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularizationrates of main sequence solar-type binaries is about fifty times larger thanthat simply estimated from mixing length theory for non-rotating stars. wediscuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. thesecalculations are applied to 51 pegasi. we show that the perturbed velocityinduced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed.

astro-ph;9902098	constraints on intervening stellar populations toward the large  magellanic cloud	the suggestion by zaritsky &amp; lin that a vertical extension of the red clumpfeature in color-magnitude diagrams of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) isconsistent with a significant population of foreground stars to the lmc thatcould account for the observed microlensing optical depth has been challengedby various investigators. we respond by (1) examining each of the challengespresented and (2) presenting new photometric and spectroscopic data. weconclude that although the cmd data do not mandate the existence of aforeground population, they are entirely consistent with a foregroundpopulation associated with the lmc that contributes significantly (~ 50%) tothe observed microlensing optical depth. from our new data, we conclude that &lt;~40% of the vrc stars are young, massive red clump stars because (1) syntheticcolor-magnitude diagrams created using the star formation history derivedindepdently from hst data suggest that &lt; 50% of the vrc stars are young,massive red clump stars, (2) the angular distribution of the vrc stars is moreuniform than that of the young (age &lt; 1 gyr) main sequence stars, and (3) thevelocity dispersion of the vrc stars in the region of the lmc examined by zl isinconsistent with the expectation for a young disk population. each of thesearguments is predicated on assumptions and the conclusions are uncertain.therefore, an exact determination of the contribution to the microlensingoptical depth by the various hypothesized foreground populations, and thesubsequent conclusions regarding the existence of halo machos, requires adetailed knowledge of many complex astrophysical issues, such as the imf, starformation history, and post-main sequence stellar evolution.

0812.0586	type i planet migration in nearly laminar disks	we describe 2d hydrodynamic simulations of the migration of low-mass planets($\leq 30 m_{\oplus}$) in nearly laminar disks (viscosity parameter $\alpha &lt;10^{-3}$) over timescales of several thousand orbit periods. we consider diskmasses of 1, 2, and 5 times the minimum mass solar nebula, disk thicknessparameters of $h/r = 0.035$ and 0.05, and a variety of $\alpha$ values andplanet masses. disk self-gravity is fully included. previous analytic work hassuggested that type i planet migration can be halted in disks of sufficientlylow turbulent viscosity, for $\alpha \sim 10^{-4}$. the halting is due to afeedback effect of breaking density waves that results in a slight massredistribution and consequently an increased outward torque contribution. thesimulations confirm the existence of a critical mass ($m_{cr} \sim 10m_{\oplus}$) beyond which migration halts in nearly laminar disks. for $\alpha\ga 10^{-3}$, density feedback effects are washed out and type i migrationpersists. the critical masses are in good agreement with the analytic model ofrafikov (2002). in addition, for $\alpha \la 10^{-4}$ steep density gradientsproduce a vortex instability, resulting in a small time-varying eccentricity inthe planet's orbit and a slight outward migration. migration in nearly laminardisks may be sufficiently slow to reconcile the timescales of migration theorywith those of giant planet formation in the core accretion model.

0706.1272	grain retention and formation of planetesimals near the snow line in  mri-driven turbulent protoplanetary disks	the first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and thecores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. in mostregions of these disks, gas attains sub-keplerian speeds as a consequence of anegative pressure gradient. hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay anddepletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales asshort as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 au. in thispaper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes theaccumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the watersublimation front or ``snow line.'' this model is based on the assumption that,in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution ofthe disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability(mri) in the surface layers of the disk. the depth to which mri effectivelygenerates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. asharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reducesthe column depth of the active layer. as the disk evolves towards aquasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum inradial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas torotate at super-keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.this senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in theformation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.
