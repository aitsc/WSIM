0903.0871	more on crinkles in the last scattering surface	inhomogeneous recombination can give rise to perturbations in the electronnumber density which can be a factor of five larger than the perturbations inbaryon density. we do a thorough analysis of the second order anisotropiesgenerated in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) due to perturbations in theelectron number density. we show that solving the second order boltzmannequation for photons is equivalent to solving the first + second orderboltzmann equations and then taking the second order part of the solution. wefind the approximate solution to the photon boltzmann hierarchy in l modes andshow that the contributions from inhomogeneous recombination to the secondorder monopole, dipole and quadrupole are numerically small. we also point outthat perturbing the electron number density in the first order tight couplingand damping solutions for the monopole, dipole and quadrupole is not equivalentto solving the second order boltzmann equations for inhomogeneousrecombination. finally we confirm our result in a previous paper thatinhomogeneous recombination gives rise to a local type non-gaussianityparameter f_{nl}~ -1. the signal to noise for the detection of the temperaturebispectrum generated by inhomogeneous recombination is ~ 1 for an ideal fullsky experiment measuring modes up to l_{max}=2500.

0903.2532	parameters and pitfalls in dark energy models with time varying equation  of state	are geometrical summaries of the cmb and lss sufficient for estimatingcosmological parameters? and how does our choice of a dark energy model impactthe current constraints on standard cosmological parameters?  we address these questions in the context of the widely used cplparametrization of a time varying equation of state w in a cosmology allowingspatial curvature. we study examples of different behavior allowed in a cplparametrization in a phase diagram, and relate these to effects on theobservables. we examine parameter constraints in such a cosmology by combiningwmap5, sdss, sne, hst data sets by comparing the power spectra. we carefullyquantify the differences of these constraints to those obtained by usinggeometrical summaries for the same data sets.  we find that (a) using summary parameters instead of the full data sets giveparameter constraints that are similar, but with discernible differences, (b)due to degeneracies, the constraints on the standard parameters broadensignificantly for the same data sets. in particular, we find that in thecontext of cpl dark energy, (i) a harrison-zeldovich spectrum cannot be ruledout at $2\sigma$ levels with our current data sets. and (ii) the sne ia, hst,and wmap 5 data are not sufficient to constrain spatial curvature; weadditionally require the sdss dr4 data to achieve this.

0906.3978	cosmic cartography of the large-scale structure with sloan digital sky  survey data release 6	we present the largest wiener reconstruction of the cosmic density field madeto date. the reconstruction is based on the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 6 covering the northern galactic cap. we use a novel supersamplingalgorithm to suppress aliasing effects and a krylov-space inversion method toenable high performance with high resolution. these techniques are implementedin the argo computer code. we reconstruct the field over a 500 mpc cube withmpc grid-resolution while accounting both for the angular and radial selectionfunctions of the sdss, and the shot noise giving an effective resolution of theorder of ~10 mpc. in addition, we correct for the redshift distortions in thelinear and nonlinear regimes in an approximate way. we show that the commonlyused method of inverse weighting the galaxies by the corresponding selectionfunction heads to excess noise in regions where the density of the observedgalaxies is small. it is more accurate and conservative to adopt a bayesianframework in which we model the galaxy selection/detection process to bepoisson-binomial. this results in heavier smoothing in regions of reducedsampling density. our results show a complex cosmic web structure with hugevoid regions indicating that the recovered matter distribution is highlynon-gaussian. filamentary structures are clearly visible on scales up to ~20mpc. we also calculate the statistical distribution of density after smoothingthe reconstruction with gaussian kernels of different radii r_s and find goodagreement with a log-normal distribution for ~10 mpc &lt; r_s &lt; ~30 mpc.

0910.2710	21 cm radiation: a new probe of fundamental physics	new low frequency radio telescopes currently being built open up thepossibility of observing the 21-cm radiation before the epoch of reionizationin the future, in particular at redshifts 200 &gt; z &gt; 30, also known as the darkages. at these high redshifts, cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation isabsorbed by neutral hydrogen at its 21-cm hyperfine transition. this redshifted21-cm signal thus carries information about the state of the early universe andcan be used to test fundamental physics. we study the constraints theseobservations can put on the variation of fundamental constants. we show thatthe 21-cm radiation is very sensitive to the variations in the fine structureconstant and can in principle place constraints comparable to or better thanthe other astrophysical experiments (fractional change &lt; 10^ {-5}). making suchobservations will require radio telescopes of collecting area 10 - 10^6 sq. kmcompared to 1 sq. km of current telescopes. these observations will thusprovide independent constraints on the fine structure constant at highredshifts, observations of quasars being the only alternative. more importantlythe 21-cm absorption of cmb is the only way to probe the redshift range betweenrecombination and reionization.

1002.0014	voids as a precision probe of dark energy	a signature of the dark energy equation of state may be observed in the shapeof voids. we estimate the constraints on cosmological parameters that would bedetermined from the ellipticity distribution of voids from future spectroscopicsurveys already planned for the study of large scale structure.  the constraints stem from the sensitivity of the distribution of ellipticityto the cosmological parameters through the variance of fluctuations of thedensity field smoothed at some length scale. this length scale can be chosen tobe of the order of the comoving radii of voids at very early times when thefluctuations are gaussian distributed. we use fisher estimates to show that theconstraints from void ellipticities are promising. combining these constraintswith other traditional methods results in the improvement of the dark energytask force figure of merit on the dark energy parameters by an order of hundredfor future experiments. the estimates of these future constraints depend on anumber of systematic issues which require further study using simulations. weoutline these issues and study the impact of certain observational andtheoretical systematics on the forecasted constraints on dark energyparameters.

1002.1713	probing local non-gaussianities within a bayesian framework	aims: we outline the bayesian approach to inferring f_nl, the level ofnon-gaussianity of local type. phrasing f_nl inference in a bayesian frameworktakes advantage of existing techniques to account for instrumental effects andforeground contamination in cmb data and takes into account uncertainties inthe cosmological parameters in an unambiguous way.  methods: we derive closed form expressions for the joint posterior of f_nland the reconstructed underlying curvature perturbation, phi, and deduce theconditional probability densities for f_nl and phi. completing the inferenceproblem amounts to finding the marginal density for f_nl. for realistic datasets the necessary integrations are intractable. we propose an exacthamiltonian sampling algorithm to generate correlated samples from the f_nlposterior. for sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, we can exploit theassumption of weak non-gaussianity to find a direct monte carlo technique togenerate independent samples from the posterior distribution for f_nl. weillustrate our approach using a simplified toy model of cmb data for the simplecase of a 1-d sky.  results: when applied to our toy problem, we find that, in the limit of highsignal-to-noise, the sampling efficiency of the approximate algorithmoutperforms that of hamiltonian sampling by two orders of magnitude. when f_nlis not significantly constrained by the data, the more efficient, approximatealgorithm biases the posterior density towards f_nl = 0.

1005.5568	the primordial non-gaussianity of local type (f_nl) in the wmap 5-year  data: the length distribution of cmb skeleton	we present skeleton studies of non-gaussianity in the cmb temperatureanisotropy observed in the wmap5 data. the local skeleton is traced on the 2dsphere by cubic spline interpolation which leads to more accurate estimation ofthe intersection positions between the skeleton and the secondary pixels thanconventional linear interpolation. we demonstrate that the skeleton-basedestimator of non-gaussianity of the local type (f_nl) - the departure of thelength distribution from the corresponding gaussian expectation - yields anunbiased and sufficiently converged f_nl-likelihood.  we analyse the skeleton statistics in the wmap5 combined v- and w-band dataoutside the galactic base-mask determined from the kq75 sky-coverage. theresults are consistent with gaussian simulations of the the best-fittingcosmological model, but deviate from the previous results determined using thewmap1 data. we show that it is unlikely that the improved skeleton tracingmethod, the omission of q-band data, the modification of theforeground-template fitting method or the absence of 6 extended regions in thenew mask contribute to such a deviation. however, the application of the kp0base-mask in data processing does improve the consistency with the wmap1results.  the f_nl-likelihoods of the data are estimated at 9 different smoothinglevels. it is unexpected that the best-fit values show positive correlationwith the smoothing scales. further investigation argues against a point-sourceor goodness-of-fit explanation but finds that about 30% of either gaussian orf_nl samples having better goodness-of-fit than the wmap5 show a similarcorrelation. we present the estimate f_nl=47.3+/-34.9 (1sigma error) determinedfrom the first four smoothing angles and f_nl=76.8+/-43.1 for the combinationof all nine. the former result may be overestimated at the 0.21sigma-levelbecause of point sources.

1010.1254	local non-gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background the bayesian  way	we introduce an exact bayesian approach to search for non-gaussianity oflocal type in cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation data. using simulatedcmb temperature maps, the newly developed technique is compared against theconventional frequentist bispectrum estimator. starting from the jointprobability distribution, we obtain analytic expressions for the conditionalprobabilities of the primordial perturbations given the data, and for the levelof non-gaussianity, f_nl, given the data and the perturbations. we proposehamiltonian monte carlo sampling as a means to derive realizations of theprimordial fluctuations from which we in turn sample f_nl. although beingcomputationally expensive, this approach allows us to exactly construct thefull target posterior probability distribution. when compared to thefrequentist estimator, applying the bayesian method to gaussian cmb mapsprovides consistent results. for the analysis of non-gaussian maps, however,the error bars on f_nl do not show excess variance within the bayesianframework. this finding is of particular relevance in the light of upcominghigh precision cmb measurements obtained by the planck satellite mission.

1104.0672	arkcos: artifact-suppressed accelerated radial kernel convolution on the  sphere	we describe a hybrid fourier/direct space convolution algorithm for compactradial (azimuthally symmetric) kernels on the sphere. for high resolution mapscovering a large fraction of the sky, our implementation takes advantage of theinexpensive massive parallelism afforded by consumer graphics processing units(gpus). applications involve modeling of instrumental beam shapes in terms ofcompact kernels, computation of fine-scale wavelet transformations, and optimalfiltering for the detection of point sources. our algorithm works for anypixelization where pixels are grouped into isolatitude rings. even for kernelsthat are not bandwidth limited, ringing features are completely absent on anecp grid. we demonstrate that they can be highly suppressed on the popularhealpix pixelization, for which we develop a freely available implementation ofthe algorithm. as an example application, we show that running on a high-endconsumer graphics card our method speeds up beam convolution for simulations ofa characteristic planck high frequency instrument channel by two orders ofmagnitude compared to the commonly used healpix implementation on one cpu corewhile maintaining at typical a fractional rms accuracy of about 1 part in 10^5.

1104.0930	the probability distribution for non-gaussianity estimators	one of the principle efforts in cosmic microwave background (cmb) research ismeasurement of the parameter fnl that quantifies the departure from gaussianityin a large class of non-minimal inflationary (and other) models. estimators forfnl are composed of a sum of products of the temperatures in three differentpixels in the cmb map. since the number ~npix^2 of terms in this sum exceedsthe number npix of measurements, these ~npix^2 terms cannot be statisticallyindependent. therefore, the central-limit theorem does not necessarily apply,and the probability distribution function (pdf) for the fnl estimator does notnecessarily approach a gaussian distribution for n_pix &gt;&gt; 1. although thevariance of the estimators is known, the significance of a measurement of fnldepends on knowledge of the full shape of its pdf. here we use monte carlorealizations of cmb maps to determine the pdf for two minimum-varianceestimators: the standard estimator, constructed under the null hypothesis(fnl=0), and an improved estimator with a smaller variance for |fnl| &gt; 0. whilethe pdf for the null-hypothesis estimator is very nearly gaussian when the truevalue of fnl is zero, the pdf becomes significantly non-gaussian when |fnl| &gt;0. in this case we find that the pdf for the null-hypothesis estimator fnl_hatis skewed, with a long non-gaussian tail at fnl_hat &gt; |fnl| and lessprobability at fnl_hat &lt; |fnl| than in the gaussian case. we provide ananalytic fit to these pdfs. on the other hand, we find that the pdf for theimproved estimator is nearly gaussian for observationally allowed values offnl. we discuss briefly the implications for trispectrum (and otherhigher-order correlation) estimators.

1106.2757	bayesian inference from photometric redshift surveys	we show how to enhance the redshift accuracy of surveys consisting of tracerswith highly uncertain positions along the line of sight. photometric surveyswith redshift uncertainty delta_z ~ 0.03 can yield final redshift uncertaintiesof delta_z_f ~ 0.003 in high density regions. this increased redshift precisionis achieved by imposing an isotropy and 2-point correlation prior in a bayesiananalysis and is completely independent of the process that estimates thephotometric redshift. as a byproduct, the method also infers the threedimensional density field, essentially super-resolving high density regions inredshift space. our method fully takes into account the survey mask andselection function. it uses a simplified poissonian picture of galaxyformation, relating preferred locations of galaxies to regions of higherdensity in the matter field. the method quantifies the remaining uncertaintiesin the three dimensional density field and the true radial locations ofgalaxies by generating samples that are constrained by the survey data. theexploration of this high dimensional, non-gaussian joint posterior is madefeasible using multiple-block metropolis-hastings sampling. we demonstrate theperformance of our implementation on a simulation containing 2.0 x 10^7galaxies. these results bear out the promise of bayesian analysis for upcomingphotometric large scale structure surveys with tens of millions of galaxies.

1306.1821	methods for bayesian power spectrum inference with galaxy surveys	we derive and implement a full bayesian large scale structure inferencemethod aiming at precision recovery of the cosmological power spectrum fromgalaxy redshift surveys. our approach improves over previous bayesian methodsby performing a joint inference of the three dimensional density field, thecosmological power spectrum, luminosity dependent galaxy biases andcorresponding normalizations. we account for all joint and correlateduncertainties between all inferred quantities. classes of galaxies withdifferent biases are treated as separate sub samples. the method therefore alsoallows the combined analysis of more than one galaxy survey.  in particular, it solves the problem of inferring the power spectrum fromgalaxy surveys with non-trivial survey geometries by exploring the jointposterior distribution with efficient implementations of multiple block markovchain and hybrid monte carlo methods. our markov sampler achieves highstatistical efficiency in low signal to noise regimes by using a deterministicreversible jump algorithm. we test our method on an artificial mock galaxysurvey, emulating characteristic features of the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 7, such as its survey geometry and luminosity dependent biases. thesetests demonstrate the numerical feasibility of our large scale bayesianinference frame work when the parameter space has millions of dimensions.  the method reveals and correctly treats the anti-correlation between biasamplitudes and power spectrum, which are not taken into account in currentapproaches to power spectrum estimation, a 20 percent effect across largeranges in k-space. in addition, the method results in constrained realizationsof density fields obtained without assuming the power spectrum or biasparameters in advance.

1309.1469	probabilistic image reconstruction for radio interferometers	we present a novel, general-purpose method for deconvolving and denoisingimages from gridded radio interferometric visibilities using bayesian inferencebased on a gaussian process model. the method automatically takes into accountincomplete coverage of the uv-plane, signal mode coupling due to the primarybeam, and noise mode coupling due to uv sampling. our method uses gibbssampling to efficiently explore the full posterior distribution of theunderlying signal image given the data. we use a set of widely diverse mockimages with a realistic interferometer setup and level of noise to assess themethod. compared to results from a proxy for point source- based clean methodwe find that in terms of rms error and signal-to-noise ratio our approachperforms better than traditional deconvolution techniques, regardless of thestructure of the source image in our test suite. our implementation scales aso(np log np), provides full statistical and uncertainty information of thereconstructed image, requires no supervision, and provides a robust, consistentframework for incorporating noise and parameter marginalizations and foregroundremoval.

1309.5087	sparse sampling, galaxy bias, and voids	to study the impact of sparsity and galaxy bias on void statistics, we use asingle large-volume, high-resolution n-body simulation to compare voids inmultiple levels of subsampled dark matter, halo populations, and mock galaxiesfrom a halo occupation distribution model tuned to different galaxy surveydensities. we focus our comparison on three key observational statistics:number functions, ellipticity distributions, and radial density profiles. weuse the hierarchical tree structure of voids to interpret the impacts ofsampling density and galaxy bias, and theoretical and empirical functions todescribe the statistics in all our sample populations. we are able to makesimple adjustments to theoretical expectations to offer prescriptions fortranslating from analytics to the void properties measured in realisticobservations. we find that sampling density has a much larger effect on voidsizes than galaxy bias. at lower tracer density, small voids disappear and theremaining voids are larger, more spherical, and have slightly steeper profiles.when a proper lower mass threshold is chosen, voids in halo distributionslargely mimic those found in galaxy populations, except for ellipticities,where galaxy bias leads to higher values. we use the void density profile ofhamaus et al. (2014) to show that voids follow a self-similar and universaltrend, allowing simple translations between voids studied in dark matter andvoids identified in galaxy surveys. we have added the mock void catalogs usedin this work to the public cosmic void catalog at http://www.cosmicvoids.net.

1311.3301	the dark matter of galaxy voids	how do observed voids relate to the underlying dark matter distribution? toexamine the spatial distribution of dark matter contained within voidsidentified in galaxy surveys, we apply halo occupation distribution modelsrepresenting sparsely and densely sampled galaxy surveys to a high-resolutionn-body simulation. we compare these galaxy voids to voids found in the halodistribution, low-resolution dark matter, and high-resolution dark matter. wefind that voids at all scales in densely sampled surveys - and medium- tolarge-scale voids in sparse surveys - trace the same underdensities as darkmatter, but they are larger in radius by ~20%, they have somewhat shallowerdensity profiles, and they have centers offset by ~0.4rv rms. however, invoid-to-void comparison we find that shape estimators are less robust tosampling, and the largest voids in sparsely sampled surveys sufferfragmentation at their edges. we find that voids in galaxy surveys alwayscorrespond to underdensities in the dark matter, though the centers may beoffset. when this offset is taken into account, we recover almost identicalradial density profiles between galaxies and dark matter. all mock catalogsused in this work are available at http://www.cosmicvoids.net.

1403.5499	universal density profile for cosmic voids	we present a simple empirical function for the average density profile ofcosmic voids, identified via the watershed technique in $\lambda$cdm n-bodysimulations. this function is universal across void size and redshift,accurately describing a large radial range of scales around void centers withonly two free parameters. in analogy to halo density profiles, these parametersdescribe the scale radius and the central density of voids. while we initiallystart with a more general four-parameter model, we find two of its parametersto be redundant, as they follow linear trends with the scale radius in twodistinct regimes of the void sample, separated by its compensation scale.assuming linear theory, we derive an analytic formula for the velocity profileof voids and find an excellent agreement with the numerical data as well. inour companion paper [sutter et al., mon. not. r. astron. soc. 442, 462 (2014)]the presented density profile is shown to be universal even across tracer type,properly describing voids defined in halo and galaxy distributions of varyingsparsity, allowing us to relate various void populations by simple rescalings.this provides a powerful framework to match theory and simulations withobservational data, opening up promising perspectives to constrain competingmodels of cosmology and gravity.

1404.5618	a measurement of the alcock-paczynski effect using cosmic voids in the  sdss	we perform an alcock-paczynski test using stacked cosmic voids identified inthe sdss data release 7 main sample and data release 10 lowz and cmass samples.we find ~1,500 voids out to redshift $0.6$ using a heavily modified andextended version of the watershed algorithm zobov, which we call vide (voididentification and examination). to assess the impact of peculiar velocities weuse the mock void catalogs presented in sutter et al. (2013). we find aconstant uniform flattening of 14% along the line of sight when peculiarvelocities are included. this flattening appears universal for all void sizesat all redshifts and for all tracer densities. we also use these mocks toidentify an optimal stacking strategy. after correcting for systematic effectswe find that our alcock-paczynski measurement leads to a preference of ourbest-fit value of $\omega_{\rm m}\sim 0.15$ over $\omega_{\rm m} = 1.0$ by alikelihood ratio of 10. likewise, we find a factor of $4.5$ preference of thelikelihood ratio for a $\lambda$cdm $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.3$ model and a nullmeasurement. taken together, we find substantial evidence for thealcock-paczynski signal in our sample of cosmic voids. our assessment usingrealistic mocks suggests that measurements with future sdss releases and othersurveys will provide tighter cosmological parameter constraints. thevoid-finding algorithm and catalogs used in this work will be made publiclyavailable at http://www.cosmicvoids.net.

1409.6308	past and present cosmic structure in the sdss dr7 main sample	we present a chrono-cosmography project, aiming at the inference of the fourdimensional formation history of the observed large scale structure from itsorigin to the present epoch. to do so, we perform a full-scale bayesiananalysis of the northern galactic cap of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)data release 7 main galaxy sample, relying on a fully probabilistic, physicalmodel of the non-linearly evolved density field. besides inferring initialconditions from observations, our methodology naturally and accuratelyreconstructs non-linear features at the present epoch, such as walls andfilaments, corresponding to high-order correlation functions generated bylate-time structure formation. our inference framework self-consistentlyaccounts for typical observational systematic and statistical uncertaintiessuch as noise, survey geometry and selection effects. we further account forluminosity dependent galaxy biases and automatic noise calibration within afully bayesian approach. as a result, this analysis provides highly-detailedand accurate reconstructions of the present density field on scales larger than$\sim~3$ mpc$/h$, constrained by sdss observations. this approach also leads tothe first quantitative inference of plausible formation histories of thedynamic large scale structure underlying the observed galaxy distribution. theresults described in this work constitute the first full bayesian non-linearanalysis of the cosmic large scale structure with the demonstrated capabilityof uncertainty quantification. some of these results will be made publiclyavailable along with this work. the level of detail of inferred results and thehigh degree of control on observational uncertainties pave the path towardshigh precision chrono-cosmography, the subject of simultaneously studying thedynamics and the morphology of the inhomogeneous universe.

1412.3461	an optimal estimator for resonance bispectra in the cmb	we propose an (optimal) estimator for a cmb bispectrum containinglogarithmically spaced oscillations. there is tremendous theoretical interestin such bispectra, and they are predicted by a plethora of models, includingaxion monodromy models of inflation and initial state modifications. the numberof resolved logarithmical oscillations in the bispectrum is limited due to thediscrete resolution of the multipole bispectrum. we derive a simple relationbetween the maximum number of resolved oscillations and the frequency. weinvestigate several ways to factorize the primordial bispectrum, and concludethat a one dimensional expansion in the sum of the momenta $\sum k_i = k_t$ isthe most efficient and flexible approach. we compare the expansion to the exactresult in multipole space and show for $\omega_{\rm eff}=100$ that$\mathcal{o}(10^3)$ modes are sufficient for an accurate reconstruction. wecompute the expected $\sigma_{f_{\rm nl}}$ and find that within an effectivefield theory (eft) the overall signal to noise scales as $s/n\propto\omega^{3/2}$. using only the temperature data we find$s/n\sim\mathcal{o}(1-10^2)$ for the frequency domain set by the eft.

1502.07751	scola: the n-body cola method extended to the spatial domain	we present scola -- an extension of the n-body comoving lagrangianacceleration (cola) method to the spatial domain. similar to the originaltemporal-domain cola, scola is an n-body method for solving for large-scalestructure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectoriescalculated in lagrangian perturbation theory. incorporating the scola method inan n-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing thegravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, whileletting the n-body code solve only for the near field. the far and near fieldsare completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the n-body side ofthe code. thus, running an n-body code for a small simulation volume usingscola can reproduce the results of a standard n-body run for the same smallvolume embedded inside a much larger simulation. we demonstrate that scola canbe safely combined with the original temporal-domain cola. scola can be used asa method for performing zoom-in simulations. it also allows n-body codes to bemade embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume ofinterest using grid computing. moreover, scola can be useful for cheaplygenerating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to studygalaxy clustering. surveys that will benefit the most are ones with largeaspect ratios, such as pencil-beam surveys, where scola can easily capture theeffects of large-scale transverse modes without the need to substantiallyincrease the simulated volume. as an illustration of the method, we presentproof-of-concept zoom-in simulations using a freely available scola-basedn-body code.

1507.04363	probing cosmology and gravity with redshift-space distortions around  voids	cosmic voids in the large-scale structure of the universe affect the peculiarmotions of objects in their vicinity. although these motions are difficult toobserve directly, the clustering pattern of their surrounding tracers inredshift space is influenced in a unique way. this allows to investigate theinterplay between densities and velocities around voids, which is solelydictated by the laws of gravity. with the help of $n$-body simulations andderived mock-galaxy catalogs we calculate the average density fluctuationsaround voids identified with a watershed algorithm in redshift space andcompare the results with the expectation from general relativity and the$\lambda$cdm model. we find linear theory to work remarkably well in describingthe dynamics of voids. adopting a bayesian inference framework, we explore thefull posterior of our model parameters and forecast the achievable accuracy onmeasurements of the growth rate of structure and the geometric distortionthrough the alcock-paczynski effect. systematic errors in the latter arereduced from $\sim15\%$ to $\sim5\%$ when peculiar velocities are taken intoaccount. the relative parameter uncertainties in galaxy surveys with numberdensities comparable to the sdss main (cmass) sample probing a volume of$1h^{-3}{\rm gpc}^3$ yield $\sigma_{f/b}\left/(f/b)\right.\sim2\%$ ($20\%$) and$\sigma_{d_ah}/d_ah\sim0.2\%$ ($2\%$), respectively. at this level of precisionthe linear-theory model becomes systematics dominated, with parameter biasesthat fall beyond these values. nevertheless, the presented method is highlymodel independent; its viability lies in the underlying assumption ofstatistical isotropy of the universe.

astro-ph;0401623	magic: exact bayesian covariance estimation and signal reconstruction  for gaussian random fields	in this talk i describe magic, an efficient approach to covariance estimationand signal reconstruction for gaussian random fields (magic allows globalinference of covariance). it solves a long-standing problem in the field ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) data analysis but is in fact a generaltechnique that can be applied to noisy, contaminated and incomplete or censoredmeasurements of either spatial or temporal gaussian random fields. in this talki will phrase the method in a way that emphasizes its general structure andapplicability but i comment on applications in the cmb context. the methodallows the exploration of the full non-gaussian joint posterior density of thesignal and parameters in the covariance matrix (such as the power spectrum)given the data. it generalizes the familiar wiener filter in that itautomatically discovers signal correlations in the data as long as a noisemodel is specified and priors encode what is known about potentialcontaminants. the key methodological difference is that instead of attemptingto evaluate the likelihood (or posterior density) or its derivatives, thismethod generates an asymptotically exact monte carlo sample from it. i presentexample applications to power spectrum estimation and signal reconstructionfrom measurements of the cmb. for these applications the method achievesspeed-ups of many orders of magnitude compared to likelihood maximizationtechniques, while offering greater flexibility in modeling and a fullcharacterization of the uncertainty in the estimates.

astro-ph;0404037	the hot and cold spots in the wmap data are not hot and cold enough	this paper presents a frequentist analysis of the hot and cold spots of thecosmic microwave background data collected by the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap). we compare the wmap temperature statistics of extrema(number of extrema, mean excursion, variance, skewness and kurtosis of theexcursion) to monte-carlo simulations. we find that, on average, the localmaxima (high temperatures in the anisotropy) are too cold and the local minimaare too warm. in order to quantify this claim we describe a two-sidedstatistical hypothesis test which we advocate for other investigations of thegaussianity hypothesis. using this test we reject the isotropic gaussianhypothesis at more than 99% confidence in a well-defined way. our claims arebased only on regions that are outside the most conservative wmap foregroundmask. we perform our test separately on maxima and minima, and on the north andsouth ecliptic and galactic hemispheres and reject gaussianity at above 95%confidence for almost all tests of the mean excursions. the same test alsoshows the variance of the maxima and minima to be low in the ecliptic north(99% confidence), but consistent in the south; this effect is not as pronouncedin the galactic north and south hemispheres.

astro-ph;0407196	interacting quintessence, cosmic acceleration and the coincidence  problem	faced by recent evidence for a flat universe dominated by dark energy,cosmologists grapple with deep cosmic enigmas such as the cosmological constantproblem, extreme fine-tuning and the cosmic coincidence problem. the extent towhich we observe the dimming of distant supernovae suggests that the cosmicacceleration is as least as severe as in cosmological constant models.extrapolating this to our cosmic future implies terrifying visions of either acold and empty universe or an explosive demise in a ``big rip.'' we construct aclass of dynamical scalar field models of dark energy and dark matter. withinthis class we can explain why supernovae imply a cosmic equation of state$w\lesssim-1$, address fine tuning issues, protect the universe from prematureacceleration and predict a constant fraction of dark energy to dark matter inthe future (thus solving the coincidence problem), satisfy the dominant energycondition, and ensure that gravitationally bound objects remain so forever(avoid a big rip). this is achieved with a string theory inspired lagrangiancontaining standard kinetic terms, exponential potentials and couplings, andparameters of order unity.

astro-ph;0606709	pico: parameters for the impatient cosmologist	we present a fast, accurate, robust and flexible method of acceleratingparameter estimation. this algorithm, called pico, can compute the cmb powerspectrum and matter transfer function as well as any computationally expensivelikelihoods in a few milliseconds. by removing these bottlenecks from parameterestimation codes, pico decreases their computational time by 1 or 2 orders ofmagnitude. pico has several important properties. first, it is extremely fastand accurate over a large volume of parameter space. furthermore, its accuracycan continue to be improved by using a larger training set. this method isgeneralizable to an arbitrary number of cosmological parameters and to anyrange of l-values in multipole space. pico is approximately 3000 times fasterthan camb for flat models, and approximately 2000 times faster then the wmap 3year likelihood code. in this paper, we demonstrate that using pico to computepower spectra and likelihoods produces parameter posteriors that are verysimilar to those using camb and the official wmap3 code, but in only a fractionof the time. pico and an interface to cosmomc are made publicly available athttp://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~bwandelt/pico/.

astro-ph;0701921	fast estimator of primordial non-gaussianity from temperature and  polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background	measurements of primordial non-gaussianity ($f_{nl}$) open a new window ontothe physics of inflation. we describe a fast cubic (bispectrum) estimator of$f_{nl}$, using a combined analysis of temperature and polarizationobservations. the speed of our estimator allows us to use a sufficient numberof monte carlo simulations to characterize its statistical properties in thepresence of real world issues such as instrumental effects, partial skycoverage, and foreground contamination. we find that our estimator is optimal,where optimality is defined by saturation of the cramer rao bound, if noise ishomogeneous. our estimator is also computationally efficient, scaling as$o(n^{3/2})$ compared to the $o(n^{5/2})$ scaling of the brute force bispectrumcalculation for sky maps with $n$ pixels. for planck this translates into aspeed-up by factors of millions, reducing the required computing time fromthousands of years to just hours and thus making $f_{nl}$ estimation feasiblefor future surveys. our estimator in its current form is optimal if noise ishomogeneous. in future work our fast polarized bispectrum estimator should beextended to deal with inhomogeneous noise in an analogous way to how theexisting fast temperature estimator was generalized.

astro-ph;9801267	primordial non-gaussianity: baryon bias and gravitational collapse of  cosmic string wakes	i compute the 3-d non-linear evolution of gas and dark matter fluids in theneighbourhood of cosmic string wakes which are formed at high redshift($z\simeq 2240$) for a ``realistic'' scenario of wake formation. these wakesare the ones which stand out most prominently as cosmological sheets and areexpected to play a dominant r\^ole in the cosmic string model of structureformation. employing a high-resolution 3-d hydrodynamics code to evolve thesewakes until the present day yields results for the baryon bias generated in theinner wake region. i find that today, wakes would be $1.5 h^{-1}$ mpc thick andcontain a 70% excess in the density of baryons over the dark matter density intheir centre. however, high density peaks in the wake region do not inherit abaryon enhancement. i propose a mechanism for this erasure of the baryon excessin spherically collapsed objects based on the geometry change around thecollapsing region. further, i present heuristic arguments for the consequencesof this work for large scale structure in the cosmic string model and concludethat the peculiarities of wake formation are unlikely to have significantimport on the discrepancy between power spectrum predictions and observationsin this model. if one invokes the nucleosynthesis bound on $\omega_b$ thiscould be seen as strengthening the case against $\omega_m=1$ or for low hubbleconstants.
