0908.0945	results of the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	we present the results of the great08 challenge, a blind analysis challengeto infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. the primarygoal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchersoutside the shear measurement community. six great08 team methods werepresented at the launch of the challenge and five additional groups submittedresults during the 6 month competition. participants analyzed 30 millionsimulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread functionellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. the large quantity of simulationsallowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracysuitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the firsttime. different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameterspace and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. anumber of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the challenge including are-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. the imagesimulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future great challenges,meanwhile the great08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additionaldevelopments in shear measurement algorithms.

0909.0529	optimal capture of non-gaussianity in weak lensing surveys: power  spectrum, bispectrum and halo counts	we compare the efficiency of weak lensing-selected galaxy clusters counts andof the weak lensing bispectrum at capturing non-gaussian features in the darkmatter distribution. we use the halo model to compute the weak lensing powerspectrum, the bispectrum and the expected number of detected clusters, andderive constraints on cosmological parameters for a large, low systematic weaklensing survey, by focusing on the $\omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane and on the darkenergy equation of state. we separate the power spectrum into the resolved andthe unresolved parts of the data, the resolved part being defined as detectedclusters, and the unresolved part as the rest of the field. we consider fourkinds of clusters counts, taking into account different amount of information :signal-to-noise ratio peak counts; counts as a function of clusters' mass;counts as a function of clusters' redshift; and counts as a function ofclusters' mass and redshift. we show that when combined with the powerspectrum, those four kinds of counts provide similar constraints, thus allowingone to perform the most direct counts, signal-to-noise peaks counts, and getpercent level constraints on cosmological parameters. we show that the weaklensing bispectrum gives constraints comparable to those given by the powerspectrum and captures non-gaussian features as well as clusters counts, itscombination with the power spectrum giving errors on cosmological parametersthat are similar to, if not marginally smaller than, those obtained whencombining the power spectrum with cluster counts. we finally note that in orderto reach its potential, the weak lensing bispectrum must be computed using alltriangle configurations, as equilateral triangles alone do not provide usefulinformation.

0707.2249	a subaru weak lensing survey i: cluster candidates and spectroscopic  verification	we present the results of an ongoing weak lensing survey conducted with thesubaru telescope whose initial goal is to locate and study the distribution ofshear-selected structures or halos. using a suprime-cam imaging survey spanning21.82 square degree, we present a catalog of 100 candidate halos located fromlensing convergence maps. our sample is reliably drawn from that subset of oursurvey area, (totaling 16.72 square degree) uncontaminated by bright stars andedge effects and limited at a convergence signal to noise ratio of 3.69. tovalidate the sample detailed spectroscopic measures have been made for 26candidates using the subaru multi-object spectrograph, focas. all are confirmedas clusters of galaxies but two arise as the superposition of multiple clustersviewed along the line of sight. including data available in the literature andan ongoing keck spectroscopic campaign, a total of 41 halos now have reliableredshifts. for one of our survey fields, the xmm lss (pierre et al. 2004)field, we compare our lensing-selected halo catalog with its x-ray equivalent.of 15 halos detected in the xmm-lss field, 10 match with published x-rayselected clusters and a further 2 are newly-detected and spectroscopicallyconfirmed in this work. although three halos have not yet been confirmed, thehigh success rate within the xmm-lss field (12/15) confirms that weak lensingprovides a reliable method for constructing cluster catalogs, irrespective ofthe nature of the constituent galaxies or the intracluster medium.

0710.5171	systematic bias in cosmic shear: beyond the fisher matrix	we describe a method for computing the biases that systematic signalsintroduce in parameter estimation using a simple extension of the fisher matrixformalism. this allows us to calculate the offset of the best fit parametersrelative to the fiducial model, in addition to the usual statistical errorellipse. as an application, we study the impact that residual systematics intomographic weak lensing measurements. in particular we explore three differenttypes of shape measurement systematics: (i) additive systematic with noredshift evolution; (ii) additive systematic with redshift evolution; and (iii)multiplicative systematic. in each case, we consider a wide range of scaledependence and redshift evolution of the systematics signal. for a futuredune-like full sky survey, we find that, for cases with mild redshiftevolution, the variance of the additive systematic signal should be kept below10^-7 to ensure biases on cosmological parameters that are sub-dominant to thestatistical errors. for the multiplicative systematics, which depends on thelensing signal, we find the multiplicative calibration m0 needs to becontrolled to an accuracy better than 10^-3. we find that the impact ofsystematics can be underestimated if their assumes redshift dependence is toosimplistic. we provide simple scaling relations to extend these requirements toany survey geometry and discuss the impact of our results for current andfuture weak lensing surveys.

1203.5049	measurement and calibration of noise bias in weak lensing galaxy shape  estimation	weak gravitational lensing has the potential to constrain cosmologicalparameters to high precision. however, as shown by the shear testing programmes(step) and gravitational lensing accuracy testing (great) challenges, measuringgalaxy shears is a nontrivial task: various methods introduce differentsystematic biases which have to be accounted for. we investigate how pixelnoise on the image affects the bias on shear estimates from amaximum-likelihood forward model-fitting approach using a sum of co-ellipticals\'{e}rsic profiles, in complement to the theoretical approach of an anassociated paper. we evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxymodel and find that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of order 1-10%on measured shears, which is significant for current and future lensingsurveys. we evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a biasmodel as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. this modelis then used to correct the simulated measurements. we demonstrate that thismethod can effectively reduce noise bias so that shear measurement reaches thelevel of accuracy required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensingsurveys.

1203.5050	noise bias in weak lensing shape measurements	weak lensing experiments are a powerful probe of cosmology through theirmeasurement of the mass distribution of the universe. a challenge for thistechnique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapesof distant galaxies. in this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematicerror that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurementprocess. we first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general maximumlikelihood estimators (mles) in the presence of additive noise. we then findanalytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modeledand fitted with a gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. even forthis very simple case we find a significant effect. we also extend our analysisto a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical gaussian model. we find that thenoise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noiseratio (snr) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxiesof snr of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. this is nearlytwo orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for futureall-sky weak lensing surveys. we discuss possible ways to circumvent thiseffect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in anassociated paper.

1212.1721	cosmohammer: cosmological parameter estimation with the mcmc hammer	we study the benefits and limits of parallelised markov chain monte carlo(mcmc) sampling in cosmology. mcmc methods are widely used for the estimationof cosmological parameters from a given set of observations and are typicallybased on the metropolis-hastings algorithm. some of the required calculationscan however be computationally intensive, meaning that a single long chain cantake several hours or days to calculate. in practice, this can be limiting,since the mcmc process needs to be performed many times to test the impact ofpossible systematics and to understand the robustness of the measurements beingmade. to achieve greater speed through parallelisation, mcmc algorithms need tohave short auto-correlation times and minimal overheads caused by tuning andburn-in. the resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the mcmcoverheads and the parallelisation costs. in order to efficiently distribute themcmc sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure,we developed a python framework called cosmohammer which embeds emcee, animplementation by foreman-mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemblesampler by goodman and weare (2010). we test the performance of cosmohammer forcosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. whilemetropolis-hastings is dominated by overheads, cosmohammer is able toaccelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 hours on a dual corenotebook to 16 minutes by scaling out to 2048 cores. such short wall times forcomplex data sets opens possibilities for extensive model testing and controlof systematics.

1303.4739	a way forward for cosmic shear: monte-carlo control loops	weak lensing by large scale structure or 'cosmic shear' is a potentiallypowerful cosmological probe to shed new light on dark matter, dark energy andmodified gravity. it is based on the weak distortions induced by large-scalestructures on the observed shapes of distant galaxies through gravitationallensing. while the potentials of this purely gravitational effect are great,results from this technique have been hampered because the measurement of thisweak effect is difficult and limited by systematics effects. in particular, ademanding step is the measurement of the weak lensing shear from wide field ccdimages of galaxies. we describe the origin of the problem and propose a wayforward for cosmic shear. our proposed approach is based on monte-carlo controlloops and draws upon methods widely used in particle physics and engineering.we describe the control loop scheme and show how it provides a calibrationmethod based on fast image simulations tuned to reproduce the statisticalproperties of a specific cosmic shear data set. through a series of iterativeloops and diagnostic tests, the monte carlo image simulations are made robustto perturbations on modeling input parameters and thus to systematic effects.we discuss how this approach can make the problem tractable and unleash to fullpotential of cosmic shear for cosmology.

0802.1214	handbook for the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	the gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2008 (great08) challenge focuseson a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations incosmology. the shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine theproperties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from thosegalaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. the observedgalaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes mustbe precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution andnoise. the worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significantprogress in techniques to measure these distortions via the shear testingprogram (step). via step, we have run challenges within our own community, andcome to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideallymatched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computationallearning. thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we areseeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. this document detailsthe great08 challenge for potential participants. please visithttp://www.great08challenge.info for the latest information.

1401.3162	a simple model linking galaxy and dark matter evolution	we construct a simple phenomenological model for the evolving galaxypopulation by incorporating pre-defined baryonic prescriptions into a darkmatter hierarchical merger tree. specifically the model is based on the simplegas-regulator model introduced by lilly et al. 2013 coupled with the empiricalquenching rules of peng et al. 2010/12. the simplest model already does quitewell in reproducing, without re-adjusting the input parameters, manyobservables including the main sequence ssfr-mass relation, the faint end slopeof the galaxy mass function and the shape of the star-forming and passive massfunctions. compared with observations and/or the recent phenomenological modelof behroozi et al. 2013 based on epoch-dependent abundance-matching, our modelalso qualitatively reproduces the evolution of the main sequence ssfr(z) andsfrd(z) star formation rate density relations, the $m_s - m_h$ stellar-to-halomass relation and also the $sfr - m_h$ relation. quantitatively the evolutionof ssfr(z) and sfrd(z) is not steep enough, the $m_s - m_h$ relation is notquite peaked enough and, surprisingly, the ratio of quenched to star-forminggalaxies around m* is not quite high enough. we show that these deficienciescan simultaneously be solved by ad hoc allowing galaxies to re-ingest some ofthe gas previously expelled in winds, provided that this is done in amass-dependent and epoch-dependent way. these allow the model galaxies toreduce an inherent tendency to saturate their star-formation efficiency. thisemphasizes how efficient galaxies around m* are in converting baryons intostars and highlights the fact that quenching occurs just at the point whengalaxies are rapidly approaching the maximum possible efficiency of convertingbaryons into stars.

1402.3593	information gains from cosmic microwave background experiments	to shed light on the fundamental problems posed by dark energy and darkmatter, a large number of experiments have been performed and combined toconstrain cosmological models. we propose a novel way of quantifying theinformation gained by updates on the parameter constraints from a series ofexperiments which can either complement earlier measurements or replace them.for this purpose, we use the kullback-leibler divergence or relative entropyfrom information theory to measure differences in the posterior distributionsin model parameter space from a pair of experiments. we apply this formalism toa historical series of cosmic microwave background experiments ranging fromboomerang to wmap, spt, and planck. considering different combinations of theseexperiments, we thus estimate the information gain in units of bits anddistinguish contributions from the reduction of statistical errors and the`surprise' corresponding to a significant shift of the parameters' centralvalues. for this experiment series, we find individual relative entropy gainsranging from about 1 to 30 bits. in some cases, e.g. when comparing wmap andplanck results, we find that the gains are dominated by the surprise ratherthan by improvements in statistical precision. we discuss how this techniqueprovides a useful tool for both quantifying the constraining power of data fromcosmological probes and detecting the tensions between experiments.

1405.3660	3-dimensional spherical analyses of cosmological spectroscopic surveys	spectroscopic redshift surveys offer great prospects for constraining thedark sector in cosmology. future surveys will however be both deep and wide andwill thus require an analysis in 3-dimensional spherical geometry. we reviewand compare several methods which have been proposed in the literature for thispurpose, focusing in particular on implementations of the spherical harmonictomography (sht) power spectrum $c^{i j}_{l}$ and the spherical fourier bessel(sfb) power spectrum $c_{l} (k, k')$. using a fisher analysis, we compare theforecasted constraints on cosmological parameters using these statistics. theseconstraints typically rely on approximations such as the limber approximationand make specific choices in the numerical implementation of each statistic.using a series of toy models, we explore the applicability of theseapproximations and study the sensitivity of the sht and sfb statistics to thedetails of their implementation. in particular, we show that overlappingredshift bins may improve cosmological constraints using the sht statistic whenthe number of bins is small, and that the sfb constraints are quite robust tochanges in the assumed distance-redshift relation. we also find that the shtcan be tailored to be more sensitive to modes at redshifts close to the surveyboundary, while the sfb appears better suited to capture information beyond thesmooth shape of the power spectrum. in this context, we discuss the pros andcons of the different techniques and their impact on the design and analysis offuture wide field spectroscopic surveys.

1410.4345	hope: a python just-in-time compiler for astrophysical computations	the python programming language is becoming increasingly popular forscientific applications due to its simplicity, versatility, and the broad rangeof its libraries. a drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its lowruntime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations andfor the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics andcosmology. while various frameworks have been developed to address thislimitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either forcethe user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of anoptimised native compiled language. in order to combine the ease of python andthe speed of c++, we developed hope, a specialised python just-in-time (jit)compiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. hope focuses on asubset of the language and is able to translate python code into c++ whileperforming numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. toenable the jit compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to thefunction definition. we assess the performance of hope by performing a seriesof benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain python, c++and the other existing frameworks. we find that hope improves the performancecompared to plain python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable tothat of c++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. we discussthe differences between hope and the other frameworks, as well as futureextensions of its capabilities. the fully documented hope package is availableat http://hope.phys.ethz.ch and is published under the gplv3 license on pypiand github.

1504.02778	calibrated ultra fast image simulations for the dark energy survey	weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful technique to probe thedark components of the universe. to understand the measurement process of weaklensing and the associated systematic effects, image simulations are becomingincreasingly important. for this purpose we present a first implementation ofthe $\textit{monte carlo control loops}$ ($\textit{mccl}$; refregier &amp; amara2014), a coherent framework for studying systematic effects in weak lensing. itallows us to model and calibrate the shear measurement process using imagesimulations from the ultra fast image generator (ufig; berge et al. 2013). weapply this framework to a subset of the data taken during the scienceverification period (sv) of the dark energy survey (des). we calibrate the ufigsimulations to be statistically consistent with des images. we then performtolerance analyses by perturbing the simulation parameters and study theirimpact on the shear measurement at the one-point level. this allows us todetermine the relative importance of different input parameters to thesimulations. for spatially constant systematic errors and six simulationparameters, the calibration of the simulation reaches the weak lensingprecision needed for the des sv survey area. furthermore, we find a sensitivityof the shear measurement to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, and aninterplay between the magnitude-size and the pixel value diagnostics inconstraining the noise model. this work is the first application of the$\textit{mccl}$ framework to data and shows how it can be used to methodicallystudy the impact of systematics on the cosmic shear measurement.

1504.07245	approximate bayesian computation for forward modeling in cosmology	bayesian inference is often used in cosmology and astrophysics to deriveconstraints on model parameters from observations. this approach relies on theability to compute the likelihood of the data given a choice of modelparameters. in many practical situations, the likelihood function may howeverbe unavailable or intractable due to non-gaussian errors, non-linearmeasurements processes, or complex data formats such as catalogs and maps. inthese cases, the simulation of mock data sets can often be made through forwardmodeling. we discuss how approximate bayesian computation (abc) can be used inthese cases to derive an approximation to the posterior constraints usingsimulated data sets. this technique relies on the sampling of the parameterset, a distance metric to quantify the difference between the observation andthe simulations and summary statistics to compress the information in the data.we first review the principles of abc and discuss its implementation using apopulation monte-carlo (pmc) algorithm and the mahalanobis distance metric. wetest the performance of the implementation using a gaussian toy model. we thenapply the abc technique to the practical case of the calibration of imagesimulations for wide field cosmological surveys. we find that the abc analysisis able to provide reliable parameter constraints for this problem and istherefore a promising technique for other applications in cosmology andastrophysics. our implementation of the abc pmc method is made available via apublic code release.

astro-ph;0003008	detection of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure	we report a detection of the coherent distortion of faint galaxies arisingfrom gravitational lensing by foreground structures. this ``cosmic shear'' ispotentially the most direct measure of the mass power spectrum, as it isunaffected by poorly-justified assumptions made concerning the biasing of thedistribution. our detection is based on an initial imaging study of 14separated 8' x 16' fields observed in good, homogeneous conditions with theprime focus eev ccd camera of the 4.2m william herschel telescope. we detect anrms shear of 1.6% in 8' x 8' cells, with a significance of 3.4 sigma. wecarefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects andcarrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal fromartificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics. wealso verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shearin adjacent cells. including (gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shearvariance to be (0.016)^2 plus/minus (0.012)^2 plus/minus (0.006)^2, where these1 sigma errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties,respectively. our measurements are consistent with the predictions ofcluster-normalised cdm models (within 1 sigma) but a cobe-normalised scdm modelis ruled out at the 3.0 sigma level. for the currently-favoured lambda-cdmmodel (with omega_m = 0.3), our measurement provides a normalisation of themass power spectrum of sigma_8 = 1.5 plus/minus 0.5, fully consistent with thatderived from cluster abundances. our result demonstrates that ground-basedtelescopes can, with adequate care, be used to constrain the mass powerspectrum on various scales. the present results are limited mainly by cosmicvariance, which can be overcome in the near future with more observations.

astro-ph;0003344	two-dimensional galaxy-galaxy lensing: a direct measure of the  flattening and alignment of light and mass in galaxies	we propose a new technique to directly measure the shapes of dark matterhalos of galaxies using weak gravitational lensing. extending the standardgalaxy-galaxy lensing method, we show that the shape parameters of the massdistribution of foreground galaxies can be measured from the two-dimensionalshear field derived from background galaxies. this enables the comparison ofthe ellipticity of the mass distribution with that of the light in galaxies, aswell as an estimate of the degree of alignment between the stellar componentand dark matter. we choose the specific case of an elliptical, isothermalprofile and estimate the feasibility and significance of the detection of thissignal. the prospects for applying this technique are excellent with largeon-going surveys like the sloan digital sky survey. the expected signal issmaller, but comparable in significance to that of the mass in standardgalaxy-galaxy lensing analyses. since shapes of halos depend on the degree ofdissipation and the transfer of angular momentum during galaxy assembly,constraints obtained from our analysis will provide an important input tomodels of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0005269	intrinsic correlation of galaxy shapes: implications for weak lensing  measurements	weak gravitational lensing is now established as a powerful method to measuremass fluctuations in the universe. it relies on the measurement of smallcoherent distortions of the images of background galaxies. even low-levelcorrelations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce asignificant spurious lensing signal. these correlations are also interesting intheir own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxyformation. using $3\times 10^{4} - 10^5$ halos found in n-body simulations, wecompute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiralgalaxies assuming that the disk is perpendicular to the angular momentum of thedark matter halo. we also consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, inwhich the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed to be the same as that ofthe light. for deep lensing surveys with median redshifts $\sim 1$, we findthat intrinsic correlations of $\sim 10^{-4}$ on angular scales $\theta \sim0.1-10'$ are generally below the expected lensing signal, and contribute only asmall fraction of the excess signals reported on these scales. on larger scaleswe find limits to the intrinsic correlation function at a level $\sim 10^{-5}$,which gives a (model-dependent) range of separations for which the intrinsicsignal is about an order of magnitude below the ellipticity correlationfunction expected from weak lensing. intrinsic correlations are thus negligibleon these scales for dedicated weak lensing surveys. for wider but shallowersurveys such as supercosmos, apm and sdss, we cannot exclude the possibilitythat intrinsic correlations could dominate the lensing signal. we discuss howsuch surveys could be used to calibrate the importance of this effect, as wellas study spin-spin correlations of spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0007023	numerical simulations of weak lensing measurements	(abridged) weak gravitational lensing induces distortions on the images ofbackground galaxies, and thus provides a direct measure of mass fluctuations inthe universe. since the distortions induced by lensing on the images ofbackground galaxies are only of a few percent, a reliable measurement demandsvery accurate galaxy shape estimation and a careful treatment of systematiceffects. here, we present a study of a shear measurement method using detailedsimulations of artificial images. the images are produced using realisations ofa galaxy ensemble drawn from the hst groth strip. we consider realisticobservational effects including atmospheric seeing, psf anisotropy andpixelisation, incorporated in a manner to reproduce actual observations withthe william herschel telescope. by applying an artificial shear to thesimulated images, we test the shear measurement method proposed by kaiser,squires &amp; broadhurst (1995, ksb). overall, we find the ksb method to bereliable with several provisos. to guide future weak lensing surveys, we studyhow seeing size, exposure time and pixelisation affect the sensitivity toshear. in addition, we study the impact of overlapping isophotes of neighboringgalaxies, and find that this effect can produce spurious lensing signals onsmall scales. we discuss the prospects of using the ksb method for future, moresensitive, surveys. numerical simulations of this kind are a required componentof present and future analyses of weak lensing surveys.

astro-ph;0012086	numerical and analytical predictions for the large-scale  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	the hot gas embedded in the large-scale structures in the universe producessecondary fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (cmb). because it isproportional to the gas pressure integrated along the line of sight, thiseffect, the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect, provides a direct measureof large-scale structure and of cosmological parameters. we study thestatistical properties of this effect using both hydrodynamical simulations andanalytical predictions from an extended halo model. the adaptive meshrefinement scheme, used in the newly developed code ramses, provides a dynamicrange of 4 order of magnitudes, and thus allows us to significantly improveupon earlier calculations. after accounting for the finite mass resolution andbox size of the simulation, we find that the halo model agrees well with thesimulations. we discuss and quantify the uncertainty in both methods, and thusderive an accurate prediction for the sz power spectrum in the 10^2&lt;l&lt;10^5range of multipole. we show how this combined analytical and numerical approachis essential for accuracy, and useful for the understanding of the physicalprocesses and scales which contribute to large-scale sz anisotropies.

astro-ph;0012196	cmb anisotropy from spatial correlations of clusters of galaxies	the sz effect from clusters of galaxies is a dominant source of secondary cmbanisotropy in the low-redshift universe. we present analytic predictions forthe cmb power spectrum from massive halos arising from the sz effect. sincehalos are discrete, the power spectrum consists of a poisson and a correlationterm. the latter is always smaller than the former, which is dominated bynearby bright rich clusters. in practice however, those bright clusters areeasy to indentify and can thus be subtracted from the map. after thissubtraction, the correlation term dominates degree-scale fluctuations over thepoisson term, as the main contribution to the correlation term comes fromdistant clusters. we find that the correlation term is detectable by planckexperiment. since the degree scale spectrum is quite insensitive to the highlyuncertain core structures of halos, our predictions are robust on these scales.measuring the correlation term on degree scales thus cleanly probes theclustering of distant halos. this has not been measured yet, mainly becauseoptical and x-ray surveys are not sufficiently sensitive to include suchdistant clusters and groups. our analytic predictions are also compared toadiabatic hydrodynamic simulations. the agreement is remarkably good, down toten arcminutes scales, indicating that our predictions are robust for theplanck experiment. below ten arcminute scales, where the details of the corestructure dominates the power spectrum, our analytic and simulated predictionsmight fail. in the near future, interferometer and bolometer array experimentswill measure the sz power spectrum down to arcminutes scales, and yield newinsight into the physics of the intrahalo medium.

astro-ph;0105179	shapelets: ii. a method for weak lensing measurements	weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to directly measure thedistribution of mass in the universe. because the distortions induced bylensing in the shape of background galaxies are small, the measurement of weaklensing requires high precision. here, we present a new method for obtainingreliable weak shear measurements. it is based on the shapelet basis functionformalism of refregier (2001), in which galaxy images are decomposed intoseveral shape components, each providing independent estimates of the localshear. the formalism affords an efficient modelling and deconvolution of thepoint spread function. using the remarkable properties of shapelets underdistortions, we construct a simple, minimum variance estimator for the shear.we describe how we implement the method in practice, and test the method usingrealistic simulated images. we find our method to be stable and reliable forconditions analogous to ground-based surveys. compared to earlier methods, ourmethod has the advantages of being accurate, linear, mathematicallywell-defined, and optimally sensitive, since it uses the full shape informationavailable for each galaxy.

astro-ph;0107085	shape reconstruction and weak lensing measurement with interferometers:  a shapelet approach	we present a new approach for image reconstruction and weak lensingmeasurements with interferometers. based on the shapelet formalism presented inrefregier (2001), object images are decomposed into orthonormal hermite basisfunctions. the shapelet coefficients of a collection of sources aresimultaneously fit on the uv plane, the fourier transform of the sky brightnessdistribution observed by interferometers. the resulting chi-square fit islinear in its parameters and can thus be performed efficiently by simple matrixmultiplications. we show how the complex effects of bandwidth smearing, timeaveraging and non-coplanarity of the array can be easily and fully correctedfor in our method. optimal image reconstruction, co-addition, astrometry, andphotometry can all be achieved using weighted sums of the derived coefficients.as an example we consider the observing conditions of the first radio survey(becker et al. 1995; white et al. 1997). we find that our method accuratelyrecovers the shapes of simulated images even for the sparse uv sampling of thissnapshot survey. using one of the first pointings, we find our method compareswell with clean, the commonly used method for interferometric imaging. ourmethod has the advantage of being linear in the fit parameters, of fitting allsources simultaneously, and of providing the full covariance matrix of thecoefficients, which allows us to quantify the errors and cross-talk in imageshapes. it is therefore well-suited for quantitative shape measurements whichrequire high-precision. in particular, we show how our method can be combinedwith the results of refregier &amp; bacon (2001) to provide an accurate measurementof weak lensing from interferometric data.

astro-ph;0701480	cosmos: 3d weak lensing and the growth of structure	we present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the hubble spacetelescope cosmos survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed inspace. we have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortionscaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as afunction of redshift. using both 2d and 3d analyses, we measure cosmologicalparameters omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, thenormalization of the matter power spectrum. the introduction of redshiftinformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces therelative sampling (or "cosmic") variance compared to recent surveys that may belarger but are only two dimensional. from the 3d analysis, we findsigma_8*(omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in thetotal budget. indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods isnow the dominant source of uncertainty. assuming instead a baseline cosmologyto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structureon both linear and non-linear physical scales. our results thus demonstrate aproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposedfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

astro-ph;0701594	dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding	ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for onlyone-sixth of the total matter in the universe. the remainder is a mysterious"dark matter" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thusneither emits nor reflects light. as dark matter cannot be seen directly usingtraditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.it does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed throughgravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by thegravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. this is a purelygeometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive toall matter -- whether baryonic or dark. here we show high fidelity maps of thelarge-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. wefind a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect inmassive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. our results areconsistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, inwhich the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filamentsthen into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas canaccumulate, and stars can be built.

astro-ph;0702140	the stability of the point spread function of the advanced camera for  surveys on the hubble space telescope and implications for weak gravitational  lensing	(abridged) we examine the spatial and temporal stability of the hst acs widefield camera (wfc) point spread function (psf) using the two square degreecosmos survey. we show that stochastic aliasing of the psf necessarily occursduring `drizzling'. this aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale is equalto the input pixel scale of 0.05''. we show that this source of psf variationcan be significantly reduced by choosing a gaussian drizzle kernel and bysetting the output pixel size to 0.03''. we show that the psf is temporallyunstable, most likely due to thermal fluctuations in the telescope's focus. wefind that the primary manifestation of this thermal drift in cosmos images isan overall slow periodic focus change. using a modified version of tinytim, wecreate undistorted stars in a 30x30 grid across the acs wfc ccds. these psfmodels are created for telescope focus values in the range -10 microns to +5microns, thus spanning the allowed range of telescope focus values. we then usethe approximately ten well measured stars in each cosmos field to pick thebest-fit focus value for each field. the tinytim model stars are then used toperform psf corrections for weak lensing allowing systematics due toincorrectly modeled psfs to be greatly reduced. we have made the software forpsf modeling using our modified version of tinytim available to theastronomical community. we show the effects of charge transfer efficiency (cte)degradation, which distorts the object in the readout direction, mimicking aweak lensing signal. we derive a parametric correction for the effect of cte onthe shapes of objects in the cosmos field as a function of observation date,position within the acs wfc field, and object flux.

astro-ph;9610248	gravitational lensing of the x-ray background by clusters of galaxies	gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies affects the cosmic x-raybackground (xrb) by altering the observed density and flux distribution ofbackground x-ray sources. at faint detection flux thresholds, the resolvedx-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component ofthe xrb appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. the diffuse x-rayintensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averagedxrb, after the subtraction of resolved sources. detection of the lensing signalwith a wide-field x-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of acluster out to its virialization boundary. in particular, we show that thelensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the xrb by the clustera1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigmalevel, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming axaf satellite.the lensing signal is fairly insensitive to the lens redshift in the range0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6. the amplitude of the lensing signal is however sensitive to thefaint end slope of the number-flux relation for unresolved x-ray sources, andcan thus help constrain models of the xrb. a search for x-ray arcs or arcletscould identify the fraction of all faint sources which originate from extendedemission of distant galaxies. the probability for a 3 sigma detection of anarclet which is stretched by a factor of about 3 after a 10^6 secondsobservation of a1689 with axaf, is roughly comparable to the fraction of allbackground x-ray sources that have an intrinsic size of order 1''.

astro-ph;9712030	theory and statistics of weak lensing from large-scale mass  inhomogeneities	weak lensing by large-scale mass inhomogeneities in the universe inducescorrelations in the observed ellipticities of distant sources. we first reviewthe harmonic analysis and statistics required of these correlations and discusscalculations for the predicted signal. we consider the ellipticity correlationfunction, the mean-square ellipticity, the ellipticity power spectrum, and aglobal maximum-likelihood analysis to isolate a weak-lensing signal from thedata. estimates for the sensitivity of a survey of a given area, surfacedensity, and mean intrinsic source ellipticity are presented. we then apply ourresults to the first radio-source survey. we predict an rms ellipticity ofroughly 0.011 in $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ pixels and 0.018 in $20' \times 20'$pixels if the power spectrum is normalized to $\sigma_8 \omega^{0.53} = 0.6$,as indicated by the cluster abundance. the signal is significantly larger insome models if the power spectrum is normalized instead to the cobe anisotropy.the uncertainty in the predictions from imprecise knowledge of the firstredshift distribution is about 25% in the rms ellipticity. we show that firstshould be able to make a statistically significant detection of a weak-lensingsignal for cluster-abundance-normalized power spectra.

astro-ph;9905090	weak lensing measurements: a revisited method and application to hst  images	the weak distortions produced by gravitational lensing in the images ofbackground galaxies provide a method to measure directly the distribution ofmass in the universe. however this technique requires high precisionmeasurements of the lensing shear and cautious corrections for systematiceffects. kaiser, squires, &amp; broadhurst (1995) proposed a method to calibratethe ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of point spread function (psf)anisotropies and camera distortions. we revisit the ksb method and show thatboth the psf and the camera distortions can be corrected for using sourcemoments, as opposed to ellipticities. we clarify the applicability of some ofthe approximations made in this method. we derive expressions for thecorrections which only involve the galaxy moments. we derive an explicitrelation between the shear and the average ellipticity. we discuss theshortcomings of the method, and test its validity using numerical simulations.as an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the hst wfpc2 cameraperformed by hoekstra et al. (1998). we confirm the presence of sizable (10%)psf ellipticities at the edge of the wfpc2 chips. we also show that the psfellipticity varies by as much as 2% over time. we use these measurements tocorrect the shape of galaxies in the hst survey strip (``groth'' strip). byconsidering the dependence of the ellipticities on object size, we show that,after corrections, the residual systematic uncertainty for galaxies with radiigreater than 0.15 arcsec, is about 0.4%, when averaged over each chip. wediscuss how these results provide good prospects for measuring weak lensing bylarge-scale structure with deep hst surveys.

0810.0003	deconstructing baryon acoustic oscillations: a comparison of methods	the baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) or baryon wiggles which are presentin the galaxy power spectrum at scales 100-150mpc/h are powerful features withwhich to constrain cosmology. the potential of these probes is such that theseare now included as primary science goals in the planning of several futuregalaxy surveys. however, there is not a uniquely defined bao method in theliterature but a range of implementations. we study the assumptions andcosmological performances of three different bao methods: the full fourierspace power spectrum [p(k)], the `wiggles only' in fourier space and thespherical harmonics power spectrum [c(l)]. we contrast the power of each methodto constrain cosmology for two fiducial surveys taken from the dark energy taskforce (detf) report and equivalent to future ground and space basedspectroscopic surveys. we find that, depending on the assumptions used, thedark energy figure of merit (fom) can change by up to a factor of 35 for agiven fiducial model and survey. we compare our results with the detfimplementation and, discuss the robustness of each probe, by quantifying thedependence of the fom with the wavenumber range. the more information used by amethod, the higher its statistical performance, but the higher its sensitivityto systematics and implementations details.
