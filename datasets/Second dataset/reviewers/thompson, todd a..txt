0902.1755	radio emission from supernova remnants: implications for post-shock  magnetic field amplification and the magnetic fields of galaxies	using observations from the literature, we show that the non-thermal radioluminosity (l) of supernova remnants (snrs) is a strong function of the averagegas surface density (sigma) of the galaxy in which the remnants reside, fromnormal spirals to luminous starbursts. we combine a simple theory for electroncooling in snrs with the observed radio luminosities to estimate the remnantmagnetic field strength (b_snr): the correlation between l and sigma impliesthat b_snr also increases with sigma. we explore two interpretations of thiscorrelation: (1) b_snr is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification,with b_snr^2 proportional to sigma and (2) b_snr results from shock-compressionof the ambient ism magnetic field (b_ism), with b_ism being larger in densergalaxies. we find that shock compression is, on average, sufficient to producethe observed radio emission from snrs in the densest starbursts; amplificationof post-shock magnetic fields is not required. by contrast, in normal spiralspost-shock field amplification (by a factor of a few - 10) is consistent withthe data; we find tentative evidence that both the alfven speed and the ratioof b_snr^2 to the post-shock pressure ("epsilon_b") are constant in snrs fromgalaxy to galaxy. we discuss observational tests that can be used todistinguish between these two interpretations of the radio luminosities ofsnrs. regardless of which is correct, the radio emission from snrs provides anupper limit to b_ism that is independent of the minimum energy assumption. forthe densest starbursts, the ism magnetic energy density is below that requiredfor hydrostatic equilibrium; thus magnetic fields are not dynamically importanton the largest scales in starbursts, in contrast with spiral galaxies like ourown. this dichotomy may have implications for galactic dynamo theory.

0906.5358	the disruption of giant molecular clouds by radiation pressure and the  efficiency of star formation in galaxies	star formation is slow, in the sense that the gas consumption time is muchlonger than the dynamical time. it is also inefficient; essentially all starformation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds (gmcs), butthe fraction of a gmc converted to stars is very small, ~5%. in the mostluminous starbursts, the gmc lifetime is shorter than the main sequencelifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role ingmc disruption. we investigate the disruption of gmcs across a wide range ofgalaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into accountthe effects of hii gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, andradiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight ondust grains. in the milky way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms,jets, hii gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. in morerapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift,ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiationpressure dominates natal cloud distribution. we predict the presence of 10-20clusters with masses ~10^7 msun in local ulirgs such as arp 220 and a similarnumber of clusters with m_* ~ 10^8 msun in high redshift clump galaxies;submillimeter galaxies will have even more massive clusters. we find that themass fraction of a gmc that ends up in stars is an increasing function of thegas surface density of a galaxy, reaching ~35% in the most luminous starbursts.furthermore, the disruption of bubbles by radiation pressure stirs theinterstellar medium to velocities of ~10 km/s in normal galaxies and to ~100km/s in ulirgs like arp 220, consistent with observations. thus, radiationpressure may play a dominant role in the ism of star-forming galaxies.

0907.0230	a spitzer/irs spectrum of the 2008 luminous transient in ngc 300:  connection to proto-planetary nebulae	we present a spitzer/irs low-resolution mid-infrared spectrum (5-14 micron)of the luminous transient discovered in the nearby galaxy ngc 300 in may 2008.the spectrum, obtained three months after discovery, shows that the transientis very luminous in the mid-ir. furthermore, the spectrum shows strong, broademission features at 8 and 12 micron that are observed in galactic carbon-richproto-planetary nebulae. combining these data with published optical andnear-ir photometry obtained at the same epoch, we find that the mid-ir excesstraced by the spitzer spectrum accounts for ~20% of the total energy output.this component can be well explained by emission from ~3x10^-4 msun ofpre-existing progenitor dust at temperature ~400 k. the spectral energydistribution of the transient also shows a near-ir excess that can be explainedby emission from newly-formed dust in the ejecta. alternatively, both thenear-ir and mid-ir excesses can together be explained by a single pre-existinggeometrically thick dust shell. in light of the new observations obtained withspitzer, we revisit the analysis of the optical spectra and kinematics, whichwere compared to the massive yellow-hypergiant irc+10420 in previous studies.we show that proto-planetary nebulae share many properties with the ngc 300transient and sn 2008s. we conclude that even though the explosion of a massivestar (&gt; 10 msun) cannot be ruled out, an explosive event on a massive (6-10msun) carbon-rich agb/super-agb or post-agb star is consistent with allobservations of the transients and their progenitors presented thus far.

0907.4161	the physics of the fir-radio correlation: i. calorimetry, conspiracy,  and implications	(abridged) the far-infrared (fir) and radio luminosities of star-forminggalaxies are linearly correlated over a very wide range in star formation rate,from normal spirals like the milky way to the most intense starbursts. usingone-zone models of cosmic ray (cr) injection, cooling, and escape instar-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed fir-radiocorrelation over its entire span. we show that ~2% of the kinetic energy fromsupernova explosions must go into primary cr electrons and that ~10 - 20% mustgo into primary cr protons. secondary electrons and positrons are likelycomparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. wediscuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths ofstarbursts, the detectability of starbursts by fermi, and cosmic ray feedback.overall, our models indicate that both cr protons and electrons escape from lowsurface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping densestarbursts. the fir-radio correlation is caused by a combination of theefficient cooling of cr electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracyof several factors. for lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radioemission caused by cr escape is balanced by the decreasing fir emission causedby the low effective uv dust opacity. in starbursts, bremsstrahlung,ionization, and inverse compton cooling decrease the radio emission, but theyare countered by secondary electrons/positrons and the decreasing criticalsynchrotron frequency, which both increase the radio emission. our conclusionshold for a broad range of variations on our fiducial model.

0908.4088	a maximum stellar surface density in dense stellar systems	we compile observations of the surface mass density profiles of dense stellarsystems, including globular clusters in the milky way and nearby galaxies,massive star clusters in nearby starbursts, nuclear star clusters in dwarfspheroidals and late-type disks, ultra-compact dwarfs, and galaxy spheroidsspanning the range from low-mass cusp bulges and ellipticals to massive coreellipticals. we show that in all cases the maximum stellar surface densityattained in the central regions of these systems is similar, sigma_max ~ 10^11m_sun/kpc^2 (~20 g/cm^2), despite the fact that the systems span 7 orders ofmagnitude in total stellar mass m_star, 5 in effective radius r_e, and have awide range in effective surface density m_star/r_e^2. the surface density limitis reached on a wide variety of physical scales in different systems and isthus not a limit on three-dimensional stellar density. given the very differentformation mechanisms involved in these different classes of objects, we arguethat a single piece of physics likely determines sigma_max. the radiationfields and winds produced by massive stars can have a significant influence onthe formation of both star clusters and galaxies, while neither supernovae norblack hole accretion are important in star cluster formation. we thus concludethat feedback from massive stars likely accounts for the observed sigma_max,plausibly because star formation reaches an eddington-like flux that regulatesthe growth of these diverse systems. this suggests that current models ofgalaxy formation, which focus on feedback from supernovae and active galacticnuclei, are missing a crucial ingredient.

0910.0478	the physics of the fir-radio correlation: ii. synchrotron emission as a  star-formation tracer in high-redshift galaxies	we construct one-zone steady-state models of cosmic ray (cr) injection,cooling, and escape over the entire dynamic range of the fir-radio correlation(frc), from normal galaxies to starbursts, over the redshift interval 0 &lt;= z &lt;=10. normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,because inverse compton (ic) losses off the cmb cool cr electrons and positronsrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. however, we find thatthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, becauseescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight ic losses act to counter thiseffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. the radio dimming ofstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition betweenmagnetic field energy density and the cmb energy density; the cmb must alsocompete with every other loss process. we predict relations for the criticalredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0frc as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. additionally, weprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of somehigh-z submillimeter galaxies. we show that at fixed star formation ratesurface density, galaxies with larger cr scale heights are radio bright withrespect to the frc, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization lossescompared to compact starbursts. we predict that these "puffy starbursts" shouldhave steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star-formationrate surface density. we find that radio bright submillimeter galaxies alonecannot explain the excess radio emission reported by arcade2, but they maysignificantly enhance the diffuse radio background with respect to a naiveapplication of the z ~ 0 frc.

0911.3665	slow diffusive gravitational instability before decoupling	radiative diffusion damps acoustic modes at large comoving wavenumber (k)before decoupling (``silk damping''). in a simple wkb analysis, neglectingmoments of the temperature distribution beyond the quadrupole, damping appearsin the acoustic mode as a term of order ik^2/(taudot) where taudot is thescattering rate per unit conformal time. although the jeans instability isstabilized on scales smaller than the adiabatic jeans length, i show that themedium is linearly unstable to first order in (1/taudot) to a slow diffusivemode. at large comoving wavenumber, the characteristic growth rate becomesindependent of spatial scale and constant: (t_{kh}a)^-1 ~ (128 pi g/9 kappa_tc)(rho_m/rho_b), where "a" is the scale factor, rho_m and rho_b are the matterand baryon energy density, respectively, and kappa_t is the thomson opacity.this is the characteristic timescale for a fluid parcel to radiate away itsthermal energy content at the eddington limit, analogous to the kelvin-helmholz(kh) time for a massive star or the salpeter time for black hole growth.although this mode grows at all times prior to decoupling and on scales smallerthan the horizon, the growth time is long, about 100 times the age of theuniverse at decoupling. thus, it modifies the density and temperatureperturbations on small scales only at the percent level. the physics of thismode is already accounted for in the popular codes cmbfast and camb, but istypically neglected in analytic studies of the growth of primordialperturbations. this work clarifies the physics of this instability in the epochbefore decoupling, and emphasizes that the universe is formally unstable onscales below the horizon, even in the limit of large taudot. analogousinstabilities at yet earlier epochs are also mentioned.

0912.0009	a high rate of white dwarf-neutron star mergers &amp; their transients	we argue that the recent groundbreaking discovery by badenes et al. (2009) ofa nearby (~50 pc) white dwarf-neutron star (or black hole) binary (sdss1257+5428) with a merger timescale ~500 myr implies that such systems arecommon; we estimate that there are of order 10^6 in the galaxy. althoughsubject to large uncertainties, the nominal derived merger rate is ~5 x 10^-4per yr in the milky way, just ~3-6 and ~20-40 times less than the type ia andcore-collapse supernova (sn) rates, respectively. this implies that the mergerrate is ~0.5-1 x 10^4 per gpc^3 per yr in the local universe, ~5000-10000 timesmore than the observed (beaming-uncorrected) long-duration gamma-ray burst(grb) rate. we estimate the lower limit on the rate in the galaxy to be &gt;2.5 x10^-5 per yr at 95% confidence. we briefly discuss the implications of thisfinding for the census of long- and short-duration grbs and their progenitors,the frequency of tight binary companions to type ib/c sn progenitors, theorigin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs), the formation of rapidlyrotating neutron stars and ~2-3 m_sun black holes, the census of faint ia-likesne, as well as for upcoming and current transient surveys (e.g., loss, ptf,lsst), and for high- (ligo) and low-frequency (lisa) gravitational wavesearches.

1005.4419	radiation pressure from massive star clusters as a launching mechanism  for super-galactic winds	galactic outflows of low ionization, cool gas are ubiquitous in localstarburst galaxies, and in the majority of galaxies at high redshift. how thesecool outflows arise is still in question. hot gas from supernovae has long beensuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendencyto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. we propose a modificationof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.  star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, thebulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. we showthat, for l* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with m&gt;10^6 m_sunis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circularvelocity of the disk galaxy. this cool gas can travel above the galactic diskin less than 2 myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.once above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, andsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, whichdrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. because theradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gasis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction ifthey do eventually encounter hot gas. therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,radiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. we identify thesecluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. another implication ofour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, areable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. wefind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cooloutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreementwith observations.

1005.4691	radiation pressure driven galactic winds from self-gravitating discs	(abridged) we study large-scale winds driven from uniformly brightself-gravitating discs radiating near the eddington limit. we show that theratio of the radiation pressure force to the gravitational force increases withheight above the disc surface to a maximum of twice the value of the ratio atthe disc surface. thus, uniformly bright self-gravitating discs radiating atthe eddington limit are fundamentally unstable to driving large-scale winds.these results contrast with the spherically symmetric case, wheresuper-eddington luminosities are required for wind formation. we apply thistheory to galactic winds from rapidly star-forming galaxies that approach theeddington limit for dust. for hydrodynamically coupled gas and dust, we findthat the asymptotic velocity of the wind is v_\infty ~ 1.5 v_rot and thatv_\infty sfr^{0.36}, where v_rot is the disc rotation velocity and sfr is thestar formation rate, both of which are in agreement with observations. however,these results of the model neglect the gravitational potential of thesurrounding dark matter halo and an old passive stellar bulge or extended disc,which act to decrease v_\infty. a more realistic treatment shows that the flowcan either be unbound, or bound, forming a "fountain flow" with a typicalturning timescale of t_turn ~ 0.1-1 gyr. we provide quantitative criteria andscaling relations for assessing whether or not a rapidly star-forming galaxy ofgiven properties can drive unbound flows via the mechanism described in thispaper. importantly, we note that because t_turn is longer than the starformation timescale in the rapidly star-forming galaxies and ulirgs for whichour theory is most applicable, if rapidly star-forming galaxies are selected assuch, they may be observed to have strong outflows, even though their winds areeventually bound on large scales.

1011.0955	assessing radiation pressure as a feedback mechanism in star-forming  galaxies	radiation pressure from the absorption and scattering of starlight by dustgrains may be an important feedback mechanism in regulating star-forminggalaxies. we compile data from the literature on star clusters, star-formingsubregions, normal star-forming galaxies, and starbursts to assess theimportance of radiation pressure on dust as a feedback mechanism, by comparingthe luminosity and flux of these systems to their dust eddington limit. thisexercise motivates a novel interpretation of the schmidt law, the lir-l'cocorrelation, and the lir-l'hcn correlation. in particular, the linear lir-l'hcncorrelation is a natural prediction of radiation pressure regulated starformation. overall, we find that the eddington limit sets a hard upper bound tothe luminosity of any star-forming region. importantly, however, many normalstar-forming galaxies have luminosities significantly below the eddingtonlimit. we explore several explanations for this discrepancy, especially therole of "intermittency" in normal spirals - the tendency for only a smallnumber of subregions within a galaxy to be actively forming stars at any momentbecause of the time-dependence of the feedback process and the luminosityevolution of the stellar population. if radiation pressure regulates starformation in dense gas, then the gas depletion timescale is 6 myr, in goodagreement with observations of the densest starbursts. finally, we highlightthe importance of observational uncertainties - namely, the dust-to-gas ratioand the co-h2 and hcn-h2 conversion factors - that must be understood before adefinitive assessment of radiation pressure as a feedback mechanism instar-forming galaxies.

1106.3115	the impact of metallicity on the rate of type ia supernovae	the metallicity of a star strongly affects both its evolution and theproperties of the stellar remnant that results from its demise. it is generallyaccepted that stars with initial masses below ~8 m_sun leave behind whitedwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to type ia supernovae.however, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rateof sne ia. we propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is tosignificantly increase the sn ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, incontrast to previous expectations. this is because lower-metallicity starsleave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring toexplosion. we first model sn ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and agesalone, finding that the elevation in the rate of sne ia in lower-mass galaxiesmeasured by loss is readily explained. however, we then see that modelsincorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. using the sameparameters to estimate the cosmic sn ia rate, we again find good agreement withdata up to z~2. we suggest that this degeneracy warrants more detailedexamination of host galaxy metallicities. we discuss additional implications,including for hosts of high-z sne ia, the sn ia delay time distribution,super-chandrasekhar sne, and cosmology.

1106.5718	effect of collective neutrino oscillations on the neutrino mechanism of  core-collapse supernovae	in the seconds after collapse of a massive star, the newborn proto-neutronstar (pns) radiates neutrinos of all flavors. the absorption of electron-typeneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the"neutrino mechanism"). because the heating rate is proportional to the squareof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-typeneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (cnuo) may in principle increasethe heating rate and drive explosions. in order to assess the potentialimportance of cnuo for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundaryvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the pns surface (r_nu)and the shock (r_s), including a scheme for flavor conversion via cnuo. for agiven r_nu, pns mass (m), accretion rate (mdot), and assumed values of theneutrino energies from the pns, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosityabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. we show that cnuocan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only ifthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_s and if there is no mattersuppression. the magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (m,mdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavorconversion. we quantify these dependencies and find that cnuo could lower thecritical luminosity only for small m and mdot, and large r_nu. however, forthese parameter values cnuo are suppressed due to matter effects. byquantifying the importance of cnuo and matter suppression at the criticalneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studiesthat cnuo are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapsesupernovae significantly.

0710.1326	magnetar driven bubbles and the origin of collimated outflows from grbs	we model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidlyrotating magnetar and the surrounding progenitor. in the first few secondsafter core collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magneticfields behind the supernova shock, which expands asymmetrically because of thepinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, as in pwne, even if the hoststar is spherically symmetric. the degree of asymmetry depends on the ratio ofthe magnetic energy to the total energy in the bubble. we assume that the windby newly formed magnetars inflating these bubbles is more magnetized than forpwne. we show that for a magnetic to total power supplied by the centralmagnetar $\sim 0.1$ the bubble expands relatively spherically while for valuesgreater than 0.3, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to therotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. this canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (grbs). given that the wind magnetization increases in time,we thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relativelyspherically (enhancing the energy of the associated supernova) while at latetimes it becomes progressivelymore collimated (producing the grb). similarprocesses may operate in more modestly rotating neutron stars to produceasymmetric supernovae and lower energy transients such as x-ray flashes.

1203.2926	direct numerical simulation of radiation pressure-driven turbulence and  winds in star clusters and galactic disks	[abridged] the pressure exerted by the radiation of young stars may be animportant feedback mechanism in forming star clusters and the disks ofstarburst galaxies. however, there is great uncertainty in how efficientlyradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. inparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,and whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise toheavily mass-loaded winds. in this paper we report a series of two-dimensionalflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with thecode orion in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dustymatter confined by gravity. we consider both systems where the radiation fluxis sub-eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-eddington atthe midplane but sub-eddington in the atmosphere. in the latter, we find thatthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven rayleigh-taylorinstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fullyexplain the turbulence seen in galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make anon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.however, the instability also produces a channel structure in which theradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is notfully trapped. for astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clustersand starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentumdeposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simpleanalytic estimates, and that in steady state the eddington ratio reaches unityand there are no strong winds. we provide an approximation formula, appropriatefor implementation in analytic models and non-radiative simulations, for theforce exerted by the infrared radiation field in this regime.

1204.5478	the observed neutron star mass distribution as a probe of the supernova  explosion mechanism	the observed distribution of neutron star (ns) masses reflects the physics ofcore-collapse supernova explosions and the structure of the massive stars thatproduce them at the end of their evolution. we present a bayesian analysis thatdirectly compares the ns mass distribution observed in double ns systems totheoretical models of ns formation. we find that models with standard binarymass ratio distributions are strongly preferred over independently picking themasses from the initial mass function, although the strength of the inferencedepends on whether current assumptions for identifying the remnants of theprimary and secondary stars are correct. second, ns formation models with nomass fallback are favored because they reduce the dispersion in ns masses. thedouble ns system masses thus directly point to the mass coordinate where thesupernova explosion was initiated, making them an excellent probe of thesupernova explosion mechanism. if we assume no fallback and simply vary themass coordinate separating the remnant and the supernova ejecta, we find thatfor solar metallicity stars the explosion most likely develops at the edge ofthe iron core at a specific entropy of about 2.8 k_b. the primary limitationsof our study are the poor knowledge of the supernova explosion mechanism andthe lack of broad range of sn model explosions of lmc to solar metallicity.

0712.1233	short duration gamma-ray bursts with extended emission from  proto-magnetar spin-down	evidence is growing for a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) characterized byan initial ~0.1-1 s spike of hard radiation followed, after a ~3-10 s lull inemission, by a softer period of extended emission lasting ~10-100 s. in a fewwell-studied cases, these ``short grbs with extended emission'' show noevidence for a bright associated supernova (sn). we propose that these eventsare produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,rapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from theaccretion-induced collapse (aic) of a white dwarf (wd), the merger and collapseof a wd-wd binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. theinitial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from asmall disk that is formed during the aic or merger event. the extended emissionis produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of theproto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. the ~3-10 s delay between the promptand extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetarto cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomesultra-relativistic. because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no ni56 (&lt; 1e-3m_sun), these events should not produce a bright sn-like transient. we modelthe extended emission from grb060614 using spin-down calculations of a coolingproto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetarwith an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3e15 g.if grbs are indeed produced by aic or wd-wd mergers, they should occur within amixture of both early and late-type galaxies and should not produce stronggravitational wave emission. an additional consequence of our model is theexistence of x-ray flashes unaccompanied by a bright sn.

1302.0287	effects of stellar rotation on star formation rates and comparison to  core-collapse supernova rates	we investigate star formation rate (sfr) calibrations in light of recentdevelopments in the modeling of stellar rotation. using new publishednon-rotating and rotating stellar tracks, we study the integrated properties ofsynthetic stellar populations and find that the uv to sfr calibration for therotating stellar population is 30% smaller than for the non-rotating stellarpopulation, and 40% smaller for the halpha to sfr calibration. these reductionstranslate to smaller sfr estimates made from observed uv and halphaluminosities. using the uv and halpha fluxes of a sample of ~300 localgalaxies, we derive a total (i.e., sky-coverage corrected) sfr within 11 mpc of120-170 msun/yr and 80-130 msun/yr for the non-rotating and rotatingestimators, respectively. independently, the number of core-collapse supernovaediscovered in the same volume requires a total sfr of 270^{+110}_{-80} msun/yr,suggesting a mild tension with the sfr estimates made with rotatingcalibrations. more generally, when compared with the estimated sfr, the localsupernova discoveries strongly constrain any physical effects that mightincrease the energy output of massive stars, including, but not limited to,stellar rotation. the cosmic sfr and cosmic supernova rate data on the otherhand show the opposite trend, with the cosmic sfr almost double that inferredfrom cosmic supernovae, constraining a significant decrease in the energyoutput of massive stars. together, these lines of evidence suggest that thetrue sfr calibration factors cannot be too far from their canonical values.

1302.4440	numerical simulations of radiatively-driven dusty winds	[abridged] radiation pressure on dust grains may be an important mechanism indriving winds in a wide variety of astrophysical systems. however, theefficiency of the coupling between the radiation field and the dusty gas ispoorly understood in environments characterized by high optical depths. wepresent a series of idealized numerical experiments, performed with theradiation-hydrodynamic code orion, in which we study the dynamics of such windsand quantify their properties. we find that, after wind acceleration begins,radiation rayleigh-taylor instability forces the gas into a configuration thatreduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas by afactor ~ 10 - 100 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at thebase of the atmosphere; instead, the rate of momentum transfer from a drivingradiation field of luminosity l to the gas is roughly l/c multiplied by oneplus half the optical depth evaluated using the photospheric temperature, whichis far smaller than the optical depth one would obtain using the interiortemperature. when we apply our results to conditions appropriate to ulirgs andstar clusters, we find that the asymptotic wind momentum flux from such objectsshould not significantly exceed that carried by the direct radiation field,l/c. this result constrains the expected mass loss rates from systems thatexceed the eddington limit to be of order the so-called "single-scattering"limit, and not significantly higher. we present an approximate fitting formulafor the rate of momentum transfer from radiation to dusty gas through which itpasses, which is suitable for implementation in sub-grid models of galaxyformation. finally, we provide a first map of the column density distributionof gas in a radiatively-driven wind as a function of velocity, and velocitydispersion.

1311.6778	probing cosmic-ray ion acceleration with radio-submm and gamma-ray  emission from interaction-powered supernovae	the optical and near-ir emission from some classes of supernovae (sne),including type iin and possibly some super-luminous sne, is likely powered by acollision between the sn ejecta and dense circumstellar material (csm). weargue that for a range of csm masses and their radii, a collisionless shock canform, allowing for efficient cosmic-ray (cr) acceleration. we show that ppcollisions between these newly accelerated crs and the csm leads to not onlygamma rays but also secondary electrons and positrons that radiate synchrotronphotons in the high-frequency radio bands. our estimates imply that variousfacilities including the jansky very large array (vla) and the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) may observe such sne at gpc distances byfollowup observations in months-to-years, although the detectability stronglydepends on the csm density as well as observed frequency. detecting this signalwould give us a unique probe of cr acceleration at early times, and evennon-detections can put interesting limits on the possibility of cr ionacceleration. following our previous work, we also show that gev gamma rays canescape from the system without severe attenuation, encouraging point-source andstacking analyses with fermi. we provide recipes for diagnosinginteraction-powered sn scenario with multi-messenger (neutrino and gamma-ray)observations.

1401.1505	the pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey (paws): environmental dependence of  giant molecular cloud properties in m51	using data from the pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey (paws), we have generatedthe largest extragalactic giant molecular cloud (gmc) catalog to date,containing 1,507 individual objects. gmcs in the inner m51 disk account foronly 54% of the total 12co(1-0) luminosity of the survey, but on average theyexhibit physical properties similar to galactic gmcs. we do not find a strongcorrelation between the gmc size and velocity dispersion, and a simple virialanalysis suggests that 30% of gmcs in m51 are unbound. we have analyzed the gmcproperties within seven dynamically-motivated galactic environments, findingthat gmcs in the spiral arms and in the central region are brighter and havehigher velocity dispersions than inter-arm clouds. globally, the gmc massdistribution does not follow a simple power law shape. instead, we find thatthe shape of the mass distribution varies with galactic environment: thedistribution is steeper in inter-arm region than in the spiral arms, andexhibits a sharp truncation at high masses for the nuclear bar region. wepropose that the observed environmental variations in the gmc properties andmass distributions are a consequence of the combined action of large-scaledynamical processes and feedback from high mass star formation. we describesome challenges of using existing gmc identification techniques for decomposingthe 12co(1-0) emission in molecule-rich environments, such as m51's inner disk.

1401.3759	the pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey (paws): multi-phase cold gas  kinematic of m51	the kinematic complexity and the favorable position of m51 on the sky makethis galaxy an ideal target to test different theories of spiral arm dynamics.taking advantage of the new high resolution pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey(paws) data, we undertake a detailed kinematic study of m51 to characterize andquantify the origin and nature of the non-circular motions. using a tilted-ringanalysis supported by several other archival datasets we update the estimationof m51's position angle (pa=(173 +/- 3) deg) and inclination (i=(22 +/- 5)deg). harmonic decomposition of the high resolution (40 pc) co velocity fieldshows the first kinematic evidence of an m=3 wave in the inner disk of m51 witha corotation at r(cr,m=3)=1.1 +/- 0.1 kpc and a pattern speed of omega_p(m=3) =140 km/(s kpc). this mode seems to be excited by the nuclear bar, while thebeat frequencies generated by the coupling between the m=3 mode and the mainspiral structure confirm its density-wave nature. we observe also a signatureof an m=1 mode that is likely responsible for the lopsidedness of m51 at smalland large radii. we provide a simple method to estimate the radial variation ofthe amplitude of the spiral perturbation (vsp) attributed to the differentmodes. the main spiral arm structure has &lt;vsp&gt;=50-70 km/s, while the streamingvelocity associated with the m=1 and m=3 modes is, in general, 2 times lower.our joint analysis of hi and co velocity fields at low and high spatialresolution reveals that the atomic and molecular gas phases respond differentlyto the spiral perturbation due to their different vertical distribution andemission morphology.

1406.4128	the signature of single-degenerate accretion induced collapse	the accretion induced collapse (aic) of a white dwarf to a neutron star haslong been suggested as a natural theoretical outcome in stellar evolution, butthere has never been a direct detection of such an event. this is notsurprising since the small amount of radioactive nickel synthesized($\sim10^{-3}\,m_\odot$) implies a relatively dim optical transient. here weargue that a particularly strong signature of an aic would occur for anoxygen-neon-magnesium (onemg) white dwarf accreting from a star that isexperiencing roche-lobe overflow as it becomes a red giant. in such cases, the$\sim10^{50}\,{\rm erg}$ explosion from the aic collides with and shock-heatsthe surface of the extended companion, creating an x-ray flash lasting$\sim1\,{\rm hr}$ followed by an optical signature that peaks at an absolutemagnitude of $\sim -16$ to $-18$ and lasts for a few days to a week. theseevents would be especially striking in old stellar environments wherehydrogen-rich supernova-like, transients would not normally be expected.although the rate of such events is not currently known, we describe observingstrategies that could be utilized with high cadence surveys that should eitherdetect these events or place strong constraints on their rates.

1406.5206	dynamics of dusty radiation pressure driven shells and clouds: fast  outflows from galaxies, star clusters, massive stars, and agn	it is typically assumed that radiation pressure driven winds are acceleratedto an asymptotic velocity of v ~ v_esc, where v_esc is the escape velocity fromthe central source. we note that this is not the case for dusty shells andclouds. instead, if the shell or cloud is initially optically-thick to the uvemission from the source of luminosity l, then there is a significant boost inv that reflects the integral of the momentum absorbed as it is accelerated. forshells reaching a generalized eddington limit, we show that v ~ (4r_uv l/m_shc)^1/2, in both point-mass and isothermal-sphere potentials, where r_uv is theradius where the shell becomes optically-thin to uv photons, and m_sh is themass of the shell. the asymptotic velocity significantly exceeds v_esc fortypical parameters, and can explain the ~1000-2000km/s outflows observed fromrapidly star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei if the surroundinghalo has low gas density. similarly fast outflows from massive stars can beaccelerated on few - 10^3 yr timescales. these results carry over to cloudsthat subtend only a small fraction of the solid angle from the source ofradiation and that expand as a consequence of their internal sound speed. wefurther consider the dynamics of shells that sweep up a dense circumstellar orcircumgalactic medium. we calculate the "momentum ratio" mdot v/(l/c) in theshell limit and show that it can only significantly exceed ~2 if the effectiveoptical depth of the shell to re-radiated fir photons is much larger thanunity. we discuss simple prescriptions for the properties of galactic outflowsfor use in large-scale cosmological simulations. we also briefly discussapplications to the dusty ejection episodes of massive stars, the disruption ofgiant molecular clouds, and agn.

0705.1742	magnetar driven bubbles and the origin of collimated outflows in  gamma-ray bursts	we model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidlyrotating magnetar and the surrounding supernova shock and host star. thedynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shellequations. in the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetarinflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. thebubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidalmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsarwind nebulae. the degree of asymmetry depends on e_mag/e_tot. the correct valueof e_mag/e_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion ofmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; weargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely tobe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. we show thatfor a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetarl_mag/l_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. for l_mag/l_tot ~0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to therotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. this canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (grbs). outflows from magnetars become increasinglymagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-drivenmass loss as the young neutron star cools. we thus suggest that themagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing theenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomesprogressively more collimated, producing the grb.

1411.0932	high-resolution radio continuum measurements of the nuclear disks of arp  220	we present new karl g. jansky very large array radio continuum images of thenuclei of arp 220, the nearest ultra-luminous infrared galaxy. these imageshave both the angular resolution to study detailed morphologies of the twonuclei that power the system and sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales.at 33 ghz, and with a resolution of 0".081 x 0".063 (29.9 x 23.3 pc), weresolve the emission surrounding both nuclei and conclude that is mostlysynchrotron in nature. the spatial distributions of radio emission in bothnuclei are well described by exponential profiles. these have deconvolvedhalf-light radii of 51 and 35 pc for the eastern and western nuclei, and theymatch the number density profile of radio supernovae observed with very longbaseline interferometry. this similarity might be due to the fast cooling ofcosmic rays electrons caused by the presence of a strong (~ mg) magnetic fieldin this system. we estimate high luminosity surface densities of$\mathrm{\sigma_{ir} \sim 4.2^{+1.6}_{-0.7} \times 10^{13}}$ (east) and$\mathrm{\sim 9.7^{+3.7}_{-2.4} \times 10^{13}~(west)~l_{\odot}~kpc^{-2}}$, andstar formation rate surface densities of $\mathrm{\sigma_{sfr} \sim10^{3.7\pm0.1}}$ (east) and $\mathrm{\sim10^{4.1\pm0.1}~(west)~m_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. these values, especiallyfor the western nucleus are, to our knowledge, the highest luminosity and starformation rate surface densities measured for any star-forming system. despitethese high values, the nuclei lie below the dusty eddington limit in whichradiation pressure is balanced only by self-gravity. the small measured sizesalso imply that the nuclei of arp 220 are only transparent in the frequencyrange ~ 5 to 350 ghz. our results offer no clear evidence that an activegalactic nucleus dominates the emission from either nucleus at 33 ghz.

1411.1769	sub-eddington star-forming regions are super-eddington: momentum driven  outflows from supersonic turbulence	we show that the turbulent gas in the star-forming regions of galaxies isunstable to wind formation via momentum deposition by radiation pressure orother momentum sources like supernova explosions, even if the system is belowthe average eddington limit. this conclusion follows from the fact that thecritical momentum injection rate per unit mass for unbinding gas from aself-gravitating system is proportional to the gas surface density and that aturbulent medium presents a broad distribution of column densities to thesources. for an average eddington ratio of &lt;gamma&gt;~0.1 and for turbulent machnumbers &gt;30, we find that ~1% of the gas is ejected per dynamical timescale atvelocities larger than the local escape velocity. because of the lognormalshape of the surface density distribution, the mass loss rate is highlysensitive to the average eddington ratio, reaching 20-40% of the gas mass perdynamical time for &lt;gamma&gt;=1. using this model we find a large scatter in themass-loading factor for star-forming galaxies, ranging from 0.001-10, but withsignificant uncertainties. implications for the efficiency of star formation ingiant molecular clouds are highlighted. for radiation pressure feedback alone,we find an increasing star formation efficiency as a function of initial gassurface density. uncertainties are discussed.

0804.3403	gravitational instability in radiation pressure dominated backgrounds	i consider the physics of gravitational instabilities in the presence ofdynamically important radiation pressure and gray radiative diffusion, governedby a constant opacity, kappa. for any non-zero radiation diffusion rate on anoptically-thick scale, the medium is unstable unless the classical gas-onlyisothermal jeans criterion is satisfied. when diffusion is "slow," although thedynamical jeans instability is stabilized by radiation pressure on scalessmaller than the adiabatic jeans length, on these same spatial scales themedium is unstable to a diffusive mode. in this regime, neglecting gaspressure, the characteristic timescale for growth is independent of spatialscale and given by (3 kappa c_s^2)/(4 pi g c), where c_s is the adiabatic soundspeed. this timescale is that required for a fluid parcel to radiate away itsthermal energy content at the eddington limit, the kelvin-helmholz timescalefor a radiation pressure supported self-gravitating object. in the limit of"rapid" diffusion, radiation does nothing to suppress the jeans instability andthe medium is dynamically unstable unless the gas-only jeans criterion issatisfied. i connect with treatments of silk damping in the early universe. idiscuss several applications, including photons diffusing in regions of extremestar formation (starburst galaxies &amp; pc-scale agn disks), and the diffusion ofcosmic rays in normal galaxies and galaxy clusters. the former (particularly,starbursts) are "rapidly" diffusing and thus cannot be supported againstdynamical instability in the linear regime by radiation pressure alone. thelatter are more nearly "slowly" diffusing. i speculate that the turbulence instarbursts may be driven by the dynamical coupling between the radiation fieldand the self-gravitating gas, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields.

1504.04528	short gmc lifetimes: an observational estimate with the pdbi arcsecond  whirlpool survey (paws)	we describe and execute a novel approach to observationally estimate thelifetimes of giant molecular clouds (gmcs). we focus on the cloud populationbetween the two main spiral arms in m51 (the inter-arm region) where clouddestruction via shear and star formation feedback dominates over formationprocesses. by monitoring the change in gmc number densities and properties fromone side of the inter-arm to the other, we estimate the lifetime as a fractionof the inter-arm travel time. we find that gmc lifetimes in m51's inter-arm arefinite and short, 20 to 30 myr. such short lifetimes suggest that cloudevolution is influenced by environment, in which processes can disrupt gmcsafter a few free-fall times. over most of the region under investigation shearappears to regulate the lifetime. as the shear timescale increases withgalactocentric radius, we expect cloud destruction to switch primarily to starformation feedback at larger radii. we identify a transition from shear- tofeedback-dominated disruption through a change in the behavior of the gmcnumber density. the signature suggests that shear is more efficient atcompletely dispersing clouds, whereas feedback transforms the population, e.g.by fragmenting high mass clouds into lower mass pieces. compared to thecharacteristic timescale for molecular hydrogen in m51, our short lifetimessuggest that gas can remain molecular while clouds disperse and reassemble. wepropose that galaxy dynamics regulates the cycling of molecular material fromdiffuse to bound (and ultimately star-forming) objects, contributing to longobserved molecular depletion times in normal disk galaxies. we also speculatethat, in more extreme environments such as elliptical galaxies and concentratedgalaxy centers, star formation can be suppressed when the shear timescalebecomes so short that some clouds can not survive to collapse and form stars.

1507.01951	entrainment in trouble: cool cloud acceleration and destruction in hot  supernova-driven galactic winds	efficient thermalization of overlapping supernovae within star-forminggalaxies may produce a supernova-heated fluid that drives galactic winds. forfiducial assumptions about the timescale for kelvin-helmholz (kh) instabilitiesfrom high-resolution simulations (which neglect magnetic fields) we show thatcool clouds with temperature from t_c ~ 10^2-10^4 k seen in emission andabsorption in galactic winds cannot be accelerated to observed velocities bythe ram pressure of a hot wind. taking into account both the radial structureof the hot flow and gravity, we show that this conclusion holds over a widerange of galaxy, cloud, and hot wind properties. this finding calls intoquestion the prevailing picture whereby the cool atomic gas seen in galacticwinds is entrained and accelerated by the hot flow. given these difficultieswith ram pressure acceleration, we discuss alternative models for the origin ofhigh velocity cool gas outflows. another possibility is that magnetic fields incool clouds are sufficiently important that they prolong the cloud's life. fort_c = 10^3 k and 10^4 k clouds, we show that if conductive evaporation can beneglected, the kh timescale must be ~ 10 and 3 times longer, respectively, thanthe values from hydrodynamical simulations in order for cool cloud velocitiesto reach those seen in observations.

1507.04362	an origin for multi-phase gas in galactic winds and halos	the physical origin of high velocity cool gas seen in galactic winds remainsunknown. following wang (1995), we argue that radiative cooling in initiallyhot thermally-driven outflows can produce fast neutral atomic and photoionizedcool gas. the inevitability of adiabatic cooling from the flow's initial10^7-10^8k temperature and the shape of the cooling function for t&lt;10^7k implythat outflows with hot gas mass-loss rate relative to star formation rate ofbeta=mdot_hot/mdot_star &gt; 0.5 cool radiatively on scales ranging from the sizeof the energy injection region to tens of kpc. we highlight the beta and starformation rate surface density dependence of the column density, emissionmeasure, radiative efficiency, and velocity. at r_cool, the gas produces x-rayand then uv/optical line emission with a total power bounded by 10^{-2} l_starif the flow is powered by steady-state star formation with luminosity l_star.the wind is thermally unstable at r_cool, potentially leading to a multi-phasemedium. cooled winds decelerate significantly in the extended gravitationalpotential of galaxies. the cool gas precipitated from hot outflows may explainits prevalence in galactic halos. we forward a picture of winds whereby coolclouds are initially accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot flow, but arerapidly shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities, thereby increasing beta,seeding radiative and thermal instability, and cool gas rebirth. if the cooledwind shocks as it sweeps up the circumgalactic medium, its cooling time isshort, thus depositing cool gas far out into the halo. finally, conduction candominate energy transport in low-beta hot winds, leading to flatter temperatureprofiles than otherwise expected, potentially consistent with x-rayobservations of some starbursts.

astro-ph;0401555	magnetar spindown, hyper-energetic supernovae, and gamma ray bursts	the kelvin-helmholtz cooling epoch, lasting tens of seconds after the birthof a neutron star in a successful core-collapse supernova, is accompanied by aneutrino-driven wind. for magnetar-strength ($\sim10^{15}$ g) large scalesurface magnetic fields, this outflow is magnetically-dominated during theentire cooling epoch.because the strong magnetic field forces the wind toco-rotate with the protoneutron star,this outflow can significantly effect theneutron star's early angular momentum evolution, as in analogous models ofstellar winds (e.g. weber &amp; davis 1967). if the rotational energy is large incomparison with the supernova energy and the spindown timescale is short withrespect to the time required for the supernova shockwave to traverse thestellar progenitor, the energy extracted may modify the supernova shockdynamics significantly. this effect is capable of producing hyper-energeticsupernovae and, in some cases, provides conditions favorable for gamma raybursts. we estimate spindown timescales for magnetized, rotating protoneutronstars and construct steady-state models of neutrino-magnetocentrifugally drivenwinds. we find that if magnetars are born rapidly rotating, with initial spinperiods ($p$) of $\sim1$ millisecond, that of order $10^{51}-10^{52}$ erg ofrotational energy can be extracted in $\sim10$ seconds. if magnetars are bornslowly rotating ($p\gtrsim10$ ms) they can spin down to periods of $\sim1$second on the kelvin-helmholtz timescale.

astro-ph;0403224	viscosity and rotation in core-collapse supernovae	we construct models of core-collapse supernovae in one spatial dimension,including rotation, angular momentum transport, and viscous dissipationemploying an alpha-prescription. we compare the evolution of a fiducial 11m_sun non-rotating progenitor with its evolution including a wide range ofimposed initial rotation profiles (1.25&lt;p_0&lt;8 s, where p_0 is the initial,approximately solid-body, rotation period of the iron core). this range of p_0covers the region of parameter space from where rotation begins to modify thedynamics (p_0~8 s) to where angular velocities at collapse approach keplerian(p_0~1 s). assuming strict angular momentum conservation, all models in thisrange leave behind neutron stars with spin periods &lt;10 ms, shorter than thoseof most radio pulsars, but similar to those expected theoretically formagnetars at birth. a fraction of the gravitational binding energy of collapseis stored in the free energy of differential rotation. this energy source maybe tapped by viscous processes, providing a mechanism for energy depositionthat is not strongly coupled to the mass accretion rate through the stalledsupernova shock. this effect yields qualitatively new dynamics in models ofsupernovae. we explore several potential mechanisms for viscosity in thecore-collapse environment: neutrino viscosity, turbulent viscosity caused bythe magnetorotational instability (mri), and turbulent viscosity by entropy-and composition-gradient-driven convection. we argue that the mri is the mosteffective. we find that for rotation periods in the range p_0&lt;~5 s, and a rangeof viscous stresses, that the post-bounce dynamics is significantly effected bythe inclusion of this extra energy deposition mechanism; in several cases weobtain strong supernova explosions.

astro-ph;0406070	on the maximum luminosity of galaxies and their central black holes:  feedback from momentum-driven winds	we investigate large-scale galactic winds driven by momentum deposition.momentum injection is provided by (1) radiation pressure produced by thecontinuum absorption and scattering of uv photons on dust grains and (2)supernovae. uv radiation can be produced by a starburst or agn activity. weargue that momentum-driven winds are an efficient mechanism for feedback duringthe formation of galaxies. we show that above a limiting luminosity, momentumdeposition from star formation can expel a significant fraction of the gas in agalaxy. the limiting, eddington-like luminosity is $l_{\rm m}\simeq(4f_g c/g)\sigma^4$, where $\sigma$ is the galaxy velocity dispersion and $f_g$ is thegas fraction. a starburst that attains $l_{\rm m}$ moderates its star formationrate and its luminosity does not increase significantly further. we argue thatellipticals attain this limit during their growth at $z \gtrsim 1$ and thatthis is the origin of the faber-jackson relation. we show that lyman breakgalaxies and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies have luminosities near $l_{\rmm}$. star formation is unlikely to efficiently remove gas from very smallscales in galactic nuclei, i.e., scales much smaller than that of a nuclearstarburst. this gas is available to fuel a central black hole (bh). we arguethat a bh clears gas out of its galactic nucleus when the luminosity of the bhitself reaches $\approx l_{\rm m}$. this shuts off the fuel supply to the bhand may also terminate star formation in the surrounding galaxy. as a result,the bh mass is fixed to be $m_{\rm bh}\simeq (f_g \kappa_{\rm es}/\pig^2)\sigma^4$, where $\kappa_{\rm es}$ is the electron scattering opacity. thislimit is in accord with the observed $m_{\rm bh}-\sigma$ relation.

astro-ph;0503027	radiation pressure supported starburst disks and agn fueling	we consider the structure of marginally toomre-stable starburst disks underthe assumption that radiation pressure on dust grains provides the dominantvertical support against gravity. this is particularly appropriate when thedisk is optically thick to its own ir radiation, as in the central regions ofulirgs. because the disk radiates at its eddington limit, the schmidt-law forstar formation changes in the optically-thick limit, with the star formationrate per unit area scaling as sigma_g/kappa, where sigma_g is the gas surfacedensity and kappa is the mean opacity. we show that optically thick starburstdisks have a characteristic flux and dust effective temperature of f ~ 10^{13}l_sun/kpc^2 and t_eff ~ 90k, respectively. we compare our predictions withobservations and find good agreement. we extend our model from many-hundredparsec scales to sub-parsec scales and address the problem of fueling agn. weassume that angular momentum transport proceeds via global torques rather thana local viscosity. we account for the radial depletion of gas due to starformation and find a strong bifurcation between two classes of disk models: (1)solutions with a starburst on large scales that consumes all of the gas withlittle fueling of a central agn and (2) models with an outer large-scalestarburst accompanied by a more compact starburst on 1-10 pc scales and abright central agn. the luminosity of the latter models is in many casesdominated by the agn. we show that the vertical thickness of the starburst diskon pc scales can approach h ~ r, perhaps accounting for the nuclear obscurationin some type 2 agn. we also argue that the disk of young stars in the galacticcenter may be the remnant of such a compact nuclear starburst.

0809.0510	a new class of luminous transients and a first census of their massive  stellar progenitors	the progenitors of sn 2008s and the 2008 transient in ngc300 weredust-enshrouded, with extremely red mid-infrared (mir) colors and relativelylow luminosities. the transients were optically faint (-13 &lt; m_v &lt; -15)compared to normal core-collapse supernovae (sne), and their spectra exhibitednarrow emission lines. these events are unique among transient-progenitor pairsand hence constitute a new class. whether they are true sne or brightmassive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the sn rate. thisfact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction ofall massive stars have the mir colors of the sn 2008s and ngc300 progenitors,as we show using mir and optical luminosity, color, and variability propertiesof massive stars in m33. we find that the fraction of massive stars with colorsconsistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. in fact, only &lt; 10 similarobjects exist in m33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the agbsequence. that these transients are relatively common with respect to sne,while their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population,implies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives ofmany massive stars. this shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yrbefore explosion, be it death or merely eruption. we discuss the implicationsof this finding for the evolution and census of ``low-mass'' massive stars(8-12 msun), and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron-capturesne and the explosive birth of white dwarfs. a systematic census with (warm)spitzer of galaxies in the local universe for analogous progenitors wouldsignificantly improve our knowledge of this channel to massive stellarexplosions, and potentially to others with obscured progenitors.

astro-ph;0508462	the spin periods and rotational profiles of neutron stars at birth	we present results from an extensive set of one- and two-dimensionalradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the supernova core collapse, bounce, andpostbounce phases, and focus on the protoneutron star (pns) spin periods androtational profiles as a function of initial iron core angular velocity, degreeof differential rotation, and progenitor mass. for the models considered, wefind a roughly linear mapping between initial iron core rotation rate and pnsspin. the results indicate that the magnitude of the precollapse iron coreangular velocities is the single most important factor in determining the pnsspin. differences in progenitor mass and degree of differential rotation leadonly to small variations in the pns rotational period and profile. based on ourcalculated pns spins, at ~ 200-300 milliseconds after bounce, and assumingangular momentum conservation, we estimate final neutron star rotation periods.we find periods of one millisecond and shorter for initial central iron coreperiods of below ~ 10 s. this is appreciably shorter than what previous studieshave predicted and is in disagreement with current observational data frompulsar astronomy. after considering possible spindown mechanisms that couldlead to longer periods we conclude that there is no mechanism that can robustlyspin down a neutron star from ~ 1 ms periods to the "injection" periods of tensto hundreds of milliseconds observed for young pulsars. our results indicatethat, given current knowledge of the limitations of neutron star spindownmechanisms, precollapse iron cores must rotate with periods around 50-100seconds to form neutron stars with periods generically near those inferred forthe radio pulsar population.

astro-ph;0601626	magnetic fields in starburst galaxies and the origin of the fir-radio  correlation	we estimate minimum energy magnetic fields (b_min) for a sample of galaxieswith measured gas surface densities, spanning from normal spirals tostarbursts. we show that the ratio of the minimum energy magnetic pressure tothe total pressure in the ism decreases substantially with increasing surfacedensity; for arp 220 this ratio is ~10^-4. therefore, if the minimum energyestimate is applicable, magnetic fields in starbursts are dynamically weakcompared to gravity, in contrast to normal spiral galaxies. we argue, however,that rapid cooling of relativistic electrons in starbursts invalidates theminimum energy estimate. we critically assess a number of independentconstraints on the magnetic field strength in starbursts. in particular, weargue that the existence of the fir-radio correlation implies that thesynchrotron cooling timescale for cosmic ray electrons is much shorter thantheir escape time from the galactic disk; this in turn implies that the truemagnetic field in starbursts is significantly larger than b_min. the strongestargument against such large fields is that one might expect starbursts to havesteep radio spectra indicative of strong synchrotron cooling, which is notobserved. we show, however, that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses canflatten the nonthermal spectra of starburst galaxies even in the presence ofrapid cooling, providing much better agreement with observed spectra. wefurther demonstrate that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses are likely to beimportant in shaping the radio spectra of most starbursts at ghz frequencies,thereby preserving the linearity of the fir-radio correlation. we thus concludethat magnetic fields in starbursts are significantly larger than b_min. wehighlight several observations that can test this conclusion.

astro-ph;0606665	the starburst contribution to the extra-galactic gamma-ray background	cosmic ray protons interacting with gas at the mean density of theinterstellar medium in starburst galaxies lose energy rapidly via inelasticcollisions with ambient nuclei. the resulting pions produce secondary electronsand positrons, high-energy neutrinos, and gamma-ray photons. we estimate thecumulative gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies. we find a totalintegrated background above 100 mev of f_gamma ~ 10^{-6} gev/cm^2/s/sr and acorresponding specific intensity at gev energies of nui_nu ~ 10^{-7}gev/cm^2/s/sr. starbursts may thus account for a significant fraction of theextra-galactic $\gamma$-ray background. we show that the fir-radio correlationprovides a strong constraint on the gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxiesbecause pions decay into both gamma-rays and radio-emitting electron/positronpairs. we identify several nearby systems where the potential for observinggamma-ray emission is the most favorable (m82, ngc 253, and ic 342), predicttheir fluxes, and predict a linear fir-gamma-ray correlation for the denseststarbursts. if established, the fir-gamma-ray correlation would provide strongevidence for the ``calorimeter'' theory of the fir-radio correlation and wouldimply that cosmic rays in starburst galaxies interact with gas at approximatelythe mean density of the interstellar medium (ism), thereby providing animportant constraint on the physics of the ism in starbursts.

astro-ph;0608682	proto-neutron star winds with magnetic fields and rotation	we solve the 1d neutrino-heated non-relativistic mhd wind problem forconditions that range from slowly rotating (spin period p &gt; 10 ms) protoneutronstars (pnss) with surface field strengths typical of radio pulsars (b &lt; 10^13g), to "proto-magnetars" with b ~ 10^14-10^15 g in their hypothesized rapidlyrotating initial states (p ~ 1 ms). we use the simulations of bucciantini etal. (2006) to map our monopole results onto a more physical dipole geometry andto estimate the spindown of pnss when their winds are relativistic. we thenquantify the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the mass loss, energyloss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in pns winds. we describe the evolution ofpns winds through the kelvin-helmholtz cooling epoch, emphasizing thetransition between (1) thermal neutrino-driven, (2) non-relativisticmagnetically-dominated, and (3) relativistic magnetically-dominated outflows.we find that proto-magnetars with p ~ 1 ms and b &gt; 10^15 g drive relativisticwinds with luminosities, energies, and lorentz factors (magnetization sigma ~0.1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long duration gamma-raybursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (sne). a significant fraction of therotational energy may be extracted in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidlyto alter the asymptotic energy of the sn remnant, its morphology, and,potentially, its nucleosynthetic yield. winds from pnss with more modestrotation periods (2 - 10 ms) and with magnetar-strength fields produceconditions significantly more favorable for the r-process than winds fromslowly rotating pnss. lastly, we show that energy and momentum deposition byconvectively-excited waves further increase the likelihood of successfulr-process in pns winds.

astro-ph;0609213	the ionization state of sodium in galactic winds	roughly 80% of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) show blue shiftedabsorption in the resonance lines of neutral sodium, indicating that cool windsare common in such objects, as shown by rupke et al and by martin. the neutralsodium (nai) columns indicated by these absorption lines are ~10^{13}-3x10^{14}/cm^2, while the bolometric luminosity varies by a factor ofonly four. we show that the gas in ulirg outflows is likely to be inphotoionization equilibrium. the very small ulirg sample of goldader et al.demonstrates that the ratio of ultraviolet flux to far infrared flux varies bya factor $\sim100$ from object to object. while the goldader sample does notoverlap with those of rupke et al. and martin, we show that such a largevariation in ultraviolet flux will produce a similar variation in the column ofneutral sodium for a fixed mass flux and density. however, if the cold gas isin pressure equilibrium with a hot outflow with a mass loss rate similar to thestar formation rate, the range of ionization state is significantly smaller.measurements of the uv flux for objects in the martin and rupke et al. catalogswill definitively determine if photoionization effects are responsible for thewide variation seen in the sodium columns. if they are, a determination of thegas density and mass loss rate in the cool winds will follow, with attendantimprovements in our understanding of wind driving mechanisms and of the effectsof galaxies on their surroundings.

astro-ph;0611368	assessing millisecond proto-magnetars as grb central engines	magnetars are a sizable subclass of the neutron star census. their very highmagnetic field strengths are thought to be a consequence of rapid (millisecond)rotation at birth in a successful core-collapse supernova. in their first tensof seconds of existence, magnetars transition from hot, extended``proto-''magnetars to the cooled and magnetically-dominated objects weidentify $\sim10^4$ years later as soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) andanamolous x-ray pulsars (axps). millisecond proto-magnetar winds during thiscooling phase likewise transition from non-relativistic and thermally-driven tomagneto-centrifugally-driven, and finally to relativistic and poynting-fluxdominated. here we review the basic considerations associated with thattransition. in particular, we discuss the spindown of millisecondproto-magnetars throughout the kelvin-helmholtz cooling epoch. because of theirlarge reservoir of rotational energy, their association with supernovae, andthe fact that their winds are expected to become highly relativistic in theseconds after their birth, proto-magnetars have been suggested as the centralengine of long-duration gamma ray bursts. we discuss some of the issues andoutstanding questions in assessing them as such.

hep-ph;0306056	supernova neutrinos, neutrino oscillations, and the mass of the  progenitor star	we investigate the initial progenitor mass dependence of the early-phaseneutrino signal from supernovae taking neutrino oscillations into account. theearly-phase analysis has advantages in that it is not affected by the timeevolution of the density structure of the star due to shock propagation orwhether the remnant is a neutron star or a black hole. the initial mass affectsthe evolution of the massive star and its presupernova structure, which isimportant for two reasons when considering the neutrino signal. first, thedensity profile of the mantle affects the dynamics of neutrino oscillation insupernova. second, the final iron core structure determines the features of theneutrino burst, i.e., the luminosity and the average energy. we find that botheffects are rather small. this is desirable when we try to extract informationon neutrino parameters from future supernova-neutrino observations. althoughthe uncertainty due to the progenitor mass is not small for intermediate$\theta_{13}$ ($10^{-5} \lesssim \sin^{2}{2 \theta_{13}} \lesssim 10^{-3}$), wecan, nevertheless, determine the character of the mass hierarchy and whether$\theta_{13}$ is very large or very small.
