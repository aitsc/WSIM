0903.0360	candidate counterparts to the soft gamma-ray flare in the direction of  ls i +61303	context. a short duration burst reminiscent of a soft gamma-rayrepeater/anomalous x-ray pulsar behaviour was detected in the direction of ls i+61 303 by the swift satellite. while the association with this well knowngamma-ray binary is likely, a different origin cannot be excluded.  aims. we explore the error box of this unexpected flaring event and establishthe radio, near-infrared and x-ray sources in our search for any peculiaralternative counterpart.  methods. we carried out a combined analysis of archive very large array radiodata of ls i +61 303 sensitive to both compact and extended emission. we alsoreanalysed previous near infrared observations with the 3.5 m telescope of thecentro astronomico hispano aleman and x-ray observations with the chandrasatellite.  results. our deep radio maps of the ls i +61 303 environment represent asignificant advancement on previous work and 16 compact radio sources in the lsi +61 303 vicinity are detected. for some detections, we also identify nearinfrared and x-ray counterparts. extended emission features in the field arealso detected and confirmed. the possible connection of some of these sourceswith the observed flaring event is considered. based on these data, we areunable to claim a clear association between the swift-bat flare and any of thesources reported here. however, this study represents the most sophisticatedattempt to determine possible alternative counterparts other than ls i +61 303.

0907.0992	the magic highlights of the gamma ray binary ls i +61 303	the discovery of emission of tev gamma rays from x-ray binaries has triggeredan intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration, absorption,and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems. here we present thepioneering effort of the magic collaboration to understand the very high energyemission of the prototype system ls i +61 303. we report on the variable natureof the emission from ls i +61 303 and show that this emission is indeedperiodic. the system shows regular outburst at tev energies in phasephi=0.6-0.7 and detect no signal at periastron (phi~ 0.275). furthermore wefind no indication of spectral variation along the orbit of the compact objectand the spectral energy distribution is compatible with a simple power law withindex gamma=2.6+-0.2_(stat)+-0.2_(sys). to answer some of the open questionsconcerning the emission process of the tev radiation we conducted amultiwavelength campaign with the magic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift inseptember 2007. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and tev energies,with the peak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linearfit to the strictly simultaneous x-ray/tev flux pairs provides r=0.81 -0.21+0.06. here we present the observations and discuss the implications of theobtained results to the emission processes in the system.

0909.0406	radio continuum and near-infrared study of the mgro j2019+37 region	(abridged) mgro j2019+37 is an unidentified extended source of vhe gamma-raysoriginally reported by the milagro collaboration as the brightest tev source inthe cygnus region. its extended emission could be powered by either a single orseveral sources. the gev pulsar agl j2020.5+3653, discovered by agile andassociated with psr j2021+3651, could contribute to the emission from mgroj2019+37, although extrapolation of the gev spectrum does not explain thedetected multi-tev flux. our aim is to identify radio and nir sources in thefield of the extended tev source mgro j2019+37, and study potentialcounterparts that could contribute to its emission. we surveyed a region ofabout 6 square degrees with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) at thefrequency 610 mhz. we also observed the central square degree of this survey inthe nir ks-band using the 3.5 m telescope in calar alto. archival x-rayobservations of some specific fields are included. vlbi observations of aninteresting radio source were performed. we explored possible scenarios toproduce the multi-tev emission from mgro j2019+37 and studied which of thesources could be the main particle accelerator. we present a catalogue of 362radio sources detected with the gmrt in the field of mgro j2019+37, and theresults of a cross-correlation of this catalog with one obtained at nirwavelengths, as well as with available x-ray observations of the region. somepeculiar sources inside the ~1 degree uncertainty region of the tev emissionfrom mgro j2019+37 are discussed in detail, including the pulsar psr j2021+3651and its pulsar wind nebula pwn g75.2+0.1, two new radio-jet sources, the hiiregion sh 2-104 containing two star clusters, and the radio source nvssj202032+363158.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1011.4489	on the origin of correlated x-ray/vhe emission from ls i +61 303	the magic collaboration has recently reported correlated x-ray and veryhigh-energy gamma-ray emission from the gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303 during~60% of one orbit. these observations suggest that the emission in these twobands has its origin in a single particle population. we aim at improving ourunderstanding of the source behaviour by explaining the simultaneous x-ray andvhe data through a radiation model. we use a model based on a one zonepopulation of relativistic leptonic particles assuming dominant adiabaticlosses located at the position of the compact object. the adiabatic coolingtimescale is inferred from the x-ray fluxes. the model can reproduce thespectra and lightcurves in the x-ray and vhe bands. adiabatic losses could bethe key ingredient to explain the x-ray and partially the vhe lightcurves. fromthe best fit result, we obtain a magnetic field of b=0.2 g, a minimumluminosity budget of ~2x10^35 erg/s and a relatively high accelerationefficiency. in addition, our results seem to confirm that the gev emissiondetected by fermi does not come from the same parent particle population as thex-ray and vhe emission and the fermi spectrum poses a constraint on thehardness of the particle spectrum at lower energies. in the context of ourscenario, more sensitive observations would allow to constrain the inclinationangle, which could determine the nature of the compact object.

1108.4269	thermal x-ray emission from the shocked stellar wind of pulsar gamma-ray  binaries	gamma-ray loud x-ray binaries are binary systems that show non-thermalbroadband emission from radio to gamma rays. if the system comprises a massivestar and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producingbroadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsarwind. thermal x-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, butuntil now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-raybinaries. we present a semi-analytic model of the thermal x-ray emission fromthe shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that thethermal x-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-downluminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s. the lack ofthermal features in the x-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be usedto constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds. by fitting theobserved x-ray spectra of gamma-ray binaries with a source model composed of anabsorbed non-thermal power law and the computed thermal x-ray emission, we areable to derive upper limits on the spin-down luminosity of the putative pulsar.we applied this method to ls 5039, the only gamma-ray binary with a radial,powerful wind, and obtain an upper limit on the pulsar spin-down luminosity of~6x10^36 erg/s. given the energetic constraints from its high-energy gamma-rayemission, a non-thermal to spin-down luminosity ratio very close to unity maybe required.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

(high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1408.5280	discovery of the hard spectrum vhe gamma-ray source hess j1641-463	this letter reports the discovery of a remarkably hard spectrum source, hessj1641-463, by the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) in the very-highenergy (vhe) domain. hess j1641-463 remained unnoticed by the usual analysistechniques due to confusion with the bright nearby source hess j1640-465. itemerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restrictingthe analysis to events with energies above 4 tev. it shows a moderate fluxlevel of f(e &gt; 1 tev) = (3.64 +/- 0.44_stat +/- 0.73_sys) x 10^-13 cm^-2s-1,corresponding to 1.8% of the crab nebula flux above the same energy, and a hardspectrum with a photon index of gamma = 2.07 +/- 0.11_stat +/- 0.20_sys. it isa point-like source, although an extension up to gaussian width of sigma = 3arcmin cannot be discounted due to uncertainties in the h.e.s.s. psf. the vhegamma-ray flux of hess j1641-463 is found to be constant over the observedperiod when checking time binnings from year-by-year to the 28 min exposurestimescales. hess j1641-463 is positionally coincident with the radio supernovaremnant snr g338.5+0.1. no x-ray candidate stands out as a clear association,however chandra and xmm-newton data reveal some potential weak counterparts.various vhe gamma-ray production scenarios are discussed. if the emission fromhess j1641-463 is produced by cosmic ray protons colliding with the ambientgas, then their spectrum must extend close to 1 pev. this object may representa source population contributing significantly to the galactic cosmic ray fluxaround the knee.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1410.2589	search for dark matter annihilation signatures in h.e.s.s. observations  of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group are close satellites of themilky way characterized by a large mass-to-light ratio and are not expected tobe the site of non-thermal high-energy gamma-ray emission or intense starformation. therefore they are amongst the most promising candidates forindirect dark matter searches. during the last years the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesobserved five of these dwarf galaxies for more than 140 hours in total,searching for tev gamma-ray emission from annihilation of dark matterparticles. the new results of the deep exposure of the sagittarius dwarfspheroidal galaxy, the first observations of the coma berenices and fornaxdwarves and the re-analysis of two more dwarf spheroidal galaxies alreadypublished by the h.e.s.s. collaboration, carina and sculptor, are presented. inthe absence of a significant signal new constraints on the annihilationcross-section applicable to weakly interacting massive particles (wimps) arederived by combining the observations of the five dwarf galaxies. the combinedexclusion limit depends on the wimp mass and the best constraint is reached at1-2 tev masses with a cross-section upper bound of ~3.9x10-24 cm^3 s-1 at a 95%confidence level.

1411.0572	discovery of the vhe gamma-ray source hess j1832-093 in the vicinity of  snr g22.7-0.2	the region around the supernova remnant (snr) w41 contains several tevsources and has prompted the h.e.s.s. collaboration to perform deepobservations of this field of view. this resulted in the discovery of the newvery high energy (vhe) source hess j1832-093, at the position $\rm ra=18^h 32^m50^s \pm 3^s_{stat} \pm 2^s_{syst}, \rm dec=-9^\circ 22' 36'' \pm 32''_{stat}\pm 20''_{syst} (j2000)$, spatially coincident with a part of the radio shellof the neighboring remnant g22.7-0.2. the photon spectrum is well described bya power-law of index $\gamma = 2.6 \pm 0.3_{\rm stat} \pm 0.1_{\rm syst}$ and anormalization at 1 tev of $\phi_0=(4.8 \pm 0.8_{\rm stat}\pm 1.0_{\rmsyst})\,\times\,10^{-13}\,\rm{cm} ^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,tev^{-1}$. the location of thegamma-ray emission on the edge of the snr rim first suggested a signature ofescaping cosmic-rays illuminating a nearby molecular cloud. then a dedicatedxmm-newton observation led to the discovery of a new x-ray point sourcespatially coincident with the tev excess. two other scenarios were henceproposed to identify the nature of hess j1832-093. gamma-rays from inversecompton radiation in the framework of a pulsar wind nebula scenario or thepossibility of gamma-ray production within a binary system are therefore alsoconsidered. deeper multi-wavelength observations will help to shed new light onthis intriguing vhe source.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

1501.05087	the 2012 flare of pg 1553+113 seen with h.e.s.s. and fermi-lat	very high energy (vhe, $e&gt;$100 gev) $\gamma$-ray flaring activity of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object \pg\ has been detected by the \hess\telescopes. the flux of the source increased by a factor of 3 during the nightsof 2012 april 26 and 27 with respect to the archival measurements with hint ofintra-night variability. no counterpart of this event has been detected in the\fla\ data. this pattern is consistent with vhe $\gamma$ ray flaring beingcaused by the injection of ultrarelativistic particles, emitting $\gamma$ raysat the highest energies. the dataset offers a unique opportunity to constrainthe redshift of this source at \bestz\ using a novel method based on bayesianstatistics. the indication of intra-night variability is used to introduce anovel method to probe for a possible lorentz invariance violation (liv), and toset limits on the energy scale at which quantum gravity (qg) effects causingliv may arise. for the subluminal case, the derived limits are $\textrm{e}_{\rmqg,1}&gt;4.10\times 10^{17}$ gev and $\textrm{e}_{\rm qg,2}&gt;2.10\times 10^{10}$gev for linear and quadratic liv effects, respectively.
