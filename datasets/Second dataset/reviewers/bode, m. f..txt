0902.0301	optical and x-ray observations of m31n 2007-12b: an extragalactic  recurrent nova with a detected progenitor?	we report combined optical and x-ray observations of nova m31n 2007-12b.optical spectroscopy obtained 5 days after the 2007 december outburst showsevidence of very high ejection velocities (fwhm h$\alpha \simeq 4500$ kms$^{-1}$). in addition, swift x-ray data show that m31n 2007-12b is associatedwith a super-soft source (sss) which appeared between 21 and 35 dayspost-outburst and turned off between then and day 169. our analysis impliesthat $m_{\rm wd} \ga 1.3 $m$_{\odot}$ in this system. the optical light curve,spectrum and x-ray behaviour are consistent with those of a recurrent nova.hubble space telescope observations of the pre-outburst location of m31n2007-12b reveal the presence of a coincident stellar source with magnitude andcolor very similar to the galactic recurrent nova rs ophiuchi at quiescence,where the red giant secondary dominates the emission. we believe that this isthe first occasion on which a nova progenitor system has been identified inm31. however, the greatest similarities of outburst optical spectrum and sssbehaviour are with the supposed galactic recurrent nova v2491 cygni. apreviously implied association of m31n 2007-12b with nova m31n 1969-08a isshown to be erroneous and this has important lessons for future searches forrecurrent novae in extragalactic systems. overall, we show that suitablecomplementary x-ray and optical observations can be used not only to identifyrecurrent nova candidates in m31, but also to determine subtypes and importantphysical parameters of these systems. prospects are therefore good forextending studies of recurrent novae into the local group with the potential toexplore in more detail such important topics as their proposed link to type iasupernovae.

0902.2199	swift x-ray and uv monitoring of the classical nova v458 vul (nova vul  2007)	we describe the highly variable x-ray and uv emission of v458 vul (nova vul2007), observed by swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. initiallybright only in the uv, v458 vul became a variable hard x-ray source due tooptically thin thermal emission at kt=0.64 kev with an x-ray band unabsorbedluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. the x-ray spectrum atthis time requires a low fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistentwith a suzaku measurement around the same time. on day 315 we find a new x-rayspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature ofkt=23^{+9}_{-5} ev, while the previous hard x-ray component has declined by afactor of 3.8. the spectrum of this soft x-ray component resembles thosetypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (sss) which suggests that thenova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the wd photosphere is shrinkingto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the x-ray band. we finda high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by anorder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. in the following observations ondays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day397. the hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelationbetween the hard x-ray emission and the uv emission, yielding a spearman rankprobability of 97%. after day 397, the hard component was still present, wasvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not beanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright sss component.

0902.2265	double radio peak and non-thermal collimated ejecta in rs ophiuchi  following the 2006 outburst	we report merlin, vla, ocra-p, vlba, effelsberg and gmrt observationsbeginning 4.5 days after the discovery of rs ophiuchi undergoing its 2006recurrent nova outburst. observations over the first 9 weeks are included,enabling us to follow spectral development throughout the three phases of theremnant development. we see dramatic brightening on days 4 to 7 at 6 ghz and anaccompanying increase in other bands, particularly 1.46 ghz, consistent withtransition from the initial "free expansion" phase to the adiabatic expansionphase. this is complete by day 13 when the flux density at 5 ghz is apparentlydeclining from an unexpectedly early maximum (compared with expectations fromobservations of the 1985 outburst). the flux density recovered to a second peakby approximately day 40, consistent with behaviour observed in 1985. at alltimes the spectral index is consistent with mixed non-thermal and thermalemission. the spectral indices are consistent with a non-thermal component atlower frequencies on all dates, and the spectral index changes show that thetwo components are clearly variable. the estimated extent of the emission at 22ghz on day 59 is consistent with the extended east and west features seen at1.7 ghz with the vlba on day 63 being entirely non-thermal. we suggest atwo-component model, consisting of a decelerating shell seen in mixed thermaland non-thermal emission plus faster bipolar ejecta generating the non-thermalemission, as seen in contemporaneous vlba observations. our estimated ejectamass of 4+/-2x10^{-7} m_\odot is consistent with a wd mass of 1.4 m_\odot. itmay be that this ejecta mass estimate is a lower limit, in which case a lowerwd mass would be consistent with the data.

0706.2745	hubble space telescope imaging of the expanding nebular remnant of the  recurrent nova rs ophiuchi (2006)	we report hubble space telescope imaging obtained 155 days after the 2006outburst of rs ophiuchi. we detect extended emission in both [o iii] and [ne v]lines. in both lines, the remnant has a double ring structure. the e-worientation and total extent of these structures (580+-50 au at d=1.6kpc) isconsistent with that expected due to expansion of emitting regions imagedearlier in the outburst at radio wavelengths. expansion at high velocityappears to have been roughly constant in the e-w direction (v_{exp} = 3200+-300km/s in the plane of the sky), with tentative evidence of deceleration n-s. wepresent a bipolar model of the remnant whose inclination is consistent withthat of the central binary. the true expansion velocities of the polarcomponents are then v = 5600+-1100 km/s. we suggest that the bipolar morphologyof the remnant results from interaction of the outburst ejecta with acircumstellar medium that is significantly denser in the equatorial regions ofthe binary than at the poles. this is also consistent with observations ofshock evolution in the x-ray and the possible presence of dust in the infrared.furthermore, it is in line with models of the shaping of planetary nebulae withclose binary central systems, and also with recent observations relating to theprogenitors of type ia supernovae, for which recurrent novae are a proposedcandidate. our observations also reveal more extended structures to the s and eof the remnant whose possible origin is briefly discussed.

0908.2704	the expanding nebular remnant of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi (2006):  ii. modeling of combined hubble space telescope imaging and ground-based  spectroscopy	we report hubble space telescope imaging, obtained 155 and 449 days after the2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi, together with ground-basedspectroscopic observations, obtained from the observatorio astron\'omiconacional en san pedro m\'artir, baja california, m\'exico and at theobservatorio astrof\'isico guillermo haro, at cananea, sonora, m\'exico. theobservations at the first epoch were used as inputs to model the geometry andkinematic structure of the evolving rs oph nebular remnant. we find that themodeled remnant comprises two distinct co-aligned bipolar components; alow-velocity, high-density innermost (hour glass) region and a more extended,high-velocity (dumbbell) structure. this overall structure is in agreement withthat deduced from radio observations and optical interferometry at earlierepochs. we find that the asymmetry observed in the west lobe is an instrumentaleffect caused by the profile of the hst filter and hence demonstrate that thislobe is approaching the observer. we then conclude that the system has aninclination to the line of sight of 39$^{+1}_{-10}$ degrees. this is inagreement with the inclination of the binary orbit and lends support to theproposal that this morphology is due to the interaction of the outburst ejectawith either an accretion disk around the central white dwarf and/or apre-existing red giant wind that is significantly denser in the equatorialregions of the binary than at the poles. the second epoch hst observation wasalso modeled. however, as no spectra were taken at this epoch, it is moredifficult to constrain any model. nevertheless, we demonstrate that between thetwo hst epochs the outer dumbbell structure seems to have expanded linearly.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

0708.1158	v723 cas (nova cassiopeiae 1995): merlin observations from 1996 to 2001	merlin observations of the unusually slow nova v723 cas are presented. nineepochs of 6-cm data between 1996 and 2001 are mapped, showing the initialexpansion and brightening of the radio remnant, the development of structureand the final decline. a radio light curve is presented and fitted by thestandard hubble flow model for radio emission from novae in order to determinethe values of various physical parameters for the shell. the model isconsistent with the overall development of the radio emission. assuming adistance of 2.39 (+/-0.38) kpc and a shell temperature of 17000 k, the modelyields values for expansion velocity of 414 +/- 0.1 km s^-1 and shell mass of1.13 +/- 0.04 * 10^-4 msolar. these values are consistent with those derivedfrom other observations although the ejected masses are rather higher thantheoretical predictions. the structure of the shell is resolved by merlin andshows that the assumption of spherical symmetry in the standard model isunlikely to be correct.

0708.1216	gmrt observations of the 2006 outburst of the nova rs ophiuchi: first  detection of emission at radio frequencies &lt; 1.4 ghz	the first low radio frequency (&lt;1.4 ghz) detection of the outburst of therecurrent nova rs ophiuchi is presented in this letter. radio emission wasdetected at 0.61 ghz on day 20 with a flux density of ~48 mjy and at 0.325 ghzon day 38 with a flux density of ~ 44 mjy. this is in contrast with the 1985outburst when it was not detected at 0.327 ghz even on day 66. the emission atlow radio frequencies is clearly non-thermal and is well-explained by asynchrotron spectrum of index alpha ~ -0.8 (s propto nu^alpha) sufferingforeground absorption due to the pre-existing, ionized, warm, clumpy red giantwind. the absence of low frequency radio emission in 1985 and the earlierturn-on of the radio flux in the current outburst are interpreted as being dueto higher foreground absorption in 1985 compared to that in 2006, suggestingthat the overlying wind densities in 2006 are only ~30% of those in 1985.

1009.1737	exquisite nova light curves from the solar mass ejection imager (smei)	we present light curves of three classical novae (kt eridani, v598 puppis,v1280 scorpii) and one recurrent nova (rs ophiuchi) derived from data obtainedby the solar mass ejection imager (smei) on board the coriolis satellite. smeiprovides near complete sky-map coverage with precision visible-light photometryat 102-minute cadence. the light curves derived from these sky maps offerunprecedented temporal resolution around, and especially before, maximum light,a phase of the nova eruption normally not covered by ground-based observations.they allow us to explore fundamental parameters of individual objects includingthe epoch of the initial explosion, the reality and duration of any pre-maximumhalt (found in all three fast novae in our sample), the presence of secondarymaxima, speed of decline of the initial light curve, plus precise timing of theonset of dust formation (in v1280 sco) leading to estimation of the bolometricluminosity, white dwarf mass and object distance. for kt eri, liverpooltelescope skycamt data confirm important features of the smei light curve andoverall our results add weight to the proposed similarities of this object torecurrent rather than to classical novae. in rs oph, comparison with hard x-raydata from the 2006 outburst implies that the onset of the outburst coincideswith extensive high velocity mass-loss. it is also noted that two of the fournovae we have detected (v598 pup and kt eri) were only discovered byground-based observers weeks or months after maximum light, yet these novaereached peak magnitudes of 3.46 and 5.42 respectively. this emphasizes the factthat many bright novae per year are still overlooked, particularly those of thevery fast speed class. coupled with its ability to observe novae in detail evenwhen relatively close to the sun in the sky, we estimate that as many as 5novae per year may be detectable by smei.

1011.2045	the morphology of the expanding ejecta of v2491 cygni (2008 n.2)	determining the evolution of the ejecta morphology of novae provides valuableinformation on the shaping mechanisms in operation at early stages of the novaoutburst. understanding such mechanisms has implications for studies of shapingfor example in proto-planetary nebulae. here we perform morpho-kinematicalstudies of v2491 cyg using spectral data to determine the likely structure ofthe ejecta and its relationship to the central system and shaping mechanisms.we use shape to model different morphologies and retrieve their spectra. thesesynthetic spectra are compared with observed spectra to determine the mostlikely morphology giving rise to them, including system inclination andexpansion velocity of the nova ejecta. we find the best fit remnant morphologyto be that of polar blobs and an equatorial ring with an implied inclination of80$^{+3}_{-12}$ degrees and an maximum expansion velocity of the polar blobs of3100$^{+200}_{-100}$ km/s and for the equatorial ring 2700$^{+200}_{-100}$km/s. this inclination would suggest that we should observe eclipses which willenable us to determine more precisely important parameters of the centralbinary. we also note that the amplitude of the outburst is more akin to thefound in recurrent nova systems.

1011.5988	a spitzer survey of novae in m31	we report the results of the first infrared survey of novae in the nearbyspiral galaxy, m31. both photometric and spectroscopic observations of a sampleof 10 novae (m31n 2006-09c, 2006-10a, 2006-10b, 2006-11a, 2007-07f, 2007-08a,2007-08d, 2007-10a, 2007-11d, and 2007-11e) were obtained with the spitzerspace telescope. eight of the novae were observed with the irac (all but m31n2007-11d and 2007-11e) and eight with the irs (all but 2007-07f and 2007-08a),resulting in six in common between the two instruments. the observations, whichwere obtained between ~3 and ~7 months after discovery, revealed evidence fordust formation in two of the novae: m31n 2006-10a and (possibly) 2007-07f, and[ne ii] 12.8 micron line emission in a third (2007-11e). the spitzerobservations were supplemented with ground-based optical photometric andspectroscopic data that were used to determine the speed classes andspectroscopic types of the novae in our survey. after including data fordust-forming galactic novae, we show that dust formation timescales arecorrelated with nova speed class in that dust typically forms earlier in fasternovae. we conclude that our failure to detect the signature of dust formationin most of our m31 sample is likely a result of the relatively long delaybetween nova eruption and our spitzer observations. indeed, the two novae forwhich we found evidence of dust formation were the two "slowest" novae in oursample. finally, as expected, we found that the majority of the novae in oursample belong to the fe ii spectroscopic class, with only one clear example ofthe he/n class (m31n 2006-10b). typical of an he/n system, m31n 2006-10b wasthe fastest nova in our sample, not detected with the irs, and just barelydetected in three of the irac bands when it was observed ~4 months aftereruption.

1104.3068	a very luminous, highly extinguished, very fast nova - v1721 aquilae	fast novae are primarily located within the plane of the galaxy, slow novaeare found within its bulge. because of high interstellar extinction along theline of sight many novae lying close to the plane are missed and only thebrightest seen. one nova lying very close to the galactic plane is v1721aquilae, discovered in outburst on 2008 september 22. spectra obtained 2.69days after outburst revealed very high expansion velocities (fwhm ~6450 km/s).in this paper we have used available pre- and post-outburst photometry andpost-outburst spectroscopy to conclude that the object is a very fast,luminous, and highly extinguished a_v=11.6+/-0.2) nova system with an averageejection velocity of ~3400 km/s. pre-outburst near-ir colours from 2massindicate that at quiescence the object is similar to many quiescent cne andappears to have a main sequence/sub-giant secondary rather than a giant. basedon the speed of decline of the nova and its emission line profiles wehypothesise that the axis ratio of the nova ejecta is ~1.4 and that itsinclination is such that the central binary accretion disc is face-on to theobserver. the accretion disc's blue contribution to the system's near-irquiescent colours may be significant. simple models of the nova ejecta havebeen constructed using the morphological modelling code xs5, and the resultssupport the above hypothesis. spectral classification of this object has beendifficult owing to low s/n levels and high extinction, which has eliminated allevidence of any he/n or feii emission within the spectra. we suggest twopossibilities for the nature of v1721 aql: that it is a u sco type rn with asub-giant secondary or, less likely, that it is a highly energetic bright andfast classical nova with a main sequence secondary. future monitoring of theobject for possible rn episodes may be worthwhile, as would archival searchesfor previous outbursts.

1104.3482	on the progenitor system of nova v2491 cygni	nova v2491 cyg is one of just two detected pre-outburst in x-rays. the lightcurve of this nova exhibited a rare "re-brightening" which has been attributedby some as the system being a polar, whilst others claim that a magnetic wd isunlikely. by virtue of the nature of x-ray and spectroscopic observations thesystem has been proposed as a recurrent nova, however the adoption of a 0.1 dayorbital period is generally seen as incompatible with such a system. in thisresearch note we address the nature of the progenitor system and the source ofthe 0.1 day periodicity. through the combination of liverpool telescopeobservations with published data and archival 2mass data we show that v2491cyg, at a distance of 10.5 - 14 kpc, is likely to be a recurrent nova of the usco-class; containing a sub-giant secondary and an accretion disk, rather thanaccretion directly onto the poles. we show that there is little evidence, atquiescence, supporting a ~ 0.1 day periodicity, the variation seen at thisstage is likely caused by flickering of a re-established accretion disk. wepropose that the periodicity seen shortly after outburst is more likely relatedto the outburst rather than the - then obscured - binary system. finally weaddress the distance to the system, and show that a significantly lowerdistance (~ 2 kpc) would result in a severely under-luminous outburst, and assuch favour the larger distance and the recurrent nova scenario.

1204.4850	on the spectroscopic classes of novae in m33	we report the initial results from an ongoing multi-year spectroscopic surveyof novae in m33. the survey resulted in the spectroscopic classification of sixnovae (m33n 2006-09a, 2007-09a, 2009-01a, 2010-10a, 2010-11a, and 2011-12a) anda determination of rates of decline (t_2 times) for four of them (2006-09a,2007-09a, 2009-01a, and 2010-10a). when these data are combined with existingspectroscopic data for two additional m33 novae (2003-09a and 2008-02a) we findthat 5 of the 8 novae with available spectroscopic class appear to be membersof either the he/n or fe iib (hybrid) classes, with only two clear members ofthe fe ii spectroscopic class. this initial finding is very different from whatwould be expected based on the results for m31 and the galaxy where fe ii novaedominate, and the he/n and fe iib classes together make up only ~20% of thetotal. it is plausible that the increased fraction of he/n and fe iib novaeobserved in m33 thus far may be the result of the younger stellar populationthat dominates this galaxy, which is expected to produce novae that harborgenerally more massive white dwarfs than those typically associated with novaein m31 or the milky way.

1207.5301	the expanding dusty bipolar nebula around the nova v1280 sco	v1280 sco is one of the slowest dust-forming nova ever historically observed.we performed multi-epoch high-spatial resolution observations of thecircumstellar dusty environment of v1280 sco to investigate the level ofasymmetry of the ejecta we observed v1280 sco in 2009, 2010 and 2011 usingunprecedented high angular resolution techniques. we used the naco/vlt adaptiveoptics system in the j, h and k bands, together with contemporaneous visir/vltmid-ir imaging that resolved the dust envelope of v1280 sco, and sinfoni/vltobservations secured in 2011. we report the discovery of a dustyhourglass-shaped bipolar nebula. the apparent size of the nebula increased from0.30" x 0.17" in july 2009 to 0.64" x 0.42" in july 2011. the aspect ratiosuggests that the source is seen at high inclination. the central source shinesefficiently in the k band and represents more than 56+/-5% of the total flux in2009, and 87+/-6% in 2011. a mean expansion rate of 0.39+/-0.03 mas per day isinferred from the visir observations in the direction of the major axis, whichrepresents a projected upper limit. assuming that the dust shell expands inthat direction as fast as the low-excitation slow ejecta detected inspectroscopy, this yields a lower limit distance to v1280 sco of 1kpc; however,the systematic errors remain large due to the complex shape and velocity fieldof the dusty ejecta. the dust seems to reside essentially in the polar caps andno infrared flux is detected in the equatorial regions in the latest dataset.this may imply that the mass-loss was dominantly polar.

1209.2431	an hi shell-like structure associated with nova v458 vulpeculae?	we report the radio detection of a shell-like hi structure in proximity to,and probably associated with, the nova v458 vul. high spectral resolutionobservation with the giant metrewave radio telescope has made it possible tostudy the detailed kinematics of this broken and expanding shell. unlike thediffuse galactic hi emission, this is a single velocity component emission withsignificant clumping at ~ 0.5' scales. the observed narrow line width of ~ 5km/s suggests that the shell consists of mostly cold gas. assuming a distanceof 13 kpc to the system, as quoted in the literature, the estimated hi mass ofthe nebula is about 25 m_sun. however, there are some indications that thesystem is closer than 13 kpc. if there is a physical association of the histructure and the nova system, the asymmetric morphology and the off-centredstellar system indicates past strong interaction of the mass loss in theasymptotic giant branch phase with the surrounding interstellar medium. so far,this is the second example, after gk per, of a large hi structure associatedwith a classical nova.

1303.1980	on the m31 nova progenitor population	we present a survey of m31 novae in quiescence. this is the first catalogueof extragalactic systems in quiescence and contains 37 spectroscopicallyconfirmed novae from 2006 to 2013. we used liverpool telescope and faulkestelescope north images taken during outburst to identify accurate positions foreach system. these positions were then transformed to archival hubble spacetelescope (hst) images and we performed photometry on any resolvable sourcethat was consistent with the transformed positions. as red giants in m31 willbe resolvable in the hst images, we can detect systems with red giantsecondaries. there are only a few confirmed examples of such systems in ourgalaxy (e.g. rs oph and t crb). however, we find a much higher portion of thenova population in m31 may contain red giant secondaries. for some novae,coincident hst images had been taken when the nova was still fading, allowingus to produce light curves that go fainter than is possible to achieve for mostextragalactic systems. finally, we compare the m31 and galactic quiescent novapopulations.

0801.2162	artemis (automated robotic terrestrial exoplanet microlensing search) -  a possible expert-system based cooperative effort to hunt for planets of  earth mass and below	(abridged) the technique of gravitational microlensing is currently unique inits ability to provide a sample of terrestrial exoplanets around both galacticdisk and bulge stars, allowing to measure their abundance and determine theirdistribution with respect to mass and orbital separation. in order to achievethese goals in reasonable time, a well-coordinated effort involving a networkof either 2m or 4 x 1m telescopes at each site is required. it could lead tothe first detection of an earth-mass planet outside the solar system, and evenplanets less massive than earth could be discovered. from april 2008, artemis(automated robotic terrestrial exoplanet microlensing search) is planned toprovide a platform for a three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomalymonitoring. as an expert system embedded in estar (e-science telescopes forastronomical research), artemis will give advice on the optimal targets to beobserved at any given time, and will also alert on deviations from ordinarymicrolensing light curves by means of the signalmen anomaly detector. while theuse of the voevent (virtual observatory event) protocol allows a directinteraction with the telescopes that are part of the htn (heterogeneoustelescope networks) consortium, additional interfaces provide means ofcommunication with all existing microlensing campaigns that rely on humanobservers. the success of discovering a planet by microlensing criticallydepends on the availability of a telescope in a suitable location at the righttime, which can mean within 10 min. real-time modelling offers the opportunityof live discovery of extra-solar planets, thereby providing ''science live toyour home''.

1309.2604	obscuration effects in super-soft-source x-ray spectra	super-soft-source (sss) x-ray spectra are blackbody-like spectra witheffective temperatures ~3-7x10^5 k and luminosities of 10^{35-38} erg/s. sssgrating spectra display atmospheric absorption lines. radiation transportatmosphere models can be used to derive physical parameters, but moresophisticated models are required. we bypass the complications of spectralmodels and concentrate on the data in a comparative, qualitative study. weinspect all available x-ray grating sss spectra to determine systematic,model-independent trends. we use comparative plots of spectra of differentsystems to find common and different features. the results are interpreted inthe context of system parameters obtained from the literature. we find twodistinct types of sss spectra which we name ssa and sse. their mainobservational characteristics are either clearly visible absorption lines oremission lines, respectively, while both types contain atmospheric continuumemission. sse may be obscured ssa systems, which is supported by similaritiesbetween sse and ssa with obscured and unobscured agn, respectively. further, wefind all known or suspected high-inclination systems to emit permanently in ansse state. some sources are found to transition between ssa and sse states,becoming sse when fainter. sss spectra are subject to various occultationprocesses. in cal 87, the accretion disc blocks the central hot source whenviewed edge on. in novae, the accretion disc may have been destroyed during theinitial explosion but could have reformed by the time of the sss phase. inaddition, clumpy ejecta may lead to temporary obscuration events. the emissionlines originate from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc, its wind orfurther out in clumpy ejecta while thomson scattering allows continuum emissionto be visible also during total obscuration of the central hot source.

1310.0949	rapid dust formation in novae: the speed class - formation timescale  correlation explained	observations show that the time of onset of dust formation in classical novaedepends strongly on their speed class, with dust typically taking longer toform in slower novae. using empirical relationships between speed class,luminosity and ejection velocity, it can be shown that dust formation timescaleis expected to be essentially independent of speed class. however, following anova outburst the spectrum of the central hot source evolves, with anincreasing proportion of the radiation being emitted short-ward of the lymanlimit. the rate at which the spectrum evolves also depends on the speed class.we have therefore refined the simple model by assuming photons at energieshigher than the lyman limit are absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas internal tothe dust formation sites, therefore preventing these photons reaching thenucleation sites. with this refinement the dust formation timescale istheoretically dependent on speed class and the results of our theoreticalmodification agree well with the observational data. we consider two types ofcarbon-based dust, graphite and amorphous carbon, with both types producingsimilar relationships. our results can be used to predict when dust will formin a nova of a given speed class and hence when observations should optimallybe taken to detect the onset of dust formation.

0705.0701	the early spectrophotometric evolution of v1186 scorpii (nova scorpii  2004 #1)	we report optical photometry and optical through mid-infrared spectroscopy ofthe classical nova v1186 sco. this slowly developing nova had an complex lightcurve with multiple secondary peaks similar to those seen in pw vul. the timeto decline 2 magnitudes, t$_2$, was 20 days but the erratic nature of the lightcurve makes determination of intrinsic properties based on the decline time(e.g., luminosity) problematic, and the often cited mmrd relationship of dellavalle and livio (1995) fails to yield a plausible distance. spectra covering0.35 to 35 $\mu$m were obtained in two separate epochs during the first year ofoutburst. the first set of spectra, taken about 2 months after visible maximum,are typical of a co-type nova with narrow line emission from \ion{h}{1},\ion{fe}{2}, \ion{o}{1} and \ion{he}{1}. later data, obtained between 260 and380 days after maximum, reveal an emerging nebular spectrum. \textit{spitzer}spectra show weakening hydrogen recombination emission with the emergence of[\ion{ne}{2}] (12.81 $\mu$m) as the strongest line. strong emission from[\ion{ne}{3}] (15.56 $\mu$m) is also detected. photoionization models with loweffective temperature sources and only marginal neon enhancement (ne $\sim$ 1.3ne$_{\odot}$) are consistent with these ir fine-structure neon lines indicatingthat v1186 sco did not occur on a onemg white dwarf. in contrast, the slow anderratic light curve evolution, spectral development, and photoionizationanalysis of the ejecta imply the outburst occurred on a low mass co whitedwarf. we note that this is the first time strong [\ion{ne}{2}] lines have beendetected so early in the outburst of a co nova and suggests that the presenceof mid-infrared neon lines is not directly indicative of a onemg nova event.

1401.2904	a remarkable recurrent nova in m31 - the x-ray observations	another outburst of the recurrent m31 nova m31n 2008-12a was announced inlate november 2013. optical data suggest an unprecedentedly short recurrencetime of approximately one year. in this letter we address the x-ray propertiesof m31n 2008-12a. we requested swift monitoring observations shortly after theoptical discovery. we estimated source count rates and extracted x-ray spectrafrom the resulting data. the corresponding ultraviolet (uv) data was alsoanalysed. m31n 2008-12a was clearly detected as a bright supersoft x-ray source(sss) only six days after the well-constrained optical discovery. it displayeda short sss phase of two weeks duration and an exceptionally hot x-ray spectrumwith an effective blackbody temperature of ~97 ev. during the sss phase thex-ray light curve displayed significant variability that might have beenaccompanied by spectral variations. the very early x-ray variability was foundto be anti-correlated with simultaneous variations in the uv flux. the x-rayproperties of m31n 2008-12a coherently point towards a high-mass white dwarf inthe nova system. this object might be a promising type ia supernova progenitor.we re-discovered additional x-ray detections of m31n 2008-12a that areconsistent with our data and increase the number of known nova outbursts toseven. this nova is an exceptional object that merits further attention in thefuture.

1402.1109	the detailed photometric and spectroscopic study of the 2011 outburst of  the recurrent nova t pyxidis from 0.8 to 250 days after discovery	we investigated the optical lightcurve of t pyx during its 2011 outburst bycompiling a database of smei and aavso observations. the smei lightcurve,providing unprecedented detail covering 1.5-49d post-discovery, was dividedinto four phases based on the idealised cn optical lightcurve; the initial rise(1.5-3.3d), the pre-maximum halt (3.3-13.3d), the final rise (14.7-27.9d), andthe early decline (27.9d-). the smei lightcurve contains a strongly detectedperiod of 1.44+/-0.05d during the pre-maximum phase. these oscillationsresemble those found in tnr models arising from instabilities in the expandingenvelope. no spectral variation mirroring the lightcurve periodicity was found.a marked dip at 22-24d just before maximum light (27.9d) may represent the samephenomenon seen in novae observed by smei. spectra from the liverpool telescopeand smarts 1.5m were obtained from 0.8-80.7 and 155.1-249.9d, covering themajor phases of development. a distinct high velocity ejection phase wasevident during the early rise (v~4000 km/s). a marked drop at 5.7d, and then agradual increase occurred in the ejection velocity which stabilised at ~1500km/s at the pre-maximum halt. here we propose two stages of mass loss, ashort-lived phase occurring immediately after outburst, lasting ~6d, followedby a steadily evolving and higher mass loss phase. the overall spectraldevelopment follows that typical of a cn and comparison with the photometricbehaviour reveals consistencies with the evolving pseudo-photosphere model of acn outburst. comparing optical spectra to x-ray and radio lightcurves, weak [fex] 6375 angstrom emission was marginally detected before the x-ray rise and wasclearly present during the brightest phase of x-ray emission. if the onset ofthe x-ray phase and the start of the optical final decline are related to thecessation of significant mass loss, then this occurred at 90-110d.

1405.4874	on the progenitors of local group novae - i. the m31 catalog	we report the results of a survey of m31 novae in quiescence. this is thefirst catalog of extragalactic systems in quiescence to be published, andcontains data for 38 spectroscopically confirmed novae from 2006 to 2012. weused liverpool telescope (lt) images of each nova during eruption to define anaccurate position for each system. these positions were then matched toarchival hubble space telescope (hst) images and we performed photometry on anyresolved objects that were coincident with the eruption positions. the surveyaimed to detect quiescent systems with red giant secondaries, as only these,along with a few systems with bright sub-giant secondaries, will be resolvablein the hst images. there are only a few confirmed examples of such red giantnovae in our galaxy, the majority of which are recurrent novae. however, wefind a relatively high percentage of the nova eruptions in m31 may occur insystems containing red giant secondaries. of the 38 systems in this catalog, 11have a progenitor candidate whose probability of being a coincidental alignmentis less than 5%. we show that, at the 3 sigma limit, up to only two of theseeleven systems may be due to chance alignments, leading to an estimate of them31 nova population with evolved secondaries of up to 24%, compared to the ~3%seen galactically. such an elevated proportion of nova systems with evolvedsecondaries may imply the presence of a much larger population of recurrentnovae than previously thought. this would have considerable impact,particularly with regards their potential as type ia supernova progenitors.

1407.2935	radio frequency models of novae in eruption. i. the free-free process in  bipolar morphologies	observations of novae at radio frequencies provide us with a measure of thetotal ejected mass, density profile and kinetic energy of a nova eruption. theradio emission is typically well characterized by the free-free emissionprocess. most models to date have assumed spherical symmetry for the eruption,although it has been known for as long as there have been radio observations ofthese systems, that spherical eruptions are to simplistic a geometry. in thispaper, we build bipolar models of the nova eruption, assuming the free-freeprocess, and show the effects of varying different parameters on the radiolight curves. the parameters considered include the ratio of the minor- tomajor-axis, the inclination angle and shell thickness (further parameters areprovided in the appendix). we also show the uncertainty introduced when fittingspherical model synthetic light curves to bipolar model synthetic light curves.we find that the optically thick phase rises with the same power law ($s_{\nu}\propto t^2$) for both the spherical and bipolar models. in the bipolar casethere is a "plateau" phase -- depending on the thickness of the shell as wellas the ratio of the minor- to major-axis -- before the final decline, thatfollows the same power law ($s_{\nu} \propto t^{-3}$) as in the spherical case.finally, fitting spherical models to the bipolar model synthetic light curvesrequires, in the worst case scenario, doubling the ejected mass, more thanhalving the electron temperature and reducing the shell thickness by nearly afactor of 10. this implies that in some systems we have been over predictingthe ejected masses and under predicting the electron temperature of the ejecta.

1506.04202	a remarkable recurrent nova in m31: discovery and optical/uv  observations of the predicted 2014 eruption	the andromeda galaxy recurrent nova m31n 2008-12a had been caught in eruptioneight times. the inter-eruption period of m31n 2008-12a is ~1 year, making itthe most rapidly recurring system known, and a strong single-degenerate type iasupernova progenitor candidate. following the 2013 eruption, a campaign wasinitiated to detect the predicted 2014 eruption and to then perform highcadence optical photometric and spectroscopic monitoring using ground-basedtelescopes, along with rapid uv and x-ray follow-up with the swift satellite.here we report the results of a high cadence multicolour optical monitoringcampaign, the spectroscopic evolution, and the uv photometry. we also discusstantalising evidence of a potentially related, vastly-extended, nebulosity. the2014 eruption was discovered, before optical maximum, on october 2, 2014. wefind that the optical properties of m31n 2008-12a evolve faster than allgalactic recurrent novae known, and all its eruptions show remarkablesimilarity both photometrically and spectroscopically. optical spectra wereobtained as early as 0.26 days post maximum, and again confirm the nova natureof the eruption. a significant deceleration of the inferred ejecta expansionvelocity is observed which may be caused by interaction of the ejecta withsurrounding material, possibly a red giant wind. we find a low ejected mass andlow ejection velocity, which are consistent with high mass-accretion rate, highmass white dwarf, and short recurrence time models of novae. we encourageadditional observations, especially around the predicted time of the nexteruption, towards the end of 2015.

1509.04004	swift detection of the super-swift switch-on of the super-soft phase in  nova v745 sco (2014)	v745 sco is a recurrent nova, with the most recent eruption occurring infebruary 2014. v745 sco was first observed by swift a mere 3.7 hr after theannouncement of the optical discovery, with the super-soft x-ray emission beingdetected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it boththe fastest follow-up of a nova by swift and the earliest switch-on ofsuper-soft emission yet detected. such an early switch-on time suggests acombination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, togetherwith the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a highmass white dwarf (&gt;1.3 m_sun). the x-ray spectral evolution was followed froman early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of thesuper-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorptionedges and thermal continuum temperature. uv grism data were also obtainedthroughout the super-soft interval, with the spectra showing mainly emissionlines from lower ionization transitions and the balmer continuum in emission.v745 sco is compared with both v2491 cyg (another nova with a very shortsuper-soft phase) and m31n 2008-12a (the most rapidly recurring nova yetdiscovered). the longer recurrence time compared to m31n 2008-12a could be dueto a lower mass accretion rate, although inclination of the system may alsoplay a part. nova v745 sco (2014) revealed the fastest evolving super-softsource phase yet discovered, providing a detailed and informative dataset forstudy.

1512.04088	on the progenitors of local group novae. ii. the red giant nova rate of  m31	in our preceding paper, liverpool telescope data of m31 novae in eruptionwere used to facilitate a search for their progenitor systems within archivalhubble space telescope (hst) data, with the aim of detecting systems with redgiant secondaries (rg-novae) or luminous accretion disks. from an input catalogof 38 spectroscopically confirmed novae with archival quiescent observations,likely progenitors were recovered for eleven systems. here we present theresults of the subsequent statistical analysis of the original survey,including possible biases associated with the survey and the m31 novapopulation in general. as part of this analysis we examine the distribution ofoptical decline times (t(2)) of m31 novae, how the likely bulge and disk novadistributions compare, and how the m31 t(2) distribution compares to that ofthe milky way. using a detailed monte carlo simulation, we determine that 30(+13/-10) percent of all m31 nova eruptions can be attributed to rg-novasystems, and at the 99 percent confidence level, &gt;10 percent of all m31 novaeare rg-novae. this is the first estimate of a rg-nova rate of an entire galaxy.our results also imply that rg-novae in m31 are more likely to be associatedwith the m31 disk population than the bulge, indeed the results are consistentwith all rg-novae residing in the disk. if this result is confirmed in othergalaxies, it suggests any type ia supernovae that originate from rg-novasystems are more likely to be associated with younger populations, and may berare in old stellar populations, such as early-type galaxies.

0807.3817	rotational velocities of the giants in symbiotic stars: iii. evidence of  fast rotation in s-type symbiotics	we have measured the projected rotational velocities (vsini) in a number ofsymbiotic stars and m giants using high resolution spectroscopic observations.on the basis of our measurements and data from the literature, we compare therotation of mass-donors in symbiotics with vsini of field giants and find that:  (1) the k giants in s-type symbiotics rotate at vsini&gt;4.5 km/s, which is 2-4times faster than the field k giants;  (2) the m giants in s-type symbiotics rotate on average 1.5 times faster thanthe field m giants. statistical tests show that these differences are highlysignificant: p-value &lt; 0.001 in the spectral type bins k2iii-k5iii,m0iii-m6iii, and m2iii-m5iii;  (3) our new observations of d'-type symbiotics also confirm that they arefast rotators.  as a result of the rapid rotation, the cool giants in symbiotics should have3-30 times larger mass loss rates. our results suggest also that bipolarejections in symbiotics seem to happen in objects where the mass donors rotatefaster than the orbital period.  all spectra used in our series of papers can be obtained upon request fromthe authors.

astro-ph;0611732	the circumburst environment of a fred grb: study of the prompt emission  and x-ray/optical afterglow of grb 051111	we report a multi-wavelength analysis of the prompt emission and earlyafterglow of grb051111 and discuss its properties in the context of currentfireball models. the detection of grb051111 by the burst alert telescopeon-board swift triggered early bvri' observations with the 2-m robotic faulkestelescope north in hawaii, as well as x-ray observations with the swift x-raytelescope. the prompt gamma-ray emission shows a classical fred profile. theoptical afterglow light curves are fitted with a broken power law, withalpha_1=0.35 to alpha_2=1.35 and a break time around 12 minutes after the grb.although contemporaneous x-ray observations were not taken, a power lawconnection between the gamma-ray tail of the fred temporal profile and the latexrt flux decay is feasible. alternatively, if the x-ray afterglow tracks theoptical decay, this would represent one of the first grbs for which thecanonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early x-ray afterglows has beenmonitored optically. we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsicextinction, elemental abundances and spectral energy distribution. from theabsorption measured in the low x-ray band we find possible evidence for anoverabundance of some alpha elements such as oxygen, [o/zn]=0.7+/-0.3, or,alternatively, for a significant presence of molecular gas. the ir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution measured at 80 minutes after the burst isconsistent with the cooling break lying between the optical and x-ray bands.extensive modelling of the intrinsic extinction suggests dust with big grainsor grey extinction profiles. the early optical break is due either to an energyinjection episode or, less probably, to a stratified wind environment for thecircumburst medium.

astro-ph;0701087	the prompt to late-time multiwavelength analysis of grb 060210	we present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric &amp; spectroscopicobservations of grb 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context ofcurrent grb models. all available optical data underwent a simultaneoustemporal fit, while x-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &amp;spectrally. the results were compared to each other and to possible grb models.the x-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with abreak at 7.4 hours. the late optical afterglow has a well constrained singlepower-law index which has a value between the two x-ray indices, though it doesagree with a single power-law fit to the x-ray. an evolution of the hardness ofthe high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinctionfrom a comparison of the extrapolated x-ray flux to that measured in theoptical. we find that the flaring gamma-ray and x-ray emission is likely due tointernal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to theexternal shock. the late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break betweenthe optical and x-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time ofthe break. the required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while atthe high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.

0810.2023	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the evolving shock in the 2006  outburst of rs ophiuchi	the evolution of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi wasfollowed with 12 x-ray grating observations with chandra and xmm-newton. wepresent detailed spectral analyses using two independent approaches. from thebest dataset, taken on day 13.8 after outburst, we reconstruct the temperaturedistribution and derive elemental abundances. we find evidence for at least twodistinct temperature components on day 13.8 and a reduction of temperature withtime. the x-ray flux decreases as a power-law, and the power-law index changesfrom -5/3 to -8/3 around day 70 after outburst. this can be explained bydifferent decay mechanisms for the hot and cool components. the decay of thehot component and the decrease in temperature are consistent with radiativecooling, while the decay of the cool component can be explained by theexpansion of the ejecta. we find overabundances of n and of alpha-elements,which could either represent the composition of the secondary that provides theaccreted material or that of the ejecta. the n overabundance indicatescno-cycled material. from comparisons to abundances for the secondary takenfrom the literature, we conclude that 20-40% of the observed nitrogen couldoriginate from the outburst. the overabundance of the alpha-elements is nottypical for stars of the spectral type of the secondary in the rs oph system,and white dwarf material might have been mixed into the ejecta. however, nodirect measurements of the alpha-elements in the secondary are available, andthe continuous accretion may have changed the observable surface composition.
