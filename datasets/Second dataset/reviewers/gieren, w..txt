0905.4540	high resolution spectroscopy for cepheids distance determination. v.  impact of the cross-correlation method on the p-factor and the  gamma-velocities	the cross correlation method (hereafter cc) is widely used to derive theradial velocity curve of cepheids when the signal to noise of the spectra islow. however, if it is used with the wrong projection factor, it mightintroduce some biases in the baade-wesselink (hereafter bw) methods ofdetermining the distance of cepheids. in addition, it might affect the averagevalue of the radial velocity curve (or gamma-velocity) important for galacticstructure studies. we aim to derive a period-projection factor relation(hereafter pp) appropriate to be used together with the cc method. moreover, weinvestigate whether the cc method can explain the misunderstood previouscalculation of the k-term of cepheids. we observed eight galactic cepheids withthe harps spectrograph. for each star, we derive an interpolated cc radialvelocity curve using the harps pipeline. the amplitudes of these curves areused to determine the correction to be applied to the semi-theoreticalprojection factor derived in nardetto et al. (2007). their average value (orgamma-velocity) are also compared to the center-of-mass velocities derived innardetto et al. (2008). the correction in amplitudes allows us to derive a newpp relation: p = [-0.08+-0.05] log p +[1.31+-0.06]. we also find a negligiblewavelength dependence (over the optical range) of the pp relation. we finallyshow that the gamma-velocity derived from the cc method is systematicallyblue-shifted by about 1.0 +- 0.2km/s compared to the center-of-mass velocity ofthe star. an additional blue-shift of 1.0km/s is thus needed to totally explainthe previous calculation of the k-term of cepheids (around 2km/s). the new pprelation we derived is a solid tool for the distance scale calibration(abridged).

1012.0231	accurate dynamical mass determination of a classical cepheid in an  eclipsing binary system	stellar pulsation theory provides a means of determining the masses ofpulsating classical cepheid supergiant - it is the pulsation that causes theirluminosity to vary. such pulsational masses are found to be smaller than themasses derived from stellar evolution theory: this is the cepheid massdiscrepancy problem, for which a solution is missing. an independent, accuratedynamical mass determination for a classical cepheid variable star (as opposedto type-ii cepheids, low-mass stars with a very different evolutionary history)in a binary system is needed in order to determine which is correct. theaccuracy of previous efforts to establish a dynamical cepheid mass fromgalactic single-lined noneclipsing binaries was typically about 15-30 per cent,which is not good enough to resolve the mass discrepancy problem. in spite ofmany observational efforts, no firm detection of a classical cepheid in aneclipsing double-lined binary has hitherto been reported. here we report thediscovery of a classical cepheid in a well detached, double-lined eclipsingbinary in the large magellanic cloud. we determine the mass to a precision ofone per cent and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass, providing strongevidence that pulsation theory correctly and precisely predicts the masses ofclassical cepheids

1210.6030	pulsation models for the 0.26m_sun star mimicking rr lyrae pulsator.  model survey for the new class of variable stars	we present non-linear hydrodynamic pulsation models for ogle-blg-rrlyr-02792- a 0.26m_sun pulsator, component of the eclipsing binary system, analysedrecently by pietrzynski et al. the star's light and radial velocity curvesmimic that of classical rr lyrae stars, except for the bump in the middle ofthe ascending branch of the radial velocity curve. we show that the bump iscaused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the secondovertone - the same mechanism that causes the hertzsprung bump progression inclassical cepheids. the models allow to constrain the parameters of the star,in particular to estimate its absolute luminosity (approx 33l_sun) andeffective temperature (approx 6970k, close to the blue edge of the instabilitystrip).  we conduct a model survey for the new class of low mass pulsators similar toogle-blg-rrlyr-02792 - products of evolution in the binary systems. we computea grid of models with masses corresponding to half (and less) of the typicalmass of rr lyrae variable, 0.20m_sun&lt;=m&lt;=0.30m_sun, and discuss the propertiesof the resulting light and radial velocity curves. resonant bump progression isclear and may be used to distinguish such stars from classical rr lyrae stars.we present the fourier decomposition parameters for the modelled light andradial velocity curves. the expected values of the phi_31 fourier phase for thelight curves differ significantly from that observed in rr lyrae stars, whichis another discriminant of the new class.

1306.0011	on the form of the spitzer leavitt law and its dependence on metallicity	the form and metallicity-dependence of spitzer mid-infrared cepheid relationsare a source of debate. consequently, spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 um period-magnitudeand period-color diagrams were re-examined via robust routines, thus providingthe reader an alternative interpretation to consider. the relations (nearlymean-magnitude) appear non-linear over an extensive baseline (0.45&lt; logpo&lt;2.0), particularly the period-color trend, which to first-order followsconstant (3.6-4.5) color for shorter-period cepheids and may transition into abluer convex trough at longer-periods. the period-magnitude functions can bedescribed by polynomials (e.g., [3.6 um]=ko-(3.071+-0.059)logpo-(0.120+-0.032)logpo^2), and cepheid distances computed using 3.6 and 4.5um relations agree and the latter provides a first-order consistency check (cosampled at 4.5 um does not seriously compromise those distances). theperiod-magnitude relations appear relatively insensitive to metallicityvariations ([fe/h]~0 to -0.75), a conclusion inferred partly from comparinggalaxy distances established from those relations and ned-d (n&gt;700), yet asolid conclusion awaits comprehensive mid-infrared observations for metal-poorcepheids in ic 1613 ([fe/h] -1). the cepheid-based distances were corrected fordust obscuration using a new ratio (i.e., a(3.6)/e(b-v)=0.18+-0.06) deducedfrom glimpse (spitzer) data.

1412.4834	orbital and physical parameters of eclipsing binaries from the asas  catalogue - viii. the totally-eclipsing double-giant system hd 187669	we present the first full orbital and physical analysis of hd 187669,recognized by the all-sky automated survey (asas) as the eclipsing binary asasj195222-3233.7. we combined multi-band photometry from the asas and superwasppublic archives and 0.41-m prompt robotic telescopes with our high-precisionradial velocities from the harps spectrograph. two different approaches wereused for the analysis: 1) fitting to all data simultaneously with the wd code,and 2) analysing each light curve (with jktebop) and rvs separately andcombining the partial results at the end. this system also shows a totalprimary (deeper) eclipse, lasting for about 6 days. a spectrum obtained duringthis eclipse was used to perform atmospheric analysis with the moog and smecodes in order to constrain physical parameters of the secondary.  we found that asas j195222-3233.7 is a double-lined spectroscopic binarycomposed of two evolved, late-type giants, with masses of $m_1 = 1.504\pm0.004$and $m_2=1.505\pm0.004$ m$_\odot$, and radii of $r_1 = 11.33\pm0.28$ and$r_2=22.62\pm0.50$ r$_\odot$, slightly less metal abundant than the sun, on a$p=88.39$ d orbit. its properties are well reproduced by a 2.38 gyr isochrone,and thanks to the metallicity estimation from the totality spectrum and highprecision in masses, it was possible to constrain the age down to 0.1 gyr. itis the first so evolved galactic eclipsing binary measured with such a goodaccuracy, and as such is a unique benchmark for studying the late stages ofstellar evolution.

1412.8658	discovery of a pair of classical cepheids in an invisible cluster beyond  the galactic bulge	we report the discovery of a pair of extremely reddened classical cepheidvariable stars located in the galactic plane behind the bulge, usingnear-infrared time-series photometry from the vvv survey. this is the firsttime that such objects have ever been found in the opposite side of thegalactic plane. the cepheids have almost identical periods, apparentbrightnesses and colors. from the near-infrared leavitt law, we determine theirdistances with ~1.5% precision and ~8% accuracy. we find that they have a sametotal extinction of a(v)~32 mag, and are located at the same heliocentricdistance of &lt;d&gt;=11.4+/-0.9 kpc, and less than 1 pc from the true galacticplane. their similar periods indicate that the cepheids are also coeval, withan age of ~48+/-3 myr, according to theoretical models. they are separated byan angular distance of only 18.3", corresponding to a projected separation of~1 pc. their position coincides with the expected location of the far 3 kpc armbehind the bulge. such a tight pair of similar classical cepheids indicates thepresence of an underlying young open cluster, that is both hidden behind heavyextinction and disguised by the dense stellar field of the bulge. all ourattempts to directly detect this "invisible cluster" have failed, and deeperobservations are needed.

astro-ph;0601309	the araucaria project. the distance to the local group galaxy ic 1613  from near-infrared photometry of cepheid variables	we have measured accurate near-infrared magnitudes in the j and k bands of 39cepheid variables in ic 1613 with well-determined periods and optical vi lightcurves. using the template light curve approach of soszy{\'n}ski, gieren andpietrzy{\'n}ski, accurate mean magnitudes were obtained from these data whichallowed to determine the distance to ic 1613 relative to the lmc from amultiwavelength period-luminosity solution in the optical vi and near-ir jkbands, with an unprecedented accuracy. our result for the ic 1613 distance is$(m-m)_{0} = 24.291 \pm 0.014$ (random error) mag, with an additionalsystematic uncertainty smaller than 2%. from our multiwavelength approach, wefind for the total (average) reddening to the ic 1613 cepheids $e(b-v) = 0.090\pm 0.007$ mag,which is significantly higher than the foreground reddening ofabout 0.03 mag,showing the presence of appreciable dust extinction inside thegalaxy. our data suggest that the extinction law in ic 1613 is very similar tothe galactic one.our distance result agrees, within the uncertainties, with twoearlier infrared cepheid studies in this galaxy of macri et al. (from hst dataon 4 cepheids), and mcalary et al. (from ground-based h-band photometry of 10cepheids), but our result has reduced the total uncertainty on the distance toic 1613 (relative to the lmc) to less than 3%. with distances to nearbygalaxies from cepheid infrared photometry at this level of accuracy, which arecurrently being obtained in our araucaria project, it seems possible tosignificantly reduce the systematic uncertainty of the hubble constant asderived from the hst key project approach, by improving the calibration of themetallicity effect on pl relation zero points, and by improving the distancedetermination to the lmc.

astro-ph;0601395	the araucaria project. bright variable stars in ngc 6822 from a  wide-field imaging survey	we have performed a search for variable stars in the dwarf irregular galaxyngc 6822 using wide-field multi-epoch vi photometry down to a limitingmagnitude $v$ $\sim$ 22. apart from the cepheid variables in this galaxyalready reported in an earlier paper by pietrzynski et al. (2004), we havefound 1019 "non-periodic" variable stars, 50 periodically variable stars withperiods ranging from 0.12 to 66 days and 146 probably periodic variables.twelve of these stars are eclipsing binaries and fifteen are likely new,low-amplitude cepheids. interestingly, seven of these cepheid candidates haveperiods longer than 100 days, have very low amplitudes (less than 0.2 mag in$i$), and are very red. they could be young, massive cepheids still embedded industy envelopes. the other objects span a huge range in colours and represent amixture of different types of luminous variables. many of the variablesclassified as non-periodic in the present study may turn out to be {\itperiodic} variables once a much longer time baseline will be available to studythem.  we provide the catalogue of photometric parameters and show the atlas oflight curves for the new variable stars. our present catalogue is complementaryto the one of baldacci et al. (2005) which has focussed on very short-periodand fainter variables in a subfield in ngc 6822.

astro-ph;0605226	the araucaria project. a wide-field photometric survey for cepheid  variables in ngc 3109	we have obtained mosaic images of ngc 3109 in the v and i bands on 74 nights,spanning approximately one year. from these data, we have conducted anextensive search for cepheid variables over the entire field of the galaxy,resulting in the discovery of 113 variables with periods ranging from 3.4 to31.4 days. in this sample, 76 cepheids, including many long-period variables,were not known before. for the previously known 45 cepheids in this galaxy, ourdata proved that reported periods were wrong for 14 objects; for nearly allother previously known cepheid variables we were able to significantly improveon the periods. we construct period-luminosity relations from our data andobtain reddening-corrected distance moduli of 25.72 $\pm$ 0.05 mag in v, and25.66 $\pm$ 0.04 mag in i. the distance modulus derived form thereddening-independent v-i wesenheit index turns out to be significantly shorter(25.54 $\pm$ 0.05 mag), which indicates that in addition to the foregroundextinction of e(b-v) = 0.05 mag, there is an intrinsic to ngc 3109 redening ofabout 0.05 mag. our distance obtained based on the reddening-free wesenheitmagnitudes is consistent with earlier distance determinations of ngc 3109 fromcepheids, and the tip of the red giant branch. we will improve on our distanceand extinction determination combining our optical data with the follow-upnear-infrared observations of a subsample of ngc 3109 cepheids.

astro-ph;0605231	the araucaria project. an accurate distance to the local group galaxy  ngc 6822 from near-infrared photometry of cepheid variables	we have measured near-infrared magnitudes in the j and k bands for 56 cepheidvariables in the local group galaxy ngc 6822 with well-determined periods andoptical light curves in the v and i bands. using the template light curveapproach of soszynski, gieren and pietrzynski, accurate mean magnitudes wereobtained from these data which allowed us to determine with unprecedentedaccuracy the distance to ngc 6822 from a multi-wavelength period-luminositysolution in the vijk bands. from our data, we obtain a distance to ngc 6822 of(m-m)_{0} = 23.312 +- 0.021 (random error) mag, with an additional systematicuncertainty of about 3 %. this distance value is tied to an assumed lmcdistance modulus of 18.50. from our multiwavelength approach, we find for thetotal (average) reddening to the ngc 6822 cepheids e(b-v) = 0.356 +- 0.013 mag,which is in excellent agreement with a previous determination of mcgonegal etal. from near-infrared photometry and implies significant internal reddening ofthe cepheids in ngc 6822. our present, definitive distance determination of ngc6822 from cepheids agrees within 2 % with the previous distance we had derivedfrom optical photometry alone, but has significantly reduced error bars.  our cepheid distance to ngc 6822 is in excellent agreement with the recentindependent determination of cioni and habing from the i-band magnitude of thetip of the red giant branch. it also agrees well, within the errors, with theearly determination of mcgonegal et al. (1983) from random-phase h-bandphotometry of nine cepheids.

astro-ph;0605243	the araucaria project: distance to the local group galaxy ngc 3109 from  near-infrared photometry of cepheids	we present near-infrared j- and k-band photometry of 77 cepheid variables inthe local group galaxy ngc 3109. combining our data with the previouslypublished optical v- and i-band photometry of cepheids in this galaxy we derivean accurate distance and interstellar reddening to ngc 3109. adopting adistance modulus of 18.5 mag for the large magellanic cloud, we obtain a truedistance modulus to ngc 3109 of (m-m)_0 = 25.571 +- 0.024 mag (random error),corresponding to a distance of 1.30 +- 0.02 mpc. the systematic uncertainty onthis value (apart from the adopted lmc distance) is of the order of +-3%, themain contributors to this value being the uncertainty on the photometric zeropoints, and the effect of blending with unresolved companion stars. the totalreddening determined from our multiwavelength solution is e(b-v)=0.087 +- 0.012mag. about half of the reddening is produced internal to ngc 3109. our distanceresult is consistent with previous determinations of the distance to ngc 3109,but has significantly reduced error bars.

astro-ph;0610595	the araucaria project. the distance to the sculptor group galaxy ngc 55  from a newly discovered abundant cepheid population	we have detected, for the first time, cepheid variables in the sculptor groupsb(s)m galaxy ngc 55. from wide-field images obtained in the optical v and ibands during 77 nights in 2002-2003, we have found 143 cepheids with periodsranging from 5.6 to 175.9 days. 133 of these objects have periods longer than10 days, making ngc 55 to-date the galaxy with the largest known number oflong-period cepheids in the sculptor group. we construct period-luminosityrelations from our data and obtain distance moduli corrected for the smallforeground reddening to ngc 55 of 26.79 $\pm$ 0.04 mag (internal error) in v,26.66 $\pm$ 0.03 mag in i and 26.40 $\pm$ 0.05 mag in the reddening-independentv-i wesenheit index. the trend of increasing distance moduli with shorterwavelength hints at the existence of significant reddening intrinsic to ngc 55which affects the measured cepheid magnitudes. from our data, we determine theintrinsic mean reddening of the cepheids in ngc 55 as e(b-v) = 0.102 mag whichbrings the distance determinations from the different bands into excellentagreement. our best distance estimate for ngc 55 from the present opticalcepheid photometry is 26.40 mag $\pm$ 0.05 mag (internal error) $\pm$ 0.09 mag(systematic error). this value is tied to an assumed lmc distance of 18.50 mag.our quoted systematic error of the present ngc 55 cepheid distance does nottake into account the current uncertainty on the distance of the fiducial lmcgalaxy itself.  within the small respective uncertainties, the sculptor group galaxies ngc 55and ngc 300 are at the same distance of 1.9 mpc, strengthening the case for aphysical association of these galaxies

astro-ph;0702459	a new neptune-mass planet orbiting hd 219828	two years ago a new benchmark for the planetary survey was set with thediscoveries of three extrasolar planets with masses below 20$m_\oplus$. inparticular, the serendipitous discovery of the 14$m_\oplus$ planet around $\mu$ara found with harps with a semi-amplitude of only 4 m s$^{-1}$ put in evidencethe tremendous potential of harps for the search of this class of very low-massplanets. aiming to discovering new worlds similar to $\mu$ ara b, we carriedout an intensive campaign with harps to observe a selected sample of northernstars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. twostars in our program were found to present radial velocity variationscompatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. the first of these, hd219218, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8$m_\oplus$ and an orbital period of 3.83 days. it is the 11th neptune-massplanet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. the radial velocity dataclearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely ofplanetary mass. the second planet orbits hd 102195, has a mass of 0.45$m_{jup}$and an orbital period of 4.11 days. this planet has been already announced byge et al. (2006). our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found bythese authors. we also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution arecaused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the harpscross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity.an improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. this kind ofanalysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellaractivity induced noise.

astro-ph;9910399	the dwarf nova rz leonis : photometric period, "anti-humps" and normal  alpha disk	we present results of differential photometry of the dwarf nova rz leonisspanning a 11-year baseline. the most striking feature of the light curve is anon-coherent periodic hump of variable amplitude. a seasonal time seriesanalysis yields a photometric period of 0.0756(12) d. in addition, lowamplitude fluctuations of the mean magnitude in time scale of months areobserved. we find that the hump's amplitude is anti-correlated with the star'smean magnitude and becomes "negative" (i.e. an absorption feature or"anti-hump") when the system is very faint. secondary humps and "anti-humps"are also observed. the transition from "anti-humps" to fully developed humpsoccurs on a time scale of 70 days. we interprete the observations as a rapidresponse of the accretion disk to the increase of mass transfer rate. in thiscase we deduce a viscosity parameter alpha ~ 0.08, i.e. much larger than oftenclaimed for wz sge-like stars. we note that the secondary star in rz leo isclose to a main-sequence red dwarf and not a brown-dwarf like star as suggestedfor other long cycle-length su uma stars like wz sge and v592 her. our resultsindicate that large amplitude and long cycle length dwarf novae might notnecessarily correspond to objects in the same evolutive stage.
