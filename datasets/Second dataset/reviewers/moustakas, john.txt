0903.3971	astronomical software wants to be free: a manifesto	astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members ofour community. purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasksbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.however, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards arenot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing softwarepublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead tosignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. weidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety ofapproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality ofastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providingbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by openaccess to large survey and simulation datasets. our aim is to open aconversation on how to move forward. we advocate that: (1) the astronomicalcommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facilityconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered asintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication anddata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing andcollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) thatwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and relatedpublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways offunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink ourvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just atechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.

0706.3501	the incidence of highly-obscured star-forming regions in sings galaxies	using the new capabilities of the spitzer space telescope and extensivemultiwavelength data from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings),it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearbygalaxies down to scales equivalent to large hii regions. we are therefore ableto determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions innormal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formationwe miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. employing anew empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selectedstar-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formationon 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. we find that the medianattenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in h-alpha and that there is no evidence for asubstantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.the regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution(a_h-alpha &gt; 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, thoughvery embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lowerluminosities of compact and ultracompact hii regions are almost certainlypresent in greater numbers. the highly-obscured cases in our sample aregenerally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuationbut are not otherwise remarkable. we also find that a majority of the galaxiesshow decreasing radial trends in h-alpha attenuation. the small fraction ofhighly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxiessuggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or breakup of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime ofa typical star-forming region.

0907.1783	the aromatic features in very faint dwarf galaxies	we present optical and mid-infrared photometry of a statistically completesample of 29 very faint dwarf galaxies (m_r &gt; -15 mag) selected from the sdssspectroscopic sample and observed in the mid-infrared with spitzer irac. thissample contains nearby (redshift z&lt;0.005) galaxies three magnitudes fainterthan previously studied samples. we compare our sample with other star-forminggalaxies that have been observed with both irac and sdss. we examine therelationship of the infrared color, sensitive to pah abundance, withstar-formation rates, gas-phase metallicities and radiation hardness, allestimated from optical emission lines. consistent with studies of more luminousdwarfs, we find that the very faint dwarf galaxies show much weaker pahemission than more luminous galaxies with similar specific star-formationrates. unlike more luminous galaxies, we find that the very faint dwarfgalaxies show no significant dependence at all of pah emission onstar-formation rate, metallicity, or radiation hardness, despite the fact thatthe sample spans a significant range in all of these quantities. when the veryfaint dwarfs in our sample are compared with more luminous (m_r ~ -18 mag)dwarfs, we find that pah emission depends on metallicity and radiationhardness. these two parameters are correlated; we look at the pah-metallicityrelation at fixed radiation hardness and the pah-hardness relation at fixedmetallicity. this test shows that the pah emission in dwarf galaxies dependsmost directly on metallicity.

0907.3185	active galactic nuclei and the truncation of star formation in k+a  galaxies	we have searched for active galactic nuclei (agns) in k+a galaxies, usingmultiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the bootes field of the noao deepwide-field survey. the k+a galaxies, which have had their star formationrapidly truncated, are selected via their strong balmer absorption lines andweak h-alpha emission. our sample consists of 24 k+a galaxies selected from6594 0.10&lt;z&lt;0.35 galaxies brighter than i=20 with optical spectroscopy from theagn and galaxy evolution survey. two thirds of the k+a galaxies are likelyongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. galaxymergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we areobserving the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. as expected, theoptical colors of k+a galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoingstar formation and red passive galaxies. however, only 1% of the galaxies withcolors between the red and blue populations are k+a galaxies, and we concludethat the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies must have been unusuallyabrupt (&lt;100 myr). we examined the agn content of k+a galaxies with bothoptical emission-line ratios (bpt diagrams) and chandra x-ray imaging. at leasthalf of all k+a galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of agns, anda third of m_r&lt;-22 k+a galaxies host agns with x-ray luminosities of 10^{42}erg/s. the faintest k+a galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting agns,having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive starsand few x-ray detections. we speculate that two mechanisms may be responsiblefor the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies, with agn feedback onlyplaying a role in m_r&lt;-20.5 galaxies.

0908.0203	dust-corrected star formation rates of galaxies. i. combinations of  h-alpha and infrared tracers	we combine h-alpha emission-line and infrared continuum measurements of twosamples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formationrates (sfrs). we use a simple energy balance based method that has been appliedpreviously to hii regions in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings), and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. wefind that our composite h-alpha+ir based sfrs are in excellent agreement withattenuation-corrected sfrs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over thefull range of sfrs (0.01 -- 80 solar mass per year) and attenuations (0 -- 2.5mag) studied. we find that the combination of h-alpha and total infraredluminosities provides the most robust sfr measurements, but combinations ofh-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micronperform nearly as well. the calibrations differ significantly from thoseobtained for hii regions (calzetti et al. 2007), with the differenceattributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. ourresults are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `ircirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. the samemethodology can be applied to [oii]$\lambda$3727 emission-line measurements,and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of ir fluxeswhen the latter are not available. we assess the precision and systematicreliability of all of these composite methods.

0909.4079	a spectroscopically confirmed excess of 24 micron sources in a super  galaxy group at z=0.37: enhanced dusty star formation relative to the cluster  and field environment	to trace how dust-obscured star formation varies with environment, we comparethe fraction of 24 micron sources in a super galaxy group to the field and arich galaxy cluster at z~0.35. we draw on multi-wavelength observations thatcombine hubble, chandra, and spitzer imaging with extensive opticalspectroscopy (&gt;1800 redshifts) to isolate galaxies in each environment and thusensure a uniform analysis. we focus on the four galaxy groups in supergroup1120-12 that will merge to form a galaxy cluster comparable in mass to coma. wefind that 1) the fraction of supergroup galaxies with sfr(ir)&gt;3 msun/yr is fourtimes higher than in the cluster (32% vs. 7%); 2) the supergroup's infraredluminosity function confirms that it has a higher density of ir memberscompared to the cluster and includes bright ir sources not found in galaxyclusters at z&lt;0.35; and 3) there is a strong trend of decreasing ir fractionwith increasing galaxy density, i.e. an ir-density relation, not observed inthe cluster. these dramatic differences are surprising because the early-typefraction in the supergroup is already as high as in clusters, i.e. thetimescales for morphological transformation cannot be strongly coupled to whenthe star formation is completely quenched. the supergroup has a significantfraction (~17%) of luminous, low-mass, ir members that are outside the groupcores (r&gt;0.5 mpc); once their star formation is quenched, most will evolve intofaint red galaxies. our analysis indicates that the supergroup's 24 micronpopulation also differs from that in the field: 1) despite the supergrouphaving twice the fraction of e/s0s as the field, the fraction of ir galaxies iscomparable in both environments, and 2) the supergroup's ir luminosity functionhas a higher l(ir)* than that previously measured for the field.

0708.0922	star formation in ngc 5194 (m51a). ii. the spatially-resolved star  formation law	we have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (sfr)surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy m51a (ngc 5194),using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). we introduce a new sfr index based on a linearcombination of h-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, thatprovides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and sfr densities over awide range of dust attenuations. the combination of these extinction-correctedsfr densities with aperture synthesis hi and co maps has allowed us to probethe form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2kpc. we find that the resolved sfr vs gas surface density relation is wellrepresented by a schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion tothe disk-averaged schmidt law. we observe a comparably strong correlation ofthe sfr surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but nosignificant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. thebest-fitting slope of the schmidt law varies from n = 1.37 to 1.56, withzeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.we tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling andaveraging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. our data can also befitted by an alternative parametrization of the sfr surface density in terms ofthe ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with aconsiderable dispersion.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1006.5055	stellar populations of elliptical galaxies in the local universe	we study the stellar populations of 1,923 elliptical galaxies at z&lt;0.05selected from the sloan digital sky survey as a function of velocitydispersion, sigma, and environment. we construct average, high signal-to-noisespectra and find the following: (1) lower-sigma galaxies have a bluer opticalcontinuum and stronger (but still weak) emission lines; (2) at fixed sigma,field ellipticals have a slightly bluer stellar continuum, especially atwavelengths \lesssim 4000 \aa, and have stronger (but still weak) emissionlines compared to their group counterparts, although this environmentaldependence is strongest for low-sigma ellipticals. based on lick indicesmeasured from both the individual and average spectra, we find that: (1) at agiven sigma, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker balmerabsorption than their field counterparts, although this environmentaldependence is most pronounced at low sigma; (2) there is no clear environmentaldependence of &lt;fe&gt;, while the alpha-element absorption indices such as mgb areonly slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. an analysis basedon simple stellar populations (ssps) reveals that more massive ellipticalgalaxies are older, more metal-rich and more strongly alpha-enhanced. we alsofind that: (1) the ssp-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, onaverage, ~1 gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect isstrongest at low sigma; (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [fe/h]and are marginally more strongly alpha-enhanced; and (3) there is nosignificant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [z/h]. our resultsare generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in fieldellipticals at low sigma, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet andinfrared observations.

1007.4547	optical spectroscopy and nebular oxygen abundances of the spitzer/sings  galaxies	we present intermediate-resolution optical spectrophotometry of 65 galaxiesobtained in support of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). foreach galaxy we obtain a nuclear, circumnuclear, and semi-integrated opticalspectrum designed to coincide spatially with mid- and far-infrared spectroscopyfrom the spitzer space telescope. we make the reduced, spectrophotometricallycalibrated one-dimensional spectra, as well as measurements of the fluxes andequivalent widths of the strong nebular emission lines, publically available.we use optical emission-line ratios measured on all three spatial scales toclassify the sample into star-forming, active galactic nuclei (agn), andgalaxies with a mixture of star formation and nuclear activity. we find thatthe relative fraction of the sample classified as star-forming versus agn is astrong function of the integrated light enclosed by the spectroscopic aperture.we supplement our observations with a large database of nebular emission-linemeasurements of individual hii regions in the sings galaxies culled from theliterature. we use these ancillary data to conduct a detailed analysis of theradial abundance gradients and average hii-region abundances of a largefraction of the sample. we combine these results with our new integratedspectra to estimate the central and characteristic (globally-averaged)gas-phase oxygen abundances of all 75 sings galaxies. we conclude with anin-depth discussion of the absolute uncertainty in the nebular oxygen abundancescale.

1012.1324	primus: enhanced specific star formation rates in close galaxy pairs	tidal interactions between galaxies can trigger star formation, whichcontributes to the global star formation rate density of the universe and couldbe a factor in the transformation of blue, star-forming galaxies to red,quiescent galaxies over cosmic time. we investigate tidally-triggered starformation in isolated close galaxy pairs drawn from the prism multi-objectsurvey (primus), a low-dispersion prism redshift survey that has measured~120,000 robust galaxy redshifts over 9.1 deg^2 out to z ~ 1. we select asample of galaxies in isolated galaxy pairs at redshifts 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, withno other objects within a projected separation of 300 h^-1 kpc and dz/(1+z) =0.01, and compare them to a control sample of isolated galaxies to test forsystematic differences in their rest-frame fuv-r and nuv-r colors as a proxyfor relative specific sfr. we find that galaxies in r_p &lt; 50 h^-1 kpc pairshave bluer dust-corrected uv-r colors on average than the control galaxies by-0.134 +/- 0.045 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.075 +/- 0.038 magnitudes in nuv-r,corresponding to a ~15-20% increase in ssfr. this indicates an enhancement inssfr due to tidal interactions. we also find that this relative enhancement isgreater for a subset of r_p &lt; 30 h^-1 kpc pair galaxies, for which the averagecolors offsets are -0.193 +/- 0.065 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.159 +/- 0.048magnitudes in nuv-r, corresponding to a ~25-30% increase in ssfr. we test forevolution in the enhancement of tidally-triggered star formation with redshiftacross our sample redshift range and find marginal evidence for a decrease inssfr enhancement from 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 to 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.75. this indicates that achange in enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions in lowdensity environments is not a contributor to the decline in the global starformation rate density across this redshift range.

1012.4010	dust extinction and metallicities of star-forming lyman alpha emitting  galaxies at low redshift	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of 12galex-discovered star-forming lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3.we measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting theirobserved spectra to stellar population models in order to correct forunderlying stellar absorption. we revisit earlier stellar population modelfitting results, finding that excluding now-known agns lowers the typicalstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 myr and ~ 4 x10^9 msol, respectively. we calculate their dust extinction using the balmerdecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of av ~ 0.3 mag, similar tothat seen in many high-redshift laes. comparing the ratio of lyalpha/halpha andthe lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find thatthe isms in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriouslyattenuating the lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in aquasi-clumpy ism. lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phasemetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our samplehave z &lt; 0.4 zsol. we find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift laeanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxypopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicityrelationship. this implies that galaxies with lyman alpha in emission may besystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellarmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1107.4368	primus: the dependence of agn accretion on host stellar mass and color	we present evidence that the incidence of active galactic nuclei (agns) andthe distribution of their accretion rates do not depend on the stellar massesof their host galaxies, contrary to previous studies. we use hard (2-10 kev)x-ray data from three extragalactic fields (xmm-lss, cosmos and elais-s1) withredshifts from the prism multi-object survey to identify 242 agns with l_{2-10kev}=10^{42-44} erg /s within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0over ~3.4 deg^2 and to i~23. we find that although the fraction of galaxieshosting an agn at fixed x-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, thedistribution of x-ray luminosities is independent of mass. furthermore, we showthat the probability that a galaxy will host an agn can be defined by auniversal eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxystellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. these resultsdemonstrate that agns are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5&lt;logm_*/m_sun&lt;12 and that the same physical processes regulate agn activity in allgalaxies in this stellar mass range. while a higher agn fraction may beobserved in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to theunderlying eddington ratio distribution. we also find that the agn fractiondrops rapidly between z~1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced(factor~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. consequently, whileagn activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do notfind evidence that the presence of an agn is related to the quenching of starformation or the color transformation of galaxies.

1108.2503	calibrating the star formation rate at z=1 from optical data	we present a star-formation rate calibration based on optical data that isconsistent with average observed rates in both the red and blue galaxypopulations at z~1. the motivation for this study is to calculate sfrs fordeep2 redshift survey galaxies in the 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift range, but our resultsare generally applicable to similar optically-selected galaxy samples withoutrequiring uv or ir data. using sfrs fit from uv/optical seds in the aegissurvey, we explore the behavior of restframe b-band magnitude, observed [oii]luminosity, and restframe (u-b) color with sed-fit sfr for both red sequenceand blue cloud galaxies. we find that a sfr calibration can be calculated forall z~1 deep2 galaxies using a simultaneous fit in m_b and restframe colorswith residual errors that are within the sfr measurement error. the resultingsfr calibration produces fit residual errors of 0.3 dex rms scatter for thefull color-independent sample with minimal correlated residual error in l[oii]or stellar mass. we then compare the calibrated z~1 sfrs to two diagnosticsthat use l[oii] as a tracer in local galaxies and correct for dust extinctionat intermediate redshifts through either galaxy b-band luminosity or stellarmass. we find that a l[oii] - m_b sfr calibration commonly used in theliterature agrees well with our calculated sfrs after correcting for theaverage b-band luminosity evolution in l* galaxies. however, we find betteragreement with a local l[oii]-based sfr calibration that includes stellar massto correct for reddening effects, indicating that stellar mass is a bettertracer of dust extinction for all galaxy types and less affected by systematicevolution than galaxy luminosity from z=1 to the current epoch.

1108.2837	dust-corrected star formation rates of galaxies. ii. combinations of  ultraviolet and infrared tracers	we present new calibrations of far-ultraviolet (fuv) attenuation as derivedfrom the total infrared to fuv luminosity ratio (irx) and the fuv-nuv color. wefind that the irx-corrected fuv luminosities are tightly and linearlycorrelated with the attenuation-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities (as measuredfrom the balmer decrement), with a rms scatter of $\pm 0.09$ dex. the ratios ofthese attenuation-corrected fuv to h\alpha\ luminosities are consistent withevolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formationrate over 100 myr, solar metallicity and either a salpeter or a kroupa imf withlower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100\msun. the irx-corrected fuv tobalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosity ratios do not show any trend with othergalactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. in contrast,fuv attenuation derived from the fuv-nuv color (uv spectral slope) show muchlarger random and systematic uncertainties. when compared to eitherbalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities or irx-corrected fuv luminosities thecolor-corrected fuv luminosities show $\sim 2.5$ times larger rms scatter, andsystematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and otherparameters. linear combinations of 25um and 1.4ghz radio continuum luminositieswith the observed fuv luminosities are also well correlated with thebalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities. these results provide usefulprescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates ofgalaxies based on linear combinations of uv and ir or radio luminosities, whichare presented in convenient tabular form. comparisons of our calibrations withattenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws arealso made.

1112.3300	evolution of the stellar mass-metallicity relation since z=0.75	we measure the gas-phase oxygen abundances of ~3000 star-forming galaxies atz=0.05-0.75 using optical spectrophotometry from the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey (ages), a spectroscopic survey of i_ab&lt;20.45 galaxies over 7.9 deg^2 inthe noao deep wide field survey (ndwfs) bootes field. we use state-of-the-arttechniques to measure the nebular emission lines and stellar masses, andexplore and quantify several potential sources of systematic error, includingthe choice of metallicity diagnostic, aperture bias, and contamination fromunidentified active galactic nuclei (agn). combining volume-limited agessamples in six independent redshift bins and ~75,000 star-forming galaxies withr_ab&lt;17.6 at z=0.05-0.2 selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) thatwe analyze in the identical manner, we measure the evolution of the stellarmass-metallicity (m-z) between z=0.05 and z=0.75. we find that at fixed stellarmass galaxies at z~0.7 have just 30%-60% the metal content of galaxies at thepresent epoch, where the uncertainty is dominated by the strong-line methodused to measure the metallicity. moreover, we find no statistically significantevidence that the m-z relation evolves in a mass-dependent way form=10^9.8-10^11 msun star-forming galaxies. thus, for this range of redshiftsand stellar masses the m-z relation simply shifts toward lower metallicity withincreasing redshift without changing its shape.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1205.5072	star cluster populations in the outer disks of nearby galaxies	we present a large binocular telescope (lbt) imaging study that characterizesthe star cluster component of nearby galaxy outer disks (beyond the opticalradius r_25). expanding on the pilot project of herbert-fort et al.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1301.1688	primus: constraints on star formation quenching and galaxy merging, and  the evolution of the stellar mass function from z=0-1	we measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (smf) from z=0-1 usingmulti-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the prismmulti-object survey (primus) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). fromprimus we construct an i&lt;23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies atz=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the sdss we select~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect toprimus to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. we findthat the smf of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although wedo find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase inthe number density of ~10^10 msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a &lt;10% change inthe number density of all &gt;10^11 msun galaxies since z~1. dividing the sampleinto star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specificstar-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 msunstar-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z~0.6, whereas thespace-density of &gt;10^11 msun star-forming galaxies decreases by ~50% betweenz~1 and z~0. meanwhile, the number density of ~10^10 msun quiescent galaxiesincreases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, whilethe number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant sincez~1. these results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies arequenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of thestellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8msun. in addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominantchannel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z&lt;1, even among massive(&gt;10^11 msun) quiescent galaxies.

1301.1689	primus: an observationally motivated model to connect the evolution of  the agn and galaxy populations out to z~1	we present an observationally motivated model to connect the agn and galaxypopulations at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 and predict the agn x-ray luminosity function (xlf).we start with measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies (from theprism multi-object survey) and populate galaxies with agns using models for theprobability of a galaxy hosting an agn as a function of specific accretionrate. our model is based on measurements indicating that the specific accretionrate distribution is a universal function across a wide range of host stellarmass with slope gamma_1 = -0.65 and an overall normalization that evolves withredshift. we test several simple assumptions to extend this model to highspecific accretion rates (beyond the measurements) and compare the predictionsfor the xlf with the observed data. we find good agreement with a model thatallows for a break in the specific accretion rate distribution at a pointcorresponding to the eddington limit, a steep power-law tail to super-eddingtonratios with slope gamma_2 = -2.1 +0.3 -0.5, and a scatter of 0.38 dex in thescaling between black hole and host stellar mass. our results show that samplesof low luminosity agns are dominated by moderately massive galaxies (m* ~10^{10-11} m_sun) growing with a wide range of accretion rates due to the shapeof the galaxy stellar mass function rather than a preference for agn activityat a particular stellar mass. luminous agns may be a severely skewed populationwith elevated black hole masses relative to their host galaxies and in rarephases of rapid accretion.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1310.6040	the evolution of dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxy  clusters relative to the field over the last 9 billion years	we compare the star formation (sf) activity in cluster galaxies to the fieldfrom z=0.3-1.5 using $herschel$ spire 250$\mu$m imaging. we utilize 274clusters from the irac shallow cluster survey (iscs) selected as rest-framenear-infrared overdensities over the 9 square degree bootes field . thisanalysis allows us to quantify the evolution of sf in clusters over a longredshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. using a stackinganalysis, we determine the average star formation rates (sfrs) andspecific-sfrs (ssfr=sfr/m$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (m&gt;1.3x10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing boththe star forming and quiescent populations. we find a clear indication that theaverage sf in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, withfield sf levels at z&gt;1.2 in the cluster cores (r&lt;0.5 mpc), in good agreementwith previous iscs studies. by quantifying the sf in cluster and field galaxiesas an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxiesare evolving ~2 times faster than the field. additionally, we see enhanced sfabove the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r&gt;0.5 mpc). thesegeneral trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower massgalaxies in our sample. blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower ssfrsthan blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolutionwith respect to the field over our redshift range. this suggests that thecluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies onlong time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies tothe quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. we argue that our resultsare consistent with both strangulation and ram pressure stripping acting inthese clusters, with merger activity occurring in the cluster outskirts.

1411.1414	hubble space telescope combined strong and weak lensing analysis of the  clash sample: mass and magnification models and systematic uncertainties	we present results from a comprehensive lensing analysis in hst data, of thecomplete clash cluster sample. we identify new multiple-images previouslyundiscovered allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner massdistributions and profiles. we combine these strong-lensing constraints withweak-lensing shape measurements within the hst fov to jointly constrain themass distributions. the analysis is performed in two different commonparameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and darkmatter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical nfw form for the darkmatter), to provide a better assessment of the underlying systematics - whichis most important for deep, cluster-lensing surveys, especially when studyingmagnified high-redshift objects. we find that the typical (median), relativesystematic differences throughout the central fov are $\sim40\%$ in the(dimensionless) mass density, $\kappa$, and $\sim20\%$ in the magnification,$\mu$. we show maps of these differences for each cluster, as well as the massdistributions, critical curves, and 2d integrated mass profiles. for theeinstein radii ($z_{s}=2$) we find that all typically agree within $10\%$between the two models, and einstein masses agree, typically, within$\sim15\%$. at larger radii, the total projected, 2d integrated mass profilesof the two models, within $r\sim2\arcmin$, differ by $\sim30\%$. stacking thesurface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtainan average slope of $d\log (\sigma)/d\log(r)\sim-0.64\pm0.1$, in the radialrange [5,350] kpc. lastly, we also characterize the behavior of the averagemagnification, surface density, and shear differences between the two models,as a function of both the radius from the center, and the best-fit values ofthese quantities.

[oiii] 4363 is only detected in two hii regions both of which show indications ofexcitation by shocks. we compare our data to previous direct abundancesmeasured in ngc5194 and find excellent agreement for all but one region(delta[log(o/h)] ~ 0.04). we find no evidence of trends in ar/o, ne/o, or s/owithin ngc5194 or compared to other galaxies. we find modest negative gradientsin both o/h and n/o with very little scatter (sigma &lt; 0.08 dex), most of whichcan be attributed to random error and not to intrinsic dispersion. thegas-phase abundance gradient is consistent with the gradients observed in otherinteracting galaxies, which tend to be shallower than gradients measured inisolated galaxies. the n/o ratio (&lt;log(n/o)&gt; = -0.62) suggests secondarynitrogen production is responsible for a significantly larger fraction ofnitrogen (e.g., factor of 8-10) relative to primary production mechanisms thanpredicted by theoretical models.

1506.02051	preprocessing among the infalling galaxy population of ediscs clusters	we present results from a low-resolution spectroscopic survey for 21 galaxyclusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 selected from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). wemeasured spectra using the low-dispersion prism (ldp) in imacs on the magellanbaade telescope and calculate redshifts with a precision of $\sigma_z=0.006$.we find 1,602 galaxies that are brighter than r=22.6 in the large-scale clusterenvirons. we identify the galaxies expected to be accreted by the clusters asthey evolve to z=0 using spherical infall models, and find that ~30-70% of thez=0 cluster population lies outside the virial radius at z~0.6. for analogousclusters at z=0, we calculate that the ratio of galaxies that have fallen intothe clusters since z~0.6 to that which were already in the core at thatredshift is typically between ~0.3 and 1.5. this wide range of ratios is due tointrinsic scatter and is not a function of velocity dispersion, so a variety ofinfall histories is to be expected for clusters with current velocitydispersions of $300~&lt;\sigma&lt;~1200$ km/s. within the infall regions of z~0.6clusters, we find a larger red fraction of galaxies than in the field andgreater clustering among red galaxies than blue. we interpret these findings asevidence of "preprocessing", where galaxies in denser local environments havetheir star formation rates affected prior to their aggregation into massiveclusters, although the possibility of backsplash galaxies complicates theinterpretation.

1507.01945	galaxies probing galaxies at high resolution: co-rotating gas associated  with a milky way analog at z=0.4	we present results on gas flows in the halo of a milky way-like galaxy atz=0.413 based on high-resolution spectroscopy of a background galaxy. this isthe first study of circumgalactic gas at high spectral resolution towards anextended background source (i.e., a galaxy rather than a quasar). usinglongslit spectroscopy of the foreground galaxy, we observe spatially extended halpha emission with circular rotation velocity v=270 km/s. using echellespectroscopy of the background galaxy, we detect mg ii and fe ii absorptionlines at impact parameter rho=27 kpc that are blueshifted from systemic in thesense of the foreground galaxy's rotation. the strongest absorber ew(2796) =0.90 a has an estimated column density (n_h&gt;10^19 cm-2) and line-of-sightvelocity dispersion (sigma=17 km/s) that are consistent with the observedproperties of extended h i disks in the local universe. our analysis of therotation curve also suggests that this r=30 kpc gaseous disk is warped withrespect to the stellar disk. in addition, we detect two weak mg ii absorbers inthe halo with small velocity dispersions (sigma&lt;10 km/s). while the exactgeometry is unclear, one component is consistent with an extraplanar gas cloudnear the disk-halo interface that is co-rotating with the disk, and the otheris consistent with a tidal feature similar to the magellanic stream. we canplace lower limits on the cloud sizes (l&gt;0.4 kpc) for these absorbers given theextended nature of the background source. we discuss the implications of theseresults for models of the geometry and kinematics of gas in the circumgalacticmedium.

1507.07340	the mass distribution in an assembling super galaxy group at $z=0.37$	we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of supergroup sg1120$-$1202,consisting of four distinct x-ray-luminous groups, that will merge to form acluster comparable in mass to coma at $z=0$. these groups lie within aprojected separation of 1 to 4 mpc and within $\delta v=550$ km s$^{-1}$ andform a unique protocluster to study the matter distribution in a coalescingsystem.  using high-resolution {\em hst}/acs imaging, combined with an extensivespectroscopic and imaging data set, we study the weak gravitational distortionof background galaxy images by the matter distribution in the supergroup. wecompare the reconstructed projected density field with the distribution ofgalaxies and hot x-ray emitting gas in the system and derive halo parametersfor the individual density peaks.  we show that the projected mass distribution closely follows the locations ofthe x-ray peaks and associated brightest group galaxies. one of the groups thatlies at slightly lower redshift ($z\approx 0.35$) than the other three groups($z\approx 0.37$) is x-ray luminous, but is barely detected in thegravitational lensing signal. the other three groups show a significantdetection (up to $5 \sigma$ in mass), with velocity dispersions between$355^{+55}_{-70}$ and $530^{+45}_{-55}$ km s$^{-1}$ and masses between$0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{14}$ and $1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\times 10^{14} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$, consistent with independent measurements. these groups areassociated with peaks in the galaxy and gas density in a relativelystraightforward manner. since the groups show no visible signs of interaction,this supports the picture that we are catching the groups before they mergeinto a cluster.

1509.00487	star formation activity in clash brightest cluster galaxies	the clash x-ray selected sample of 20 galaxy clusters contains ten brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) that exhibit significant ($&gt;$5 $\sigma$)extinction-corrected star formation rates (sfrs). star formation activity isinferred from photometric estimates of uv and h$\alpha$+[\ion{n}{2}] emissionin knots and filaments detected in clash hst acs and wfc3 observations.uv-derived sfrs in these bcgs span two orders of magnitude, including two witha sfr $\gtrsim$ 100 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. these measurements are supplementedwith [\ion{o}{2}], [\ion{o}{3}], and h$\beta$ fluxes measured from spectraobtained with the soar telescope. we confirm that photoionization from ongoingstar formation powers the line emission nebulae in these bcgs, although in manybcgs there is also evidence of a liner-like contribution to the line emission.coupling these data with chandra x-ray measurements, we infer that the starformation occurs exclusively in low-entropy cluster cores and exhibits acorrelation with gas properties related to cooling. we also perform an in-depthstudy of the starburst history of the bcg in the cluster rxj1532.9+3021, andcreate 2d maps of stellar properties on scales down to $\sim$350 pc. these mapsreveal evidence for an ongoing burst occurring in elongated filaments,generally on $\sim$ 0.5-1.0 gyr timescales, although some filaments areconsistent with much younger ($\lesssim$ 100 myr) burst timescales and may becorrelated with recent activity from the agn. the relationship between bcg sfrsand the surrounding icm gas properties provide new support for the process offeedback-regulated cooling in galaxy clusters and is consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

0806.4387	the late stellar assembly of massive cluster galaxies via major merging	we present multi-wavelength observations of the brightest galaxies in fourx-ray luminous groups at z~0.37 that will merge to form a cluster comparable inmass to coma. ordered by increasing stellar mass, the four brightest groupgalaxies (bggs) present a time sequence where bgg-1, 2, and 3 are in mergingsystems and bgg-4 is a massive remnant [m(stars)=6.7x10^(11) msun]. bgg-1 and 2have bright, gravitationally bound companions and bgg-3 has two nucleiseparated by only 2.5 kpc, thus merging at z&lt;0.5 increases the bgg mass by &gt;40%(merging timescale&lt;2 gyr) and v-band luminosity by ~0.4 mag. the bggs'rest-frame (b-v) colors correspond to stellar ages of &gt;3 gyr, and their tightscatter in (b-v) color [sigma(bv)=0.032] confirms they formed the bulk of theirstars at z&gt;0.9. optical spectroscopy shows no signs of recent (&lt;1.5 gyr) orongoing star formation. only two bggs are weakly detected at 24 microns, andx-ray and optical data indicate the emission in bgg-2 is due to an agn. allfour bggs and their companions are early-type (bulge-dominated) galaxies, andthey are embedded in diffuse stellar envelopes up to ~140 kpc across. the fourbgg systems must evolve into the massive, red, early-type galaxies dominatinglocal clusters. our results show that: 1) massive galaxies in groups andclusters form via dissipationless merging; and 2) the group environment iscritical for this process.

astro-ph;0204192	deviations from the local hubble flow. i. the tip of the red giant  branch as a distance indicator	the properties of the velocity field in the local volume (cz &lt; 550 km/s) havebeen difficult to constrain due to a lack of a consistent set of galaxydistances. the sparse observations available to date suggest a remarkably quietflow, with little deviation from a pure hubble law. however, velocity fieldmodels based on the distribution of galaxies in the 1.2 jy iras redshiftsurvey, predict a quadrupolar flow pattern locally with strong infall at thepoles of the local supergalactic plane. we probe this velocity field and beginto establish a consistent set of galactic distances. we have obtained images ofnearby galaxies in the i and v band from the w.m. keck observatory and in f814wand f555w filters from the hubble space telescope. where these galaxies arewell resolved into stars we may use the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) as adistance indicator. using a maximum likelihood analysis to quantitativelymeasure the i magnitude of the trgb we determine precise distances to sevennearby galaxies: leo i, sextans b, ngc 1313, ngc 3109, ugc 03755, ugc 06456,and ugc 07577.

astro-ph;0511730	optical star-formation rate indicators	using integrated optical spectrophotometry for 412 star-forming galaxies atz~0, and fiber-aperture spectrophotometry for 120,846 sdss galaxies at z~0.1,we investigate the h-alpha, h-beta, [o ii] 3727, and [o iii] 5007 nebularemission lines and the u-band luminosity as quantitative star-formation rate(sfr) indicators. we demonstrate that the extinction-corrected h-alphaluminosity is a reliable sfr tracer even in highly obscured star-forminggalaxies. we find that variations in dust reddening dominate the systematicuncertainty in sfrs derived from the observed h-beta, [o ii], and u-bandluminosities, producing a factor of ~1.7, ~2.5, and ~2.1 scatter in the meantransformations, respectively. we show that [o ii] depends weakly on variationsin oxygen abundance over a wide range in metallicity, 12+log(o/h)=8.15-8.7 dex(z/z_sun=0.28-1.0), and that in this metallicity interval galaxies occupy anarrow range in ionization parameter (-3.8&lt;log u&lt;-2.9 dex). we show that thescatter in [o iii] 5007 as a sfr indicator is a factor of 3-4 due to itssensitivity to metal abundance and ionization. we develop empirical sfrcalibrations for h-beta and [o ii] parameterized in terms of the b-bandluminosity, which remove the systematic effects of reddening and metallicity,and reduce the sfr scatter to +/-40% and +/-90%, respectively, althoughindividual galaxies may deviate substantially from the median relations.finally, we compare the z~0 relations between blue luminosity and reddening,ionization, and [o ii]/h-alpha ratio against measurements at z~1 and find broadagreement.

astro-ph;0511731	integrated nebular abundances of disk galaxies	we study whether integrated optical spectroscopy of a disk galaxy can be usedto infer the mean, or characteristic gas-phase oxygen abundance in the presenceof systematic effects such as spatial abundance variations, contributions tothe integrated emission-line spectrum from diffuse-ionized gas, and dustattenuation. our sample consists of 14 nearby disk galaxies with integratedspectrophotometry, and observations of more than 250 individual hii regionsculled from the literature. we consider both theoretical and empiricalstrong-line abundance calibrations based on the r23=([oii]+[oiii])/h-betaparameter. we find that the integrated oxygen abundance correlates well withthe gas-phase abundance measured at a fixed galactocentric radius, asdetermined by the hii-region abundance gradient. the typical scatter in thecorrelation is +/-0.1 dex, independent of the abundance calibration, or whetherthe observed integrated emission-line fluxes, the reddening-corrected fluxes,or the emission-line equivalent widths are used. integrated abundances based onthe observed fluxes or equivalent widths, however, are susceptible toadditional systematic effects of order 0.05-0.1 dex, at least for the range ofreddenings and stellar populations spanned by our sample. unlike the integratedr23 parameter, we find that the integrated [nii]/h-alpha and [sii]/h-alpharatios are enhanced with respect to line-ratios typical of hii regions,consistent with a modest contribution from diffuse-ionized gas emission. weconclude that the r23 parameter can be used to reliably measure the gas-phaseabundances of distant star-forming galaxies.

0811.1398	the origin of the 24-micron excess in red galaxies	observations with the spitzer space telescope have revealed a population ofred-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emissioncompared to what is expected from an old stellar population. we identify 900red galaxies with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages)selected from the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. using spitzer/mips,we classify 89 (~10%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24&gt;0.3 mjy). wedetermine the prevalence of agn and star-formation activity in all the agesgalaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-ir color-color criteria. usingthe irac color-color diagram from the irac shallow survey, we find that 64% ofthe 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emissionfeatures in the 8-micron irac band. this fraction is significantly larger thanthe 5% of red galaxies with f24&lt;0.3 mjy that are estimated to have strong pahemission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due tostar-formation processes. only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies haveoptical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classifiedas agn and 21% are unclassifiable). the difference between the optical andinfrared results suggest that both agn and star-formation activity is occurringsimultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. these resultsshould serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical linediagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared andother bands. we find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-onspiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. the remaining sources are likelyto be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination ofobscured agn and star-formation activity.

0811.3035	the [o ii] lambda 3727 luminosity function at z ~ 1	we measure the evolution of the [oii]lambda 3727 luminosity function at0.75&lt;z&lt;1.45 using high-resolution spectroscopy of ~14,000 galaxies observed bythe deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that brighter than l_{oii}=10^{42}erg s^(-1) the luminosity function is well-represented by a power law dn/dl ~l^{\alpha} with slope \alpha ~ -3. the number density of [oii] emittinggalaxies above this luminosity declines by a factor of &gt;~2.5 between z ~ 1.35and z ~ 0.84. in the limit of no number-density evolution, the characteristic[oii] luminosity, l^*_[oii], defined as the luminosity where the space densityequals 10^{-3.5} dex^{-1} mpc^{-3}, declines by a factor of ~1.8 over the sameredshift interval. assuming that l_[oii] is proportional to the star-formationrate (sfr), and negligible change in the typical dust attenuation in galaxiesat fixed [oii] luminosity, the measured decline in l^*_[oii] implies a ~25% pergyr decrease in the amount of star formation in galaxies during this epoch.adopting a faint-end power-law slope of -1.3\pm0.2, we derive the comoving sfrdensity in four redshift bins centered around z~1 by integrating the observed[oii] luminosity function using a local, empirical calibration between l_[oii]and sfr, which statistically accounts for variations in dust attenuation andmetallicity among galaxies. we find that our estimate of the sfr density at z~1is consistent with previous measurements based on a variety of independent sfrindicators.
