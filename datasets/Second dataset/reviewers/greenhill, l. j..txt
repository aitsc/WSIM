0904.1373	maser emission from sio isotopologues traces the innermost 100 au around  radio source i in orion bn/kl	we have used the very large array (vla) at 7 mm wavelength to image fiverotational transitions (j=1-0) from three sio isotopologues towards orionbn/kl: 28sio v=0,1,2; and 29sio and 30sio v=0. for the first time, we havemapped the 29sio and 30sio j=1-0 emission, established the maser nature of theemission, and confirmed association with the deeply embedded high-mass youngstellar object commonly denoted radio source i. the 28sio v=0 maser emissionshows a bipolar structure that extends over ~700 au along a northeast-southwestaxis, and we propose that it traces a bipolar outflow driven by source i. thehigh-brightness isotopic sio maser emission imaged with a ~0.2 arcsecresolution has a more compact distribution, generally similar to that of the28sio v=1,2 emission, and it probably traces bulk gas flows in a region ofdiameter &lt;100 au centered on source i. on small scales of &lt;10 au, however,compact 29sio/30sio v=0 and 28sio v=1,2 emission features may be offset fromone another in position and line-of-sight velocity.  from a radiative transfer analysis based on a large velocity gradient (lvg)pumping model, we derive similar temperatures and densities for the optimumexcitation of both 29sio/30sio v=0 and 28sio v=1,2 masers, significantly higherthan required for 28sio v=0 maser excitation. in order to account for thesmall-scale differences among the isotopologues (v=0) and the main species(v=1,2), follow-up radiative transfer modeling that incorporates non-local lineoverlap among transitions of all sio isotopic species may be required.

0911.2473	a feature movie of sio emission 20-100 au from the massive young stellar  object orion source i	we present multi-epoch vlba imaging of the 28sio v=1 &amp; v=2, j=1-0 maseremission toward the massive yso orion source i. both sio transitions wereobserved simultaneously with an angular resolution of ~0.5 mas (~0.2 au ford=414 pc). here we explore the global properties and kinematics of the emissionthrough two 19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (2001 march 19 to 2002december 10). these movies provide the most detailed view to date of thedynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material within ~20-100 au of amassive (~&gt;8m_sun) yso. the bulk of the sio masers surrounding source i lie inan x-shaped locus; emission in the south/east arms is predominantly blueshiftedand in the north and west is predominantly redshifted. in addition, bridges ofintermediate-velocity emission connect the red and blue sides of the emissiondistribution. we have measured proper motions of &gt;1000 maser features and finda combination of radially outward migrations along the four arms and motionstangent to the bridges. we interpret the sio masers as arising from awide-angle bipolar wind emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. the detectionof maser features along extended, curved filaments suggests that magneticfields may play a role in launching and/or shaping the wind. our observationsappear to support a picture in which stars with m ~&gt;8 m_sun form viadisk-mediated accretion. however, we cannot rule out that the source i disk mayhave been formed or altered following a close encounter.

0709.0925	toward a new distance to the active galaxy ngc 4258: ii. centripetal  accelerations and investigation of spiral structure	we report measurements of centripetal accelerations of maser spectralcomponents of ngc 4258 for 51 epochs spanning 1994 to 2004. this is the secondpaper of a series, in which the goal is determination of a new geometric maserdistance to ngc 4258 accurate to possibly ~3%. we measure accelerations using aformal analysis method that involves simultaneous decomposition of maserspectra for all epochs into multiple, gaussian components. components arecoupled between epochs by linear drifts (accelerations) from their centroidvelocities at a reference epoch. for high-velocity emission, accelerations liein the range -0.7 to +0.7 km/s/yr indicating an origin within 13 degrees of thedisk midline (the perpendicular to the line-of-sight to the black hole).comparison of high-velocity emission projected positions in vlbi images, withthose derived from acceleration data, provides evidence that masers trace realgas dynamics. high-velocity emission accelerations do not support a model oftrailing shocks associated with spiral arms in the disk. however, we findstrengthened evidence for spatial periodicity in high-velocity emission, ofwavelength 0.75 mas. this supports suggestions of spiral structure due todensity waves in the nuclear accretion disk of an active galaxy. accelerationsof low-velocity (systemic) emission lie in the range 7.7 to 8.9 km/s/yr,consistent with emission originating from a concavity where the thin, warpeddisk is tangent to the line-of-sight. a trend in accelerations of low-velocityemission as a function of doppler velocity may be associated with disk geometryand orientation, or with the presence of spiral structure.

1012.3719	subtraction of point sources from interferometric radio images through  an algebraic forward modeling scheme	we present a method for subtracting point sources from interferometric radioimages via forward modeling of the instrument response and involving analgebraic nonlinear minimization. the method is applied to simulated maps ofthe murchison wide-field array but is generally useful in cases where onlyimage data are available. after source subtraction, the residual maps have nostatistical difference to the expected thermal noise distribution at allangular scales, indicating high effectiveness in the subtraction. simulationsindicate that the errors in recovering the source parameters decrease withincreasing signal-to-noise ratio, which is consistent with the theoreticalmeasurement errors. in applying the technique to simulated snapshotobservations with the murchison wide-field array, we found that all 101 sourcespresent in the simulation were recovered with an average position error of 10arcsec and an average flux density error of 0.15%. this led to a dynamic rangeincrease of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. since all the sources weredeconvolved jointly, the subtraction was not limited by source sidelobes but bythermal noise. this technique is a promising deconvolution method for upcomingradio arrays with a huge number of elements, and a candidate for the difficulttask of subtracting foreground sources from observations of the 21 cm neutralhydrogen signal from the epoch of reionization.

1106.4202	unveiling sources of heating in the vicinity of the orion bn/kl hot core  as traced by highly excited inversion transitions of ammonia	using the expanded very large array, we have mapped the vicinity of the orionbn/kl hot core with sub-arcsecond angular resolution in seven metastableinversion transitions of ammonia: (j,k)=(6,6) to (12,12). this emission comesfrom levels up to 1500 k above the ground state, enabling identification ofsource(s) responsible for heating the region. we used this multi-transitiondataset to produce images of the rotational/kinetic temperature and the columndensity of ammonia for ortho and para species separately and on aposition-by-position basis. we find rotational temperature and column densityin the range 160-490 k and (1-4)x10^17 cm^-2, respectively. ourspatially-resolved images show that the highest (column) density and hottestgas is found in a northeast-southwest elongated ridge to the southeast ofsource i. we have also measured the ortho-para ratio of ammonia, estimated tovary in the range 0.9-1.6. enhancement of ortho with respect to para and theoffset of hot ammonia emission peaks from known (proto)stellar sources provideevidence that the ammonia molecules have been released from dust grains intothe gas-phase through the passage of shocks and not by stellar radiation. wepropose that the combined effect of source i's proper motion and itslow-velocity outflow impinging on a pre-existing dense medium is responsiblefor the excitation of ammonia and the orion hot core. finally, we found for thefirst time evidence of a slow (5 km/s) and compact (1000 au) outflow towardsirc7.

1203.1293	a new layout optimization technique for interferometric arrays, applied  to the mwa	antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometersbecause it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (psf,or array beam). this is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cmepoch of reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtractiondepends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of thebaseline distribution. nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas canbe placed---even at the remote australian location of the mwa (murchisonwidefield array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas,emergency runways and trees. these exclusion areas can introduce spatialstructure into the baseline distribution that enhance the psf sidelobes andreduce the angular dynamic range. in this paper we present a new method ofconstrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in thebaseline distribution. this method not only outperforms random placementalgorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms randomplacement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are thesmoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. we use our newalgorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned mwa, andpresent the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot psf for thisarray choice.

1308.2742	on the detection and tracking of space debris using the murchison  widefield array. i. simulations and test observations demonstrate feasibility	the murchison widefield array (mwa) is a new low frequency interferomericradio telescope. the mwa is the low frequency precursor to the square kilometrearray (ska) and is the first of three ska precursors to be operational,supporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of theepoch of reionisation to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. weexplore the possibility that the mwa can be used for the purposes of spacesituational awareness (ssa). in particular we propose that the mwa can be usedas an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5- 108 mhz (the commercial fm broadcast band). in this scenario the mwa can beconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with fmbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. the fm broadcastspropagate into space, are reflected off debris in earth orbit, and are receivedat the mwa. the imaging capabilities of the mwa can be used to simultaneouslydetect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as afunction of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determineorbital parameters. such a capability would be a valuable addition toaustralian and global ssa assets, in terms of southern and eastern hemisphericcoverage. we provide a feasibility assessment of this proposal, based on simplecalculations and electromagnetic simulations that shows the detection ofsub-metre size debris should be possible (debris radius of &gt;0.5 m to ~1000 kmaltitude). we also present a proof-of-concept set of observations thatdemonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, based on the detection andtracking of the international space station via reflected fm broadcast signalsoriginating in south-west western australia. these observations broadlyvalidate our calculations and simulations.

0705.0699	a documentary of high-mass star formation: probing the dynamical  evolution of orion source i on 10-100 au scales using sio masers	a comprehensive picture of high-mass star formation has remained elusive, inpart because examples of high-mass ysos tend to be relatively distant, deeplyembedded, and confused with other emission sources. these factors have impededdynamical investigations within tens of au of high-mass ysos--scales that arecritical for probing the interfaces where outflows from accretion disks arelaunched and collimated. using observations of sio masers obtained with the vlaand the vlba, the kalypso project is overcoming these limitations by mappingthe structure and dynamical/temporal evolution of the material 10-1000 au fromthe nearest high-mass yso: radio source i in the orion bn/kl region. our datainclude ~40 epochs of vlba observations over a several-year period, allowing usto track the proper motions of individual sio maser spots and to monitorchanges in the physical conditions of the emitting material with time.ultimately these data will provide 3-d maps of the outflow structure overapproximately 30% of the outflow crossing time. here we summarize recentresults from the kalypso project, including evidence that high-mass starformation is occurring via disk-mediated accretion.

1502.07596	foregrounds in wide-field redshifted 21 cm power spectra	detection of 21~cm emission of hi from the epoch of reionization, atredshifts z&gt;6, is limited primarily by foreground emission. we investigate thesignatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using thedelay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground objectlocations through signal delays between antenna pairs. we demonstrateinterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, includingthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.these wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapesimpact their amplitudes substantially. a dish-shaped antenna yields the mostdesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to adipole or a phased array. comparing data from recent murchison widefield arrayobservations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have thelargest impact on the hi signal arise from power received far away from theprimary field of view. we identify diffuse emission near the horizon as asignificant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usuallyrepresent structures on small scales. for signals entering through the primaryfield of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. thesetwo mechanisms imprint a characteristic "pitchfork" signature on the"foreground wedge" in fourier delay space. based on these results, we proposethat selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time canmitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor ~100 withnegligible loss of sensitivity.

1505.06421	hdfits: porting the fits data model to hdf5	the fits (flexible image transport system) data format has been the de factodata format for astronomy-related data products since its inception in the late1970s. while the fits file format is widely supported, it lacks many of thefeatures of more modern data serialization, such as the hierarchical dataformat (hdf5). the hdf5 file format offers considerable advantages over fits,such as improved i/o speed and compression, but has yet to gain widespreadadoption within astronomy. one of the major holdbacks is that hdf5 is not wellsupported by data reduction software packages and image viewers. here, wepresent a comparison of fits and hdf5 as a format for storage of astronomydatasets. we show that the underlying data model of fits can be ported to hdf5in a straightforward manner, and that by doing so the advantages of the hdf5file format can be leveraged immediately. in addition, we present a softwaretool, fits2hdf, for converting between fits and a new `hdfits' format, wheredata are stored in hdf5 in a fits-like manner. we show that hdfits allowsfaster reading of data (up to 100x of fits in some use cases), and improvedcompression (higher compression ratios and higher throughput). finally, we showthat by only changing the import lines in python-based fits utilities, hdfitsformatted data can be presented transparently as an in-memory fits equivalent.

1506.01026	empirical covariance modeling for 21 cm power spectrum estimation: a  method demonstration and new limits from early murchison widefield array  128-tile data	the separation of the faint cosmological background signal from brightastrophysical foregrounds remains one of the most daunting challenges ofmapping the high-redshift intergalactic medium with the redshifted 21 cm lineof neutral hydrogen. advances in mapping and modeling of diffuse and pointsource foregrounds have improved subtraction accuracy, but no subtractionscheme is perfect. precisely quantifying the errors and error correlations dueto missubtracted foregrounds allows for both the rigorous analysis of the 21 cmpower spectrum and for the maximal isolation of the "eor window" fromforeground contamination. we present a method to infer the covariance offoreground residuals from the data itself in contrast to previous attempts at apriori modeling. we demonstrate our method by setting limits on the powerspectrum using a 3 h integration from the 128-tile murchison widefield array.observing between 167 and 198 mhz, we find at 95% confidence a best limit ofdelta^2(k) &lt; 3.7 x 10^4 mk^2 at comoving scale k = 0.18 hmpc^-1 and at z = 6.8,consistent with existing limits.

1506.06150	confirmation of wide-field signatures in redshifted 21 cm power spectra	we confirm our recent prediction of the "pitchfork" foreground signature inpower spectra of high-redshift 21 cm measurements where the interferometer issensitive to large-scale structure on all baselines. this is due to theinherent response of a wide-field instrument and is characterized by enhancedpower from foreground emission in fourier modes adjacent to those considered tobe the most sensitive to the cosmological h i signal. in our recent paper, manysignatures from the simulation that predicted this feature were validatedagainst murchison widefield array (mwa) data, but this key pitchfork signaturewas close to the noise level. in this paper, we improve the data sensitivitythrough the coherent averaging of 12 independent snapshots with identicalinstrument settings and provide the first confirmation of the prediction with asignal-to-noise ratio &gt; 10. this wide-field effect can be mitigated by carefulantenna designs that suppress sensitivity near the horizon. simple models forantenna apertures that have been proposed for future instruments such as thehydrogen epoch of reionization array and the square kilometre array indicatethey should suppress foreground leakage from the pitchfork by ~40 db relativeto the mwa and significantly increase the likelihood of cosmological signaldetection in these critical fourier modes in the three-dimensional powerspectrum.

1507.01184	ionospheric modelling using gps to calibrate the mwa. 1: comparison of  first order ionospheric effects between gps models and mwa observations	we compare first order (refractive) ionospheric effects seen by the murchisonwidefield array (mwa) with the ionosphere as inferred from global positioningsystem (gps) data. the first order ionosphere manifests itself as a bulkposition shift of the observed sources across an mwa field of view. theseeffects can be computed from global ionosphere maps provided by gps analysiscentres, namely the center for orbit determination in europe (code), using datafrom globally distributed gps receivers. however, for the more accurate localionosphere estimates required for precision radio astronomy applications, datafrom local gps networks needs to be incorporated into ionospheric modelling.for gps observations, the ionospheric parameters are biased by gps receiverinstrument delays, among other effects, also known as receiver differentialcode biases (dcbs). the receiver dcbs need to be estimated for any non-code gpsstation used for ionosphere modelling, a requirement for establishing dense gpsnetworks in arbitrary locations in the vicinity of the mwa. in this work,single gps station-based ionospheric modelling is performed at a timeresolution of 10 minutes. also the receiver dcbs are estimated for selectedgeoscience australia (ga) gps receivers, located at murchison radio observatory(mro1), yarragadee (yar3), mount magnet (mtma) and wiluna (wilu). theionospheric gradients estimated from gps are compared with the ionosphericgradients inferred from radio source position shifts observed with the mwa. theionospheric gradients at all the gps stations show a correlation with thegradients observed with the mwa. the ionosphere estimates obtained using gpsmeasurements show promise in terms of providing calibration information for themwa.

astro-ph;0206185	towards proper motions in the local group	key and still largely missing parameters for measuring the mass content anddistribution of the local group are the proper motion vectors of its membergalaxies. the problem when trying to derive the gravitational potential of thelocal group is that usually only radial velocities are known, and hencestatistical approaches have to be used. the expected proper motions forgalaxies within the local group, ranging from 20 to 100 $\mu$as/yr, aredetectable with vlbi using the phase-referencing technique. we presentphase-referencing observations of bright masers in ic~10 and m33 with respectto background quasars. we observed the h$_2$o masers in ic10 three times over aperiod of two months to check the accuracy of the relative positions. therelative positions were obtained by modeling the interferometer phase data forthe maser sources referenced to the background quasars. the model allowed for arelative position shift for the source and a single vertical atmospheric delayerror in the correlator model for each antenna. the rms of the relativepositions for the three observations is only 0.01 mas, which is approximatelythe expected position error due to thermal noise. also, we present a method tomeasure the geometric distance to m33. this will allow re-calibration of theextragalactic distance scale based on cepheids. the method is to measure therelative proper motions of two h$_2$o maser sources on opposite sides of m33.the measured angular rotation rate, coupled with other measurements of theinclination and rotation speed of the galaxy, yields a direct distancemeasurement.

astro-ph;0211226	discovery of water vapor megamaser emission from mrk1419 (ngc 2690): an  analogue of ngc 4258?	water vapor emission at 22 ghz is reported from the nucleus of the linergalaxy mrk 1419 (ngc 2960). single-dish spectra of the maser source showproperties that are similar to those seen in ngc 4258, namely (1) a cluster ofsystemic h2o features, (2) two additional h2o clusters, one red- and oneblue-shifted by about 475 km/s, (3) a likely acceleration of the systemicfeatures, and (4) no detectable velocity drifts in the red- and blue-shiftedfeatures. interpreting the data in terms of the paradigm established for ngc4258, i.e. assuming the presence of an edge-on keplerian circumnuclear annuluswith the systemic emission arising from the near side of its inner edge, thefollowing parameters are derived: rotational velocity: 330-600 km/s; radius:0.13-0.43 pc; binding mass: about 10 million solar masses. with the galaxybeing approximately ten times farther away than ngc 4258, a comparison oflinear and angular scales (the latter via very long baseline interferometry)may provide an accurate geometric distance to mrk 1419 that could be used tocalibrate the cosmic distance scale.

astro-ph;0302533	a warped accretion disk and wide angle outflow in the inner parsec of  the circinus galaxy	we present the first vlbi maps of h2o maser emission (lambda 1.3cm) in thenucleus of the circinus galaxy, constructed from data obtained with theaustralia telescope long baseline array. the maser emission traces a warped,edge-on accretion disk between radii of 0.11+/-0.02 and ~0.40 pc, as well as awide-angle outflow that extends up to ~1 pc from the estimated disk center. thedisk rotation is close to keplerian (v varies as 1/sqrt(r)), the maximumdetected rotation speed is 260 km/s, and the inferred central mass is 1.7+/-0.3x 10^6 solar masses. the outflowing masers are irregularly distributed aboveand below the disk, with relative outflow velocities up to ~+/-160 km/s,projected along the line of sight. the flow probably originates closer than 0.1pc to the central engine, possibly in an inward extension of the accretiondisk, though there is only weak evidence of rotation in the outward movingmaterial. we observe that the warp of the disk appears to collimate the outflowand to fix the extent of the ionization cone observed on larger angular scales.this study provides the first direct evidence (i.e., through imaging) of dusty,high-density, molecular material in a nuclear outflow &lt;1 pc from the centralengine of a seyfert galaxy, as well as the first graphic evidence that warpedaccretion disks can channel outflows and illumination patterns in agn. wespeculate that the same arrangement, which in some ways obviates the need for ageometrically thick, dusty torus, may apply to other type-2 agn.

astro-ph;0504405	the geometry of and mass accretion rate through the maser accretion disk  in ngc 4258	a maximum likelihood analysis of the ngc 4258 maser positions and velocitiesreveals a ~2 sigma deviation from keplerian motion in the projected rotationcurve of the high-velocity features, corresponding to a ~9 km/s, or 0.8%,flattening of the los velocities with respect to keplerian motion over therange of the high-velocity masers. while there are a number of potentialexplanations for this flattening, we argue for pure keplerian rotation in aninclination-warped disk based on the ability of this model to explain a numberof otherwise puzzling features of the system. a radial gradient in the diskinclination of 0.034 mas^{-1} is not only consistent with the observed rotationcurve, but it generates a bowl along the near edge of the disk that naturallyexplains the otherwise puzzling narrow spread in the declinations of thesystemic masers. it also explains the existence and location of an apparentlyrecurring flare amongst the systemic masers. there is no significant evidencefor non-keplerian rotation in the inclination-warped disk. an additionalimplication of the inclination warp is that the disk rises in front of andobscures the central engine at a disk radius of about 8.3 mas, or 0.29 pc. bycomparing the observed x-ray column to conditions in the disk at this radius,we argue that the molecular-to-atomic transition occurs just beyond theoutermost maser at 0.28 pc and from this we infer an accretion rate of\~10^{-4}alpha m_sun/yr, consistent with the jet-dominated accretion models ofyuan et al. (2002). our model suggests that most of the observed x-ray columnarises in the warped accretion disk at 0.29 pc, and that the maser emission istruncated at large radii predominantly as a result of the molecular-to-atomicphase transition originally proposed by neufeld &amp; maloney (1995).

(the blue-shiftedemission has not yet been imaged with vlbi.) based on the maser velocities andthe relative orientation of the known radio jet, we propose that the maseremission arises on the surface of a nearly edge-on torus, where physicalconditions are conducive to maser action. the visible part of the torus isaxially thick, with comparable height and radius. the velocity field indicatessub-keplerian differential rotation around a central mass of about 1e7 msunthat lies within a cylindrical radius of about 0.65 pc. the estimatedluminosity of the central engine is about 0.5 of the eddington limit. there isno detectable compact radio continuum emission near the proposed center of thetorus (t_b&lt; 5e6 k on size scales of about 0.1 pc), so that the observedflat-spectrum core cannot be direct self-absorbed synchrotron radiation.
