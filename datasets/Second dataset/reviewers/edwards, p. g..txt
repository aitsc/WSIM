0906.4924	reanalysis of data taken by the cangaroo 3.8 meter imaging atmospheric  cherenkov telescope: psr b1706-44, sn 1006, and vela	we have reanalyzed data from observations of psr b1706-44, sn 1006, and thevela pulsar region made with the cangaroo 3.8 m imaging atmospheric cherenkovtelescope between 1993 and 1998 in response to the results reported for thesesources by the h.e.s.s. collaboration. in our reanalysis, in which gamma-rayselection criteria have been determined exclusively using gamma-ray simulationsand off-source data as background samples, no significant tev gamma-ray signalshave been detected from compact regions around psr b1706-44 or within thenortheast rim of sn 1006. we discuss reasons why the original analyses gave thesource detections. the reanalysis did result in a tev gamma-ray signal from thevela pulsar region at the 4.5 sigma level using 1993, 1994, and 1995 data. theexcess was located at the same position, 0.13 deg. to the southeast of the velapulsar, as that reported in the original analysis. we have investigated theeffect of the acceptance distribution in the field of view of the 3.8 mtelescope, which rapidly decreases toward the edge of the field of the camera,on the detected gamma-ray morphology. the expected excess distribution for the3.8 m telescope has been obtained by reweighting the distribution of hessj0835-455 measured by h.e.s.s. with the acceptance of the 3.8 m telescope. theresult is morphologically comparable to the cangaroo excess distribution,although the profile of the acceptance-reweighted h.e.s.s. distribution is morediffuse than that of cangaroo. the integral gamma-ray flux from hess j0835-455has been estimated for the same region as defined by h.e.s.s. from the1993-1995 data of cangaroo to be f(&gt; 4.0 +/- 1.6 tev) = (3.28 +/- 0.92) x10^{-12} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is statistically consistent with theintegral flux obtained by h.e.s.s.

0908.3301	cangaroo-iii search for tev gamma-rays from two clusters of galaxies	because accretion and merger shocks in clusters of galaxies may accelerateparticles to high energies, clusters are candidate sites for the origin ofultra-high-energy (uhe) cosmic-rays. a prediction was presented for gamma-rayemission from a cluster of galaxies at a detectable level with the currentgeneration of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. the gamma-ray emissionwas produced via inverse compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background(cmb) photons by electron-positron pairs generated by collisions of uhe cosmicrays in the cluster. we observed two clusters of galaxies, abell 3667 and abell4038, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission with the cangaroo-iiiatmospheric cherenkov telescope system in 2006. the analysis showed nosignificant excess around these clusters, yielding upper limits on thegamma-ray emission. from a comparison of the upper limit for the north-westradio relic region of abell 3667 with a model prediction, we derive a lowerlimit for the magnetic field of the region of ~0.1 micro g. this shows thepotential of gamma-ray observations in studies of the cluster environment. wealso discuss the flux upper limit from cluster center regions using a model ofgamma-ray emission from neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions ofcosmic-ray protons with the intra-cluster medium (icm). the derived upper limitof the cosmic-ray energy density within this framework is an order of magnitudehigher than that of our galaxy.

1005.5036	characterisation of the mopra radio telescope at 16--50 ghz	we present the results of a programme of scanning and mapping observations ofastronomical masers and jupiter designed to characterise the performance of themopra radio telescope at frequencies between 16-50 ghz using the 12-mm and 7-mmreceivers. we use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beamshape and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. we findthat the beam size is well fit by $\lambda$/$d$ over the frequency range with acorrelation coefficient of ~90%. we determine the telescope main beamefficiencies are between ~48-64% for the 12-mm receiver and reasonably flat at~50% for the 7-mm receiver. beam maps of strong h$_2$o (22 ghz) and sio masers(43 ghz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope.at both frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of threecomponents, a central `core', which is well fit by a gaussian and constitutesthe telescopes main beam, and inner and outer error beams. at both frequenciesthe inner and outer error beams extend out to approximately 2 and 3.4 times thefull-width half maximum of the main beam respectively. sources with angularsizes a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will coupleto the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the errorbeams needs to be considered. from measurements of the radial beam powerpattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and outer errorbeams is of order one-fifth at 22 ghz rising slightly to one-third at 43 ghz.

1104.0804	dual-frequency vlbi study of centaurus a on sub-parsec scales	centaurus a is the closest active galactic nucleus. high resolution imagingusing very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) enables us to study the spectraland kinematic behavior of the radio jet-counterjet system on sub-parsec scales,providing essential information for jet emission and formation models. our aimis to study the structure and spectral shape of the emission from thecentral-parsec region of cen a. as a target of the southern hemisphere vlbimonitoring program tanami (tracking active galactic nuclei with milliarcsecondinterferometry), vlbi observations of cen a are made regularly at 8.4 and 22.3ghz with the australian long baseline array (lba) and associated telescopes inantarctica, chile, and south africa. the first dual-frequency images of thissource are presented along with the resulting spectral index map. an angularresolution of 0.4 mas x 0.7 mas is achieved at 8.4 ghz, corresponding to alinear scale of less than 0.013 pc. hence, we obtain the highest resolutionvlbi image of cen a, comparable to previous space-vlbi observations. bycombining with the 22.3 ghz image, which has been taken without contributingtransoceanic baselines at somewhat lower resolution, we present thecorresponding dual-frequency spectral index distribution along the sub-parsecscale jet revealing the putative emission regions for recently detectedgamma-rays from the core region by fermi/lat. we resolve the innermoststructure of the milliarcsecond scale jet and counterjet system of cen a intodiscrete components. the simultaneous observations at two frequencies providethe highest resolved spectral index map of an agn jet allowing us to identifymultiple possible sites as the origin of the high energy emission.

1208.0039	noise in the cross-power spectrum of the vela pulsar	we compare the noise in interferometric measurements of the vela pulsar fromground- and space-based antennas with theoretical predictions. the noisedepends on both the flux density and the interferometric phase of the source.because the vela pulsar is bright and scintillating, these comparisons extendinto both the low and high signal-to-noise regimes. furthermore, our diversityof baselines explores the full range of variation in interferometric phase. wefind excellent agreement between theoretical expectations and our estimates ofnoise among samples within the characteristic scintillation scales. namely, thenoise is drawn from an elliptical gaussian distribution in the complex plane,centered on the signal. the major axis, aligned with the signal phase, variesquadratically with the signal, while the minor axis, at quadrature, varies withthe same linear coefficients. for weak signal, the noise approaches a circulargaussian distribution. both the variance and covariance of the noise are alsoaffected by artifacts of digitization and correlation. in particular, we showthat gating introduces correlations between nearby spectral channels.

1208.0040	size of the vela pulsar's emission region at 18 cm wavelength	we present measurements of the linear diameter of the emission region of thevela pulsar at observing wavelength lambda=18 cm. we infer the diameter as afunction of pulse phase from the distribution of visibility on themopra-tidbinbilla baseline. as we demonstrate, in the presence of strongscintillation, finite size of the emission region produces a characteristicw-shaped signature in the projection of the visibility distribution onto thereal axis. this modification involves heightened probability density near themean amplitude, decreased probability to either side, and a return to thezero-size distribution beyond. we observe this signature with high statisticalsignificance, as compared with the best-fitting zero-size model, in manyregions of pulse phase. we find that the equivalent full width at half maximumof the pulsar's emission region decreases from more than 400 km early in thepulse to near zero at the peak of the pulse, and then increases again toapproximately 800 km near the trailing edge. we discuss possible systematiceffects, and compare our work with previous results.

1402.0765	a state change in the low-mass x-ray binary xss j12270-4859	millisecond radio pulsars acquire their rapid rotation rates through mass andangular momentum transfer in a low-mass x-ray binary system. recent studies ofpsr j1824-2452i and psr j1023+0038 have observationally demonstrated this link,and they have also shown that such systems can repeatedly transitionback-and-forth between the radio millisecond pulsar and low-mass x-ray binarystates. this also suggests that a fraction of such systems are not newly bornradio millisecond pulsars but are rather suspended in a back-and-forth stateswitching phase, perhaps for giga-years. xss j12270-4859 has been previouslysuggested to be a low-mass x-ray binary, and until recently the only suchsystem to be seen at mev-gev energies. we present radio, optical and x-rayobservations that offer compelling evidence that xss j12270-4859 is a low-massx-ray binary which transitioned to a radio millisecond pulsar state between2012 november 14 and 2012 december 21. though radio pulsations remain to bedetected, we use optical and x-ray photometry/spectroscopy to show that thesystem has undergone a sudden dimming and no longer shows evidence for anaccretion disk. the optical observations constrain the orbital period to6.913+-0.002 hr.

1407.0162	tanami monitoring of centaurus a: the complex dynamics in the inner  parsec of an extragalactic jet	centaurus a is the closest radio-loud active galaxy. very long baselineinterferometry (vlbi) enables us to study the jet-counterjet system onmilliarcsecond (mas) scales, providing essential information for jet emissionand propagation models. we study the evolution of the central parsec jetstructure of cen a over 3.5 years. the proper motion analysis of individual jetcomponents allows us to constrain jet formation and propagation and to test theproposed correlation of increased high energy flux with jet ejection events.cen a is an exceptional laboratory for such detailed study as its proximitytranslates to unrivaled linear resolution, where 1 mas corresponds to 0.018 pc.the first 7 epochs of high-resolution tanami vlbi observations at 8 ghz of cena are presented, resolving the jet on (sub-)mas scales. they show adifferential motion of the sub-pc scale jet with significantly higher componentspeeds further downstream where the jet becomes optically thin. we determinedapparent component speeds within a range of 0.1c to 0.3c, as well as identifiedlong-term stable features. in combination with the jet-to-counterjet ratio wecan constrain the angle to the line of sight to ~12{\deg} to 45{\deg}. the highresolution kinematics are best explained by a spine-sheath structure supportedby the downstream acceleration occurring where the jet becomes optically thin.on top of the underlying, continuous flow, tanami observations clearly resolveindividual jet features. the flow appears to be interrupted by an obstaclecausing a local decrease in surface brightness and a circumfluent jet behavior.we propose a jet-star interaction scenario to explain this appearance. thecomparison of jet ejection times with high x-ray flux phases yields a partialoverlap of the onset of the x-ray emission and increasing jet activity, but thelimited data do not support a robust correlation.

1504.02165	identifying the source of perytons at the parkes radio telescope	"perytons" are millisecond-duration transients of terrestrial origin, whosefrequency-swept emission mimics the dispersion of an astrophysical pulse thathas propagated through tenuous cold plasma. in fact, their similarity to frb010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of "fast radiobursts," which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. until now, thephysical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. wehave identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 ghz associated withseveral peryton events. subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can begenerated at 1.4 ghz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and thetelescope is at an appropriate relative angle. radio emission escaping frommicrowave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of theobserved properties of the peryton signals. now that the peryton source hasbeen identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site couldnot have caused frb 010724. this and other distinct observational differencesshow that frbs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.

astro-ph;0402214	a search for tev gamma-ray emission from the psr b1259-63/ss2883 binary  system with the cangaroo-ii 10-m telescope	observations of the psr b1259-63/ss2883 binary system using the cangaroo-iicherenkov telescope are reported. this nearby binary consists of a 48msec radiopulsar in a highly eccentric orbit around a be star, and offers a uniquelaboratory to investigate the interactions between the outflows of the pulsarand be star at various distances. it has been pointed out that the relativisticpulsar wind and the dense mass outflow of the be star may result in theemission of gamma rays up to tev energies. we have observed the binary in 2000and 2001, 47 and 157 days after the october 2000 periastron. upper limits atthe 0.13--0.54 crab level are obtained. a new model calculation for high-energygamma-ray emission from the be star outflow is introduced and the estimatedgamma-ray flux considering bremsstrahlung, inverse compton scattering, and thedecay of neutral pions produced in proton-proton interactions, is found to becomparable to the upper limits of these observations. comparing our resultswith these model calculations, the mass-outflow parameters of the be star areconstrained.

astro-ph;0407010	new candidate ghz peaked spectrum and compact steep spectrum sources	data from a recent australia telescope compact array (atca) program ofmulti-frequency, multi-epoch monitoring of 202 active galactic nuclei withdeclinations &lt; +10 degrees have been searched for ghz peaked spectrum (gps) andcompact steep spectrum (css) radio sources. supplementary data at higher andlower frequencies, where available, have been used to further examine thespectral properties of previously reported and new candidate gps and csssources. the atca monitoring program has allowed the variability andpolarization properties of sources previously reported as gps and css sources,and the majority of new gps and css candidates, to be investigated, confirmingthat these are useful diagnostics in discriminating genuine gps and css sourcesfrom variable sources that display similar spectra only temporarily. gpssources are confirmed to be generally more compact, and less polarized, thancss sources, although css sources show evidence for being somewhat lessvariable than gps sources at 1.4 and 2.5ghz. in addition, the widths of gpsspectra are examined, and a significant difference is found in the gps sampleof snellen et al. (2000) between sources with compact double (cd) or compactsymmetric object (cso) morphologies and sources with other morphologies, inthat cd and cso sources have generally narrower spectra. possible reasons forthis difference are considered.

astro-ph;0407041	the vsop 5 ghz agn survey: iii. imaging results for the first 102  sources	the vsop mission is a japanese-led project to study radio sources withsub-milliarcsec resolution using an orbiting 8 m telescope, halca, along withglobal arrays of earth-based telescopes. approximately 25% of the observingtime is devoted to a survey of compact agn which are stronger than 1 jy at 5ghz-the vsop agn survey. this paper, the third in the series, presents theresults from the analysis of the first 102 survey sources. we present highresolution images and plots of visibility amplitude versus projected baselinelength. in addition, model-fit parameters to the primary radio components arelisted, and from these the angular size and brightness temperature for theradio cores are calculated. for those sources for which we were able todetermine the source frame core brightness temperature, a significant fraction(53 out of 98) have a source frame core brightness temperature in excess of10^12 k. the maximum source frame core brightness temperature we observed was1.2 x 10^13 k. explaining a brightness temperature this high requires anextreme amount of relativistic doppler beaming. since the maximum brightnesstemperature one is able to determine using only ground-based arrays is of theorder of 10^12 k, our results confirm the necessity of using space vlbi toexplore the extremely high brightness temperature regime.

astro-ph;0407069	the vsop 5-ghz agn survey: iv. the angular size/brightness temperature  distribution	the vsop (vlbi space observatory programme) mission is a japanese-led projectto study radio sources with sub-milliarcsec angular resolution, using anorbiting 8-m telescope on board the satellite halca with a global earth-basedarray of telescopes. a major program is the 5 ghz vsop survey program, which wesupplement here with vlba observations to produce a complete and flux-densitylimited sample. using statistical methods of analysis of the observedvisibility amplitude versus projected (u,v) spacing, we have determined theangular size and brightness temperature distribution of bright agn radio cores.on average, the cores have a diameter (full-width, half-power) of 0.20 maswhich contains about 20% of the total source emission, and (14+/-6)% of thecores are &lt;0.04 mas in size. about (20+/-5)% of the radio cores have a sourceframe brightness temperature 10^{13}k, and (3+/-2)% have 10^{14}k. a model ofthe high brightness temperature tail suggests that the radio cores have abrightness temperatures approx 10^{12}k, and are beamed toward the observerwith an average bulk motion of v/c=0.993 +/- 0.004.

astro-ph;0604480	the spectral energy distribution of pks 2004-447: a compact  steep-spectrum source and possible radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy	(abridged) the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the compact steepspectrum (css) source and possible radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy(nls1), pks2004-447, is presented. five out of six well studied rl nls1 sharethis dual classification (optically defined as a nls1 with radio definition ofa css or giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) source). the sed is created fromsimultaneous observations at radio (atca), optical/nir (siding spring) anduv/x-ray (xmm-newton) wavelengths. the x-ray data show evidence of short-termvariability, a possible soft excess, and negligible absorption. together withthe rest of the sed, the x-ray emission is excessive in comparison tosynchrotron plus synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models. the sed can bedescribed with a two component model consisting of extended synchrotron/sscemission with comptonisation in the x-rays, though ssc models with a very highelectron-to-magnetic energy density ratio cannot be excluded either. the peakemission in the sed appears to be in the near infrared, which can be attributedto thermal emission from a dusty torus. analysis of a non-contemporaneous, lowresolution optical spectrum suggests that the narrow-line region (nlr) is muchmore reddened than the x-ray emitting region suggesting that the gas-to-dustratio in pks2004-447 may be very different then in our own galaxy. long-termradio monitoring of pks2004-447 shows a rather constant light curve over nearlya six month period with the exception of one outburst when the 6.65ghz fluxincreased by ~35% over 19 days. in comparison to general samples of gpssources, which appear to be x-ray weak, nls1-css/gps sources possess strongerx-ray emission relative to radio, and lower intrinsic absorption than gpssources of similar x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;9710272	detection of gamma rays of up to 50 tev from the crab nebula	gamma rays with energies greater than 7 tev from the crab pulsar/nebula havebeen observed at large zenith angles, using the imaging atmospheric techniquefrom woomera, south australia. cangaroo data taken in 1992, 1993 and 1995indicate that the energy spectrum extends up to at least 50 tev, without achange of the index of the power law spectrum. the observed differentialspectrum is \noindent $(2.01\pm 0.36)\times 10^{-13}(e/{7 tev})^{-2.53 \pm0.18} tev^{-1}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ between 7 tev and 50 tev. there is no apparentcut-off. the spectrum for photon energies above $\sim$10 tev allows the maximumparticle acceleration energy to be inferred, and implies that this unpulsedemission does not originate near the light cylinder of the pulsar, but in thenebula where the magnetic field is not strong enough to allow pair creationfrom the tev photons. the hard gamma-ray energy spectrum above 10 tev alsoprovides information about the varying role of seed photons for the inversecompton process at these high energies, as well as a possible contribution of$\pi ^{\circ}$-gamma rays from proton collisions.

astro-ph;9801275	discovery of tev gamma rays from sn1006: further evidence for the snr  origin of cosmic rays	this paper reports the first discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from asupernova remnant made with the cangaroo 3.8 m telescope. tev gamma rays weredetected at the sky position and extension coincident with the north-east (ne)rim of shell-type supernova remnant (snr) sn1006 (type ia). sn1006 has been amost likely candidate for an extended tev gamma-ray source, since the clearsynchrotron x-ray emission from the rims was recently observed by asca (koyamaet al. 1995), which is a strong evidence of the existence of very high energyelectrons up to hundreds of tev in the snr. the observed tev gamma-ray flux was$(2.4\pm 0.5(statistical) \pm 0.7(systematic)) \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 3.0\pm 0.9$ tev) and $ (4.6\pm 0.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 1.7\pm 0.5$ tev) from the 1996 and 1997 observations,respectively. also we set an upper limit on the tev gamma-ray emission from thesw rim, estimated to be $ 1.1 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 1.7\pm0.5$ tev, 95% cl) in the 1997 data. the tev gamma rays can be attributed to the2.7 k cosmic background photons up-scattered by electrons of energies up toabout 10$^{14}$ ev by the inverse compton (ic) process. the observed flux ofthe tev gamma rays, together with that of the non-thermal x-rays, gives firmconstraints on the acceleration process in the snr shell; a magnetic field of$6.5\pm2$ $\mu$g is inferred from both the synchrotron x-rays and inversecompton tev gamma-rays, which gives entirely consistent mechanisms thatelectrons of energies up to 10$^{14}$ ev are produced via the shockacceleration in sn1006.

astro-ph;9906202	vsop and ground-based vlbi imaging of the tev blazar markarian 421 at  multiple epochs	we present thirty vlbi images of the tev blazar markarian 421 (1101+384) atfifteen epochs spanning the time range from 1994 to 1997, and at six differentfrequencies from 2.3 to 43 ghz. the imaged observations include ahigh-resolution 5 ghz vlbi space observatory programme (vsop) observation withthe halca satellite on 1997 november 14; full-track vlba observations from 1994april, 1996 november, and 1997 may at frequencies between 5 and 43 ghz; sixepochs of vlba snapshot observations at frequencies between 2 and 15 ghz fromradio reference frame studies; and five geodetic vlbi observations at 2 and 8ghz from the archive of the washington vlbi correlator facility located at theu.s. naval observatory. the dense time coverage of the images allows us tounambiguously track components in the parsec-scale jet over the observed timerange. we measure the speeds of three inner jet components located between 0.5and 5 mas from the core (0.3 to 3 pc projected linear distance) to be 0.19 +/-0.27, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and -0.07 +/- 0.07 c (h_{0}=65 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}). if thesole 43 ghz image is excluded, all measured speeds are consistent with nomotion. these speeds differ from tentative superluminal speeds measured byzhang &amp; b\aa\aa th from three epochs of data from the early 1980's. possibleinterpretations of these subluminal speeds in terms of the high doppler factordemanded by the tev variability of this source are discussed.

astro-ph;9907167	high resolution vsop imaging of a southern blazar pks 1921-293 at 1.6  ghz	we present a high resolution 1.6 ghz vsop image of the southern blazar pks1921-293. the image shows a typical core-jet morphology, consistent withground-based vlbi images. however, the addition of data from the space antennahas greatly improved the angular resolution (especially along the north-southdirection for this source), and thus allowed us to clearly identify the core.model fitting reveals an inner jet component ~1.5 mas north of the core. thisjet feature may be moving on a common curved path connecting the jet within afew parsecs to the 10-parsec-scale jet. the compact core has a brightnesstemperature of 2.6*10**12 k (in the rest frame of the quasar), an indication ofrelativistic beaming. we analyzed the source in terms of three models,involving the inverse compton catastrophe, an inhomogeneous relativistic jet,and the equipartition of energy between the radiating particles and themagnetic field. our analysis of this gamma-ray-quiet blazar shows no preferenceto any particular one of these models.
