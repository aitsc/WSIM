0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0905.0340	using spectral flux ratios to standardize sn ia luminosities	we present a new method to standardize type ia supernova (sn ia) luminositiesto ~&lt;0.13 magnitudes using flux ratios from a single flux-calibrated spectrumper sn. using nearby supernova factory spectrophotomery of 58 sne ia, weperformed an unbiased search for flux ratios which correlate with sn ialuminosity. after developing the method and selecting the best ratios from atraining sample, we verified the results on a separate validation sample andwith data from the literature. we identified multiple flux ratios whosecorrelations with luminosity are stronger than those of light curve shape andcolor, previously identified spectral feature ratios, or equivalent widthmeasurements. in particular, the flux ratio r(642/443) = f(642 nm) / f(443 nm)has a correlation of 0.95 with sn ia absolute magnitudes. using this singleratio as a correction factor produces a hubble diagram with a residual scatterstandard deviation of 0.125 +- 0.011 mag, compared with 0.161 +- 0.015 mag whenfit with the salt2 light curve shape and color parameters x1 and c. the ratior(642/443) is an effective correction factor for both extrinsic dust reddeningand instrinsic variations such as those of sn 1991t-like and sn 1999aa-likesne. when combined with broad-band color measurements, spectral flux ratios canstandardize sn ia magnitudes to ~0.12 mag. these are the first spectral metricsthat improve over the standard normalization methods based upon light curveshape and color and they provide among the lowest scatter hubble diagrams everpublished.

0906.4318	constraining dust and color variations of high-z sne using nicmos on  hubble space telescope	we present data from the supernova cosmology project for five high redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) that were obtained using the nicmos infrared cameraon the hubble space telescope. we add two sne from this sample to a rest-framei-band hubble diagram, doubling the number of high redshift supernovae on thisdiagram. this i-band hubble diagram is consistent with a flat universe(omega_matter, omega_lambda= 0.29, 0.71). a homogeneous distribution of largegrain dust in the intergalactic medium (replenishing dust) is incompatible withthe data and is excluded at the 5 sigma confidence level, if the sn host galaxyreddening is corrected assuming r_v=1.75. we use both optical and infraredobservations to compare photometric properties of distant sne ia with those ofnearby objects. we find generally good agreement with the expected colorevolution for all sne except the highest redshift sn in our sample (sn 1997ekat z=0.863) which shows a peculiar color behavior. we also present spectraobtained from ground based telescopes for type identification and determinationof redshift.

1003.2217	nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2007if: first total mass  measurement of a super-chandrasekhar-mass progenitor	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2007if, anoverluminous (m_v = -20.4), red (b-v = 0.16 at b-band maximum), slow-rising(t_rise = 24 days) type ia supernova in a very faint (m_g = -14.10) hostgalaxy. a spectrum at 5 days past b-band maximum light is a direct match to thesuper-chandrasekhar-mass candidate sn ia 2003fg, showing si ii and c ii at~9000 km/s. a high signal-to-noise co-addition of the sn spectral time seriesreveals no na i d absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the hostgalaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the lirarelation for normal sne ia. the ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strongmaximum in i-band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing innear-maximum-light spectra. sn2007 if also displays a plateau in the si iivelocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for anoverdense shell in the sn ejecta. we calculate the bolometric light curve ofthe sn and use it and the \ion{si}{2} velocity evolution to constrain the massof the shell and the underlying sn ejecta, and demonstrate that sn2007 if isstrongly inconsistent with a chandrasekhar-mass scenario. within the context ofa "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, andassuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4+/- 0.2 solar masses, with 1.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of nickel-56 and with0.3-0.5 solar masses in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. ourmodeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a moreefficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the lowvelocities typical of super-chandrasekhar-mass sneia.

1008.2308	supernova legacy survey: using spectral signatures to improve type ia  supernovae as distance indicators	gmos optical long-slit spectroscopy at the gemini-north telescope was used toclassify targets from the supernova legacy survey (snls) from july 2005 and may2006 - may 2008. during this time, 95 objects were observed. where possible theobjects' redshifts (z) were measured from narrow emission or absorptionfeatures in the host galaxy spectrum, otherwise they were measured from thebroader supernova features. we present spectra of 68 confirmed or probable sneia from snls with redshifts in the range 0.17 \leq z \leq 1.02. in combinationwith earlier snls gemini and vlt spectra, we used these new observations tomeasure pseudo-equivalent widths (ews) of three spectral features - caii h&amp;k,siii and mgii - in 144 objects and compared them to the ews of low-redshift sneia from a sample drawn from the literature. no signs of changes with z are seenfor the caii h&amp;k and mgii features. systematically lower ew siii is seen athigh redshift, but this can be explained by a change in demographics of the sneia population within a two-component model combined with an observedcorrelation between ew siii and photometric lightcurve stretch.

1010.5786	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: ii. the type ia  supernova rate in high-redshift galaxy clusters	we report a measurement of the type ia supernova (sn ia) rate in galaxyclusters at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.45 from the hubble space telescope (hst) clustersupernova survey. this is the first cluster sn ia rate measurement withdetected z &gt; 0.9 sne. finding 8 +/- 1 cluster sne ia, we determine a sn ia rateof 0.50 +0.23-0.19 (stat) +0.10-0.09 (sys) snub (snub = 10^-12 sne l_{sun,b}^-1yr^-1). in units of stellar mass, this translates to 0.36 +0.16-0.13 (stat)+0.07-0.06 (sys) snum (snum = 10^-12 sne m_sun^-1 yr^-1). this represents afactor of approximately 5 +/- 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rateat z &lt; 0.2. we parameterize the late-time sn ia delay time distribution with apower law (proportional to t^s). under the assumption of a cluster formationredshift of z_f = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshiftcluster sn ia rates constrains s = -1.41 +0.47/-0.40, consistent withmeasurements of the delay time distribution in the field. this measurement isgenerally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario andinconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting asteeper delay time distribution at large delay times. we check forenvironmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations bycalculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and inmorphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the fullcluster rate. finally, the upper limit of one host-less cluster sn ia detectedin the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium isless than 0.47 (95% confidence), consistent with measurements at lowerredshifts.

1103.5300	the reddening law of type ia supernovae: separating intrinsic  variability from dust using equivalent widths	we employ 76 type ia supernovae with optical spectrophotometry within 2.5days of b-band maximum light obtained by the nearby supernova factory to derivethe impact of si and ca features on supernovae intrinsic luminosity anddetermine a dust reddening law. we use the equivalent width of si ii{\lambda}4131 in place of light curve stretch to account for first-orderintrinsic luminosity variability. the resultant empirical spectral reddeninglaw exhibits strong features associated with ca ii and si ii {\lambda}6355.after applying a correction based on the ca ii h&amp;k equivalent width we find areddening law consistent with a cardelli extinction law. using the same inputdata, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame ubvri-like photometry inorder to mimic literature observations. after corrections for signaturescorrelated with si ii {\lambda}4131 and ca ii h&amp;k equivalent widths, andintroducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dustcomponent in each band. we find a value of the total-to-selective extinctionratio, rv = 2.8 \pm 0.3. this agrees with the milky way value, in contrast tothe low rv values found in most previous analyses. this result suggests thatthe long-standing controversy in interpreting sn ia colors and theircompatibility with a classical extinction law, critical to their use ascosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion incolors, and by the variability of features apparent in sn ia spectra.

1105.3470	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: v. improving the  dark energy constraints above z&gt;1 and building an early-type-hosted supernova  sample	we present acs, nicmos, and keck ao-assisted photometry of 20 type iasupernovae sne ia from the hst cluster supernova survey. the sne ia werediscovered over the redshift interval 0.623 &lt; z &lt; 1.415. fourteen of these sneia pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world'ssample of sne ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. ten ofour new sne ia are beyond redshift $z=1$, thereby nearly doubling thestatistical weight of hst-discovered sne ia beyond this redshift. our detailedanalysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between sn ialuminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the nicmos zeropoint at the countrates appropriate for very distant sne ia. adding these supernovae improves thebest combined constraint on the dark energy density \rho_{de}(z) at redshifts1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 by 18% (including systematic errors). for a lambdacdm universe,we find \omega_\lambda = 0.724 +0.015/-0.016 (68% cl including systematicerrors). for a flat wcdm model, we measure a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter w = -0.985 +0.071/-0.077 (68% cl). curvature isconstrained to ~0.7% in the owcdm model and to ~2% in a model in which darkenergy is allowed to vary with parameters w_0 and w_a. tightening further theconstraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require severalimprovements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample ofseveral dozen z&gt;1 sne ia. we describe how such a sample could be efficientlyobtained by targeting cluster fields with wfc3 on hst.

1107.3564	the nature of double-peaked [o iii] active galactic nuclei	active galactic nuclei (agns) with double-peaked [o iii] lines are suspectedto be sub-kpc or kpc-scale binary agns. however, pure gas kinematics canproduce the same double-peaked line profile in spatially integrated spectra.here we combine integral-field spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging of 42double-peaked [o iii] agns from sloan digital sky survey to investigate theconstituents of the population. we find two binary agns where theline-splitting is driven by the orbital motion of the merging nuclei. suchobjects account for only ~2% of the double-peaked agns. almost all (~98%) ofthe double-peaked agns were selected because of gas kinematics; and half ofthose show spatially resolved narrow-line regions that extend 4-20 kpc from thenuclei. serendipitously, we find two spectrally unresolved binary agns wheregas kinematics produced the double-peaked [o iii] lines. the relativelyfrequent serendipitous discoveries indicate that only ~1% of binary agns wouldappear double-peaked in sloan spectra and 2.2_{-0.8}^{+2.5}% of all sloan agnsare binary agns. therefore, the double-peaked sample does not offer muchadvantage over any other agn samples in finding binary agns. the binary agnfraction implies an elevated agn duty cycle (8_{-3}^{+8}%), suggesting galaxyinteractions enhance nuclear accretion. we illustrate that integral-fieldspectroscopy is crucial for identifying binary agns: several objects previouslyclassified as "binary agns" with long-slit spectra are most likely single agnswith extended narrow-line regions. the formation of extended narrow-lineregions driven by radiation pressure is also discussed.

1109.1312	type ia supernova carbon footprints	we present convincing evidence of unburned carbon at photospheric velocitiesin new observations of 5 type ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained by the nearbysupernova factory. these sne are identified by examining 346 spectra from 124sne obtained before +2.5 d relative to maximum. detections are based on thepresence of relatively strong c ii 6580 absorption "notches" in multiplespectra of each sn, aided by automated fitting with the synapps code. four ofthe 5 sne in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ionsand ejection velocities typical of sne ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibitshigh-velocity (v &gt; 20,000 km/s) si ii and ca ii features. on the other hand,the light curve properties are preferentially grouped, strongly suggesting aconnection between carbon-positivity and broad band light curve/color behavior:three of the 5 have relatively narrow light curves but also blue colors, and afourth may be a dust-reddened member of this family. accounting forsignal-to-noise and phase, we estimate that 22 +10/-6% of sne ia exhibitspectroscopic c ii signatures as late as -5 d with respect to maximum. we placethese new objects in the context of previously recognized carbon-positive sneia, and consider reasonable scenarios seeking to explain a physical connectionbetween light curve properties and the presence of photospheric carbon. we alsoexamine the detailed evolution of the detected carbon signatures and thesurrounding wavelength regions to shed light on the distribution of carbon inthe ejecta. our ability to reconstruct the c ii 6580 feature in detail underthe assumption of purely spherical symmetry casts doubt on a "carbon blobs"hypothesis, but does not rule out all asymmetric models. a low volume fillingfactor for carbon, combined with line-of-sight effects, seems unlikely toexplain the scarcity of detected carbon in sne ia by itself.

0710.3120	a new determination of the high redshift type ia supernova rates with  the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys	we present a new measurement of the volumetric rate of type ia supernova upto a redshift of 1.7, using the hubble space telescope (hst) goods datacombined with an additional hst dataset covering the north goods fieldcollected in 2004. we employ a novel technique that does not requirespectroscopic data for identifying type ia supernovae (although spectroscopicmeasurements of redshifts are used for over half the sample); instead we employa bayesian approach using only photometric data to calculate the probabilitythat an object is a type ia supernova. this bayesian technique can easily bemodified to incorporate improved priors on supernova properties, and it iswell-suited for future high-statistics supernovae searches in whichspectroscopic follow up of all candidates will be impractical. here, the methodis validated on both ground- and space-based supernova data having somespectroscopic follow up. we combine our volumetric rate measurements with lowredshift supernova data, and fit to a number of possible models for theevolution of the type ia supernova rate as a function of redshift. the data donot distinguish between a flat rate at redshift &gt; 0.5 and a previously proposedmodel, in which the type ia rate peaks at redshift &gt;1 due to a significantdelay from star-formation to the supernova explosion. except for the highestredshifts, where the signal to noise ratio is generally too low to apply thistechnique, this approach yields smaller or comparable uncertainties thanprevious work.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

1203.4839	constraining type ia supernova models: sn 2011fe as a test case	the nearby supernova sn 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail.therefore, it is an important test case for type ia supernova (sn ia) models,which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of theseobjects. here, we explore how available and expected future observations of sn2011fe can be used to constrain sn ia explosion scenarios. we base ourdiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two whitedwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the mostwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to sne ia. althoughboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early andnear-maximum spectra of sn 2011fe obtained by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. the levelof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating theexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leadsto differences in the 55co production. sn 2011fe is close enough to be followedsufficiently long to study this effect.

1309.1182	evidence of environmental dependencies of type ia supernovae from the  nearby supernova factory indicated by local h{\alpha}	(abridged) we study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to type iasupernovae (sne ia) to analyze relations between the properties of sn ia eventsand environments most similar to where their progenitors formed. we focus onlocal h\alpha\ emission as an indicator of young environments. the nearbysupernova factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for sne iausing integral field spectroscopy, allowing the simultaneous measurement of thesn and its immediate vicinity. for 89 sne ia we measure h\alpha\ emissiontracing ongoing star formation within a 1 kpc radius around each sn. thisconstitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sampleof sne ia also having accurate luminosity, color and stretch measurements. wefind that sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission are redder by 0.036+/-0.017 mag,and that the previously-noted correlation between stretch and host mass isentirely driven by the sne ia coming from passive regions. most importantly,the mean standardized brightness for sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission is0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. this offset arises from abimodal structure in the hubble residuals, that also explains thepreviously-known host-mass bias. we combine this bimodality with the cosmicstar-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean sn iabrightness and the host-mass bias. this change is confirmed using high-redshiftsne ia from the literature. these environmental dependences point to remainingsystematic errors in sne ia standardization. the observed brightness offset ispredicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energyequation of state. recognition of these effects offers new opportunities toimprove sne ia as cosmological probes - e.g. sne ia having local h\alpha\emission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012mag.

1401.3352	type ia supernova hubble residuals and host-galaxy properties	kim et al. (2013) [k13] introduced a new methodology for determiningpeak-brightness absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae from multi-band lightcurves. we examine the relation between their parameterization of light curvesand hubble residuals, based on photometry synthesized from the nearby supernovafactory spectrophotometric time series, with global host-galaxy properties. thek13 hubble residual step with host mass is $0.013\pm 0.031$ mag for a supernovasubsample with data coverage corresponding to the k13 training; at $\ll1\sigma$, the step is not significant and lower than previous measurements.relaxing the data coverage requirement the hubble residual step with host massis $0.045\pm 0.026$ mag for the larger sample; a calculation using the modes ofthe distributions, less sensitive to outliers, yields a step of 0.019 mag. theanalysis of this article uses k13 inferred luminosities, as distinguished fromprevious works that use magnitude corrections as a function of salt2 color andstretch parameters: steps at $&gt;2\sigma $ significance are found in salt2 hubbleresiduals in samples split by the values of their k13 $x(1)$ and $x(2)$light-curve parameters. $x(1)$ affects the light-curve width and color aroundpeak (similar to the $\delta m_{15}$ and stretch parameters), and $x(2)$affects colors, the near-uv light-curve width, and the light-curve decline 20to 30 days after peak brightness. the novel light-curve analysis, increasedparameter set, and magnitude corrections of k13 may be capturing features ofsn~ia diversity arising from progenitor stellar evolution.

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

1412.5533	type ia supernova distance modulus bias and dispersion from k-correction  errors: a direct measurement using lightcurve fits to observed spectral time  series	we estimate systematic errors due to k-corrections in standard photometricanalyses of high redshift type ia supernovae. errors due to k-correction occurwhen the spectral template model underlying the lightcurve fitter poorlyrepresents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that thedistance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. in order to quantify thiseffect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshiftedspectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the nearbysupernova factory, and the resulting lightcurves are fit with a conventionallightcurve fitter. we measure the variation in the standardized magnitude thatwould be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts andobserved with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernovasurveys. we find significant variation in the measurements of the samesupernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, whichcauses dispersion greater than $\sim0.05$ mag for measurements of photometryusing the sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a $0.03$ shift in$w$ when applied to an outside data set. to test the result of a shift insupernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat ourcalculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a functionof redshift and find that this strongly affects the results and would haverepercussions for cosmology. we discuss possible methods to reduce thecontribution of the k-correction bias and uncertainty.

1412.6501	confirmation of a star formation bias in type ia supernova distances and  its effect on measurement of the hubble constant	previously we used the nearby supernova factory sample to show that sne~iahaving locally star-forming environments are dimmer than sne~ia having locallypassive environments.here we use the \constitution\ sample together with hostgalaxy data from \galex\ to independently confirm that result. the effect isseen using both the salt2 and mlcs2k2 lightcurve fitting and standardizationmethods, with brightness differences of $0.094 \pm 0.037\ \mathrm{mag}$ forsalt2 and $0.155 \pm 0.041\ \mathrm{mag}$ for mlcs2k2 with $r_v=2.5$. whencombined with our previous measurement the effect is $0.094 \pm 0.025\\mathrm{mag}$ for salt2. if the ratio of these local sn~ia environments changeswith redshift or sample selection, this can lead to a bias in cosmologicalmeasurements. we explore this issue further, using as an example the directmeasurement of $h_0$. \galex{} observations show that the sne~ia havingstandardized absolute magnitudes calibrated via the cepheid period--luminosityrelation using {\textit{hst}} originate in predominately star-formingenvironments, whereas only ~50% of the hubble-flow comparison sample havelocally star-forming environments. as a consequence, the $h_0$ measurementusing sne~ia is currently overestimated. correcting for this bias, we find avalue of $h_0^{corr}=70.6\pm 2.6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ mpc^{-1}}$ when using thelmc distance, milky way parallaxes and the ngc~4258 megamaser as the cepheidzeropoint, and $68.8\pm 3.3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ mpc^{-1}}$ when only usingngc~4258. our correction brings the direct measurement of $h_0$ within $\sim1\,\sigma$ of recent indirect measurements based on the cmb power spectrum.

1502.01026	a calibration of nicmos camera 2 for low count-rates	nicmos 2 observations are crucial for constraining distances to most of theexisting sample of z &gt; 1 sne ia. unlike the conventional calibration programs,these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. reciprocityfailure is known to exist in hgcdte devices and a correction for this effecthas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. howeverobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. here instead, weprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. thisis obtained via inter-calibration of nic2 f110w/f160w with wfc3 in the lowcount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.these objects have relatively simple near-ir seds, uniform colors, and theirextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate thanwould stars. the use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on psfprofiles. we find st magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the nicmoscooling system, ncs) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for f110w and 25.803 +- 0.023 forf160w, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). before the installation of the ncs, wefind 24.843 +- 0.025 for f110w and 25.498 +- 0.021 for f160w, also in agreementwith the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). we also check thestandard bandpasses of wfc3 and nicmos 2 using a range of stars and galaxies atdifferent colors and find mild tension for wfc3, limiting the accuracy of thezeropoints. to avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was "blinded" in thatthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

1511.01102	improving cosmological distance measurements using twin type ia  supernovae	we introduce a method for identifying "twin" type ia supernovae, and usingthem to improve distance measurements. this novel approach to type ia supernovastandardization is made possible by spectrophotometric time series observationsfrom the nearby supernova factory (snfactory). we begin with a well-measuredset of supernovae, find pairs whose spectra match well across the entireoptical window, and then test whether this leads to a smaller dispersion intheir absolute brightnesses. this analysis is completed in a blinded fashion,ensuring that decisions made in implementing the method do not inadvertentlybias the result. we find that pairs of supernovae with more closely matchedspectra indeed have reduced brightness dispersion. we are able to standardizethis initial set of snfactory supernovae to 0.083 +/- 0.012 magnitudes,implying a dispersion of 0.072 +/- 0.010 magnitudes in the absence of peculiarvelocities. we estimate that with larger numbers of comparison sne, e.g, usingthe final snfactory spectrophotometric dataset as a reference, this method willbe capable of standardizing high-redshift supernovae to within 0.06-0.07magnitudes. these results imply that at least 3/4 of the variance in hubbleresiduals in current supernova cosmology analyses is due to previouslyunaccounted-for astrophysical differences among the supernovae

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0507288	spectroscopic observations and analysis of the unusual type ia sn 1999ac	we present optical spectra of the peculiar type ia supernova (sn ia) 1999ac.the data extend from -15 to +42 days with respect to b-band maximum and revealan event that is unusual in several respects. prior to b-band maximum, thespectra resemble those of sn 1999aa, a slowly declining event, but possessstronger siii and caii signatures (more characteristic of a spectroscopicallynormal sn). spectra after b-band maximum appear more normal. the expansionvelocities inferred from the iron lines appear to be lower than average;whereas, the expansion velocity inferred from calcium h and k are higher thanaverage. the expansion velocities inferred from siii are among the slowest everobserved, though sn 1999ac is not particularly dim. the analysis of theparameters v_10, r(siii), dv(siii)/dt, and d_m15 further underlines the uniquecharacteristics of sn 1999ac. we find convincing evidence of cii 6580 in theday -15 spectrum with ejection velocity v &gt; 16,000 km/s, but this signaturedisappears by day -9. this rapid evolution at early times highlights theimportance of extremely early-time spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0509041	spectra of high-redshift type ia supernovae and a comparison with their  low-redshift counterparts	we present spectra for 14 high-redshift (0.17 &lt; z &lt; 0.83) supernovae, whichwere discovered by the supernova cosmology project as part of a campaign tomeasure cosmological parameters. the spectra are used to determine the redshiftand classify the supernova type, essential information if the supernovae are tobe used for cosmological studies. redshifts were derived either from thespectrum of the host galaxy or from the spectrum of the supernova itself. wepresent evidence that these supernovae are of type ia by matching to spectra ofnearby supernovae. we find that the dates of the spectra relative to maximumlight determined from this fitting process are consistent with the datesdetermined from the photometric light curves, and moreover the spectraltime-sequence for sne type ia at low and high redshift is indistinguishable. wealso show that the expansion velocities measured from blueshifted cahk areconsistent with those measured for low-redshift type ia supernovae. from thesefirst-level quantitative comparisons we find no evidence for evolution in sniaproperties between these low- and high-redshift samples. thus even though oursamples may not be complete, we conclude that there is a population of sne iaat high redshift whose spectral properties match those at low redshift.

astro-ph;0510447	the supernova legacy survey: measurement of omega_m, omega_lambda and w  from the first year data set	we present distance measurements to 71 high redshift type ia supernovaediscovered during the first year of the 5-year supernova legacy survey (snls).these events were detected and their multi-color light-curves measured usingthe megaprime/megacam instrument at the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht),by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. follow-upspectroscopy was performed at the vlt, gemini and keck telescopes to confirmthe nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. with this data set,we have built a hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurementsinvolving at least two bands. systematic uncertainties are evaluated making useof the multi-band photometry obtained at cfht. cosmological fits to this firstyear snls hubble diagram give the following results : omega_m = 0.263 +/-0.042(stat) +/- 0.032(sys) for a flat lambdacdm model; and w = -1.023 +/-0.090(stat) +/- 0.054(sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of statew when combined with the constraint from the recent sloan digital sky surveymeasurement of baryon acoustic oscillations.

astro-ph;0510857	photometric selection of high-redshift type ia supernovae	we present a method for selecting high-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)located via rolling sn searches. the technique, using both color and magnitudeinformation of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,is able to discriminate between sne ia and core collapse sne. furthermore, forthe sne ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curveparameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. wedemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of sne iaand core-collapse sne, where the selection method effectively rejects mostcore-collapse sne while retaining sne ia. we also apply the selection code toreal-time data acquired as part of the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey (snls). during the period may 2004 to january 2005 in the snls,440 sn candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopicallyas sne ia and 15 as core-collapse events. for this test dataset, the selectiontechnique correctly identifies 100% of the identified sne ii as non-sne ia withonly a 1-2% false rejection rate. the predicted parameterization of the sne iahas a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)&lt;0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planningspectroscopic follow-up observations. we also investigate any bias introducedby this selection method on the ability of surveys such as snls to measurecosmological parameters (e.g., w and omega matter), and find any effect to benegligible.

astro-ph;0512081	grb 050408: an atypical gamma-ray burst as a probe of an atypical  galactic environment	the bright grb 050408 was localized by hete-ii near local midnight, enablingan impressive ground-based followup effort as well as space-based followup fromswift. the swift data from the x-ray telescope (xrt) and our own opticalphotometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for ouranalysis. under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was abovethe peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the opticalphotometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to anelectron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggestedby others. a break is seen in the x-ray data at early times (at ~12600 secafter the grb). the spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent withp_lc assuming a host-galaxy extinction of a_v = 1.18 mag. the optical-nirbroadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers a_v = 0.57mag. the x-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be theresult of a refreshed shock. this burst stands out in that the optical andx-ray data suggest a large h i column density of n_hi ~ 10^22 cm^-2; it is verylikely a damped lyman alpha system and so the faintness of the host galaxy (m_v&gt; -18 mag) is noteworthy. moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong ti iiabsorption lines with a column density through the grb host that exceeds thelargest values observed for the milky way by an order of magnitude.furthermore, the ti ii equivalent width is in the top 1% of mg iiabsorption-selected qsos. this suggests that the large-scale environment of grb050408 has significantly lower ti depletion than the milky way and a largevelocity width (delta v &gt; 200 km/s).

astro-ph;0602411	measurement of \omega_m, \omega_{\lambda} from a blind analysis of type  ia supernovae with cmagic: using color information to verify the acceleration  of the universe	we present measurements of \omega_m and \omega_{\lambda} from a blindanalysis of 21 high-redshift supernovae using a new technique (cmagic) forfitting the multi-color lightcurves of type ia supernovae, first introduced inwang et al. (2003). cmagic takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior oftype ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages overcurrent techniques based on maximum magnitudes. among these are a reducedsensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-widthrelation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. this allows usto provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite thefact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for cmagic.we describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the data are broadly consistent with the picture ofan accelerating universe, and agree with a flat universe within 1.7\sigma,including systematics. we also compare the cmagic results directly with thoseof a maximum magnitude fit to the same sne, finding that cmagic favors moreacceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlationbetween the two measurements. a fit for w assuming a flat universe yields avalue which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.

astro-ph;0605148	the type ia supernova rate at z ~0.5 from the supernova legacy survey	we present a measurement of the distant type ia supernova rate derived fromthe first two years of the canada -- france -- hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey. we observed four one-square degree fields with a typicaltemporal frequency of &lt;delta t&gt; ~ 4 observer-frame days over time spans of from158 to 211 days per season for each field, with breaks during full moon. weused 8-10 meter-class telescopes for spectroscopic followup to confirm ourcandidates and determine their redshifts. our starting sample consists of 73spectroscopically verified type ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt;0.6. we derive a volumetric sn ia rate of r_v(&lt;z&gt;=0.47) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.09}(systematic) +- 0.06 (statistical) x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^3, assuming h = 0.7,omega_m = 0.3 and a flat cosmology. using recently published galaxy luminosityfunctions derived in our redshift range, we derive a sn ia rate per unitluminosity of r_l(&lt;z&gt;=0.47) = 0.154^{+0.048}_{-0.033} (systematic)^{+0.039}_{-0.031} (statistical) snu. using our rate alone, we place an upperlimit on the component of sn ia production that tracks the cosmic starformation history of 1 sn ia per 10^3 m_sun of stars formed. our rate and otherrates from surveys using spectroscopic sample confirmation display only amodest evolution out to z=0.55.

astro-ph;0606499	nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2005gj: another type ia  supernova in a massive circumstellar envelope	we report nearby supernova factory observations of sn 2005gj, the secondconfirmed case of a "hybrid" type ia/iin supernova. our early-phase photometryof sn 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for theprototype, sn 2002ic. our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad andnarrow h-alpha emission. later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst,show clear type ia features combined with broad and narrow h-gamma, h-beta,h-alpha and hei 5876,7065 in emission. at higher resolution, p cygni profilesare apparent. surprisingly, we also observe an inverted p cygni profile for[oiii] 5007. we find that the lightcurve and measured velocity of the unshockedcircumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. the earlylightcurve is well-described by a flat radial density profile for thecircumstellar material. however, our decomposition of the spectra into type iaand shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova,suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material.we suggest that the emission line velocity profiles arise from electronscattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. this is supported by theinferred high densities, and the lack of evidence for evolution in the linewidths. ground- and space-based photometry, and keck spectroscopy, of the hostgalaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity z/zsun &lt;0.3; (95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant starformation event that began roughly 200+/-70 myr ago. we discuss theimplications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology usingtype ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0608029	on the progenitor of sn 2005gl and the nature of type iin supernovae	we present a study of the type iin supernova (sn) 2005gl, in the relativelynearby (d~66 mpc) galaxy ngc 266. photometry and spectroscopy of the snindicate it is a typical member of its class. pre-explosion hubble spacetelescope (hst) imaging of the location of the sn, along with a preciselocalization of this event using the laser-guide-star assisted adaptive optics(lgs-ao) system at keck observatory, are combined to identify a luminous(m_v=-10.3) point source as the possible progenitor of sn 2005gl. if the sourceis indeed a single star, it was likely a member of the class of luminous bluevariable stars (lbvs). this finding leads us to consider the possible generalassociation of sne iin with lbv progenitors. we find this is indeed supportedby observations of other sne, and the known properties of lbv stars. forexample, we argue that should the prototypical galactic lbv eta carina explodein a phase similar to its current state, it will likely produce a type iin sn.we discuss our findings in the context of current ideas about the evolution ofmassive stars, and review the census of sne with identified progenitors. weintroduce the concept of the progenitor-sn map as a convenient means to discussthe present status and future prospects of direct searches for sn progenitors.we conclude that this field has matured considerably in recent years, and thetransition from anecdotal information about rare single events to robustassociations of progenitor classes with specific sn types has already begun.

astro-ph;9712212	discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe and  its cosmological implications	the ultimate fate of the universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can bedetermined by measuring the redshifts, apparent brightnesses, and intrinsicluminosities of very distant supernovae. recent developments have providedtools that make such a program practicable: (1) studies of relatively nearbytype ia supernovae (sne ia) have shown that their intrinsic luminosities can beaccurately determined; (2) new research techniques have made it possible toschedule the discovery and follow-up observations of distant supernovae,producing well over 50 very distant (z = 0.3 -- 0.7) sne ia to date. thesedistant supernovae provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over thepast several billion years. by making precise measurements of supernovae atstill greater distances, and thus extending this expansion history back farenough in time, we can distinguish the slowing caused by the gravitationalattraction of the universe's mass density omega_m from the effect of a possiblyinflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant lambda. we report herethe first such measurements, with our discovery of a type ia supernova (sn1997ap) at z = 0.83. measurements at the keck ii 10-m telescope make this themost distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. over two months ofphotometry of sn 1997ap with the hubble space telescope and ground-basedtelescopes, when combined with previous measurements of nearer sne ia, suggeststhat we may live in a low mass-density universe. further supernovae atcomparable distances are currently scheduled for ground and space-basedobservations.

astro-ph;9812133	measurements of omega and lambda from 42 high-redshift supernovae	we report measurements of the mass density, omega_m, andcosmological-constant energy density, omega_lambda, of the universe based onthe analysis of 42 type ia supernovae discovered by the supernova cosmologyproject. the magnitude-redshift data for these sne, at redshifts between 0.18and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of sne from the calan/tololo supernovasurvey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmologicalparameters. all sn peak magnitudes are standardized using a sn ia lightcurvewidth-luminosity relation. the measurement yields a joint probabilitydistribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by therelation 0.8 omega_m - 0.6 omega_lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region ofinterest (omega_m &lt;~ 1.5). for a flat (omega_m + omega_lambda = 1) cosmology wefind omega_m = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04}(identified systematics). the data are strongly inconsistent with a lambda = 0flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. an open, lambda = 0cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that thecosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of p(lambda &gt;0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. the best-fit ageof the universe relative to the hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h)gyr for a flat cosmology. the size of our sample allows us to perform a varietyof statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. wefind no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution ormalmquist bias between the low-redshift calan/tololo sample and ourhigh-redshift sample. the conclusions are robust whether or not awidth-luminosity relation is used to standardize the sn peak magnitudes.
