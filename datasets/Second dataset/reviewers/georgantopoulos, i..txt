0903.0131	alternative high-z cosmic tracers and the dark energy equation of state	we propose to use alternative cosmic tracers to measure the dark energyequation of state and the matter content of the universe [w(z) &amp; \omega_m]. ourproposed method consists of two components: (a) tracing the hubble relationusing hii-like starburst galaxies, as an alternative to snia, which can bedetected up to very large redshifts, z~4, and (b) measuring the clusteringpattern of x-ray selected agn at a median redshift of ~1. each component of themethod can in itself provide interesting constraints on the cosmologicalparameters, especially under our anticipation that we will reduce thecorresponding random and systematic errors significantly. however, by joiningtheir likelihood functions we will be able to put stringent cosmologicalconstraints and break the known degeneracies between the dark energy equationof state (whether it is constant or variable) and the matter content of theuniverse and provide a powerful and alternative rute to measure thecontribution to the global dynamics, and the equation of state, of dark energy.a preliminary joint analysis of x-ray selected agn (based on a small xmmsurvey) and the currently largest snia sample (kowalski et al 2008), provides:omega_m=0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.04} and w=-1.0 +-0.1.

0904.3459	xmm-newton observations of seyfert galaxies from the palomar  spectroscopic survey: the x-ray absorption distribution	we present xmm-newton spectral analysis of all 38 seyfert galaxies from thepalomar spectroscopic sample of galaxies. these are found at distances of up to67 mpc and cover the absorbed 2-10 kev luminosity range ~10^38-10^43 ergs/s.our aim is to determine the distribution of the x-ray absorption in the localuniverse. three of these are compton-thick with column densities just above10^24 cm^-2 and high equivalent width feka lines (&gt;700 ev). five more sourceshave low values of the x-ray to [oiii] flux ratio suggesting that they could beassociated with obscured nuclei. their individual spectra show neither highabsorbing columns nor flat spectral indices. however, their stacked spectrumreveals an absorbing column density of n_h~10^23 cm^-2. therefore the fractionof absorbed sources (&gt;10^22 cm^-2 could be as high as 55+/-12%. a number ofseyfert-2 appear to host unabsorbed nuclei. these are associated withlow-luminosity sources lx &lt; 3x10^41 ergs/s. their stacked spectrum again showsno absorption while inspection of the \chandra images, where available, showsthat contamination from nearby sources does not affect the {\it xmm-newton}spectra in most cases. nevertheless, such low luminosity sources are notcontributing significantly to the x-ray background flux. when we consider onlythe brighter, $&gt;10^{41}$ \lunits, 21 sources, we find that the fraction ofabsorbed nuclei rises to $75\pm19 $ % while that of compton-thick sources to15-20%. the fraction of compton-thick agn is lower than that predicted by thex-ray background synthesis model in the same luminosity and redshift range.}

0909.0224	the compton-thick agn in the cdf-n	we present x-ray spectral analysis of the brightest sources (f_{2-10kev}&gt;10^{-15}$ cgs) in the chandra deep field north. our sample consists of 222sources; for the vast majority (171) either a spectroscopic or a photometricredshift is available. our goal is to discover the compton-thick agn in adirect way i.e. through their x-ray spectra. compton-thick agn give away theirpresence in x-rays either directly through the absorption turnover redshiftedin the chandra passband, or through a flat, reflection-dominated, spectrum. theabove selection criteria yield 10 compton-thick agn candidates of which thenine are reflection dominated. the ir or sub-mm data where available,corroborate the presence of a heavily obscured nucleus in most cases. all thefive candidate compton-thick sources with available 24 micron data present veryhigh values of the f_{24}/f_r flux ratio suggesting that they are dust obscuredgalaxies. the low f_x/f_{ir} ratio also suggest the presence of obscured nucleiin many cases. four of the candidate compton-thick sources are associated withsub-mm galaxies at high redshifts z$\sim2$. the number count vs. fluxdistribution of the candidate compton-thick agn as well as their distributionwith redshift agree reasonably well with the predictions of the x-raybackground synthesis models of gilli et al.

0911.0102	comparison between the luminosity functions of x-ray and [oiii] selected  agn	we investigate claims according to which the x-ray selection of agn is not asefficient compared to that based on [oiii] selection because of the effects ofx-ray absorption.we construct the predicted x-ray luminosity function both forall seyferts as well as separately for seyfert-1 and seyfert-2 type galaxies,by combining the optical agn [oiii] luminosity functions derived in sdss withthe corresponding l_x-l_[oiii] relations. these relations are derived fromxmm-newton observations of all seyfert galaxies in the palomar spectroscopicsample of nearby galaxies after correction for x-ray absorption and opticalreddening. we compare the predicted x-ray luminosity functions with thoseactually observed in the local universe by heao-1, rxte as well as integral.the last luminosity function is derived in the 17-60 kev region and thus is notaffected by absorption even in the case of compton-thick sources. in the commonluminosity regions, the optically and x-ray selected seyfert galaxies showreasonable agreement. we thus find no evidence that the [oiii] selectionprovides a more robust tracer of powerful agn compared to the x-ray. still, theoptical selection probes less luminous seyferts compared to the current x-raysurveys. these low luminosity levels, are populated by a large number of x-rayunobscured seyfert-2 galaxies.

1006.0746	optically faint x-ray sources in the cdfn: spitzer constraints	we investigate the properties of the most optically faint sources in thegoods-n area (r &gt; 26.5 ab). such extremely optically faint populations presentan uncharted territory despite the fact that they represent an appreciablefraction of the x-ray sources in the goods-n field. they are believed tocontain either red agn at moderate redshifts or possibly qso at very highredshift. we compile our sample by first finding the 3.6um irac counterparts ofthe x-ray sources and searching for the optical counterparts of the iracsources. 35 sources do not have counterparts in the r-band subaru opticalimages. of these, 18 have hst-acs counterparts while the remaining have nooptical counterparts. the vast majority of our 35 sources are classified asextremely red objects (eros) on the basis of their v-k lower limits. theirphotometric redshifts show that these populate moderate redshifts (medianz~2.8), being markedly different from the already spectroscopically identifiedpopulation which peaks at z~0.7. the spitzer-irac mid-ir colours of the sourceswhich have no hst counterparts tend to lie within the mid-ir colour diagram agn"wedge", suggesting either qso, ulirg (mrk231), or early-type galaxy templatesat z&gt;3. a large fraction of our sources (17/35), regardless of whether theyhave hst counterparts, can be classified as mid-ir bright/optically faintsources (dust obscured galaxies) a class which is believed to include manyheavily absorbed agn. the co-added x-ray spectrum of the optically faintsources is very flat having a spectral index of gamma~0.87, significantlyflatter than the spectrum of the x-ray background. the optically faint r&gt;26.5x-ray sources constitute more than 50% of the total x-ray population atredshifts z&gt;2 bearing important implications for the luminosity function andits evolution; considering x-ray sources with 2&lt;z&lt;4 we find good agreement witha modified ple model.

1007.0350	x-ray selected infrared excess agn in the chandra deep fields: a  moderate fraction of compton-thick sources	we examine the properties of the x-ray detected, infrared excess agn or dustobscured galaxies (dogs) in the chandra deep fields (cdf). we find 26 x-rayselected sources which obey the 24 micron to r-band flux ratio criterionf_24/f_r&gt;1000. these are at a median redshift of 2.3 while their irluminosities are above 10^12 solar. their x-ray luminosities are all above afew times 10^42 erg s-1 in the 2-10 kev band unambiguously arguing that thesehost agn. nevertheless, their ir spectral energy distributions are splitbetween agn (mrk231) and star-forming templates (arp220). our primary goal isto examine their individual x-ray spectra in order to assess whether this x-raydetected dog population contains heavily obscured or even compton-thicksources. the x-ray spectroscopy reveals a mixed bag of objects. we find thatfour out of the 12 sources with adequate photon statistics and hence reliablex-ray spectra, show evidence for a hard x-ray spectral index (~1) orharder,consistent with a compton-thick spectrum. in total 12 out of the 26 dogsshow evidence for flat spectral indices. however, owing to the limited photonstatistics we cannot differentiate whether these are flat because they arereflection-dominated or because they show moderate amounts of absorption. sevendogs show relatively steep spectra (&gt;1.4) indicative of small column densities.all the above suggest a fraction of compton-thick sources that does not exceed5%. the average x-ray spectrum of all 26 dogs is hard (~1.1) or even harder(~0.6) when we exclude the brightest sources. these spectral indices are wellin agreement with the stacked spectrum of x-ray undetected sources (~0.8 in thecdfn). this could suggest (but not necessarily prove) that x-ray undetecteddogs, in a similar fashion to the x-ray detected ones presented here, arehosting a moderate fraction of compton-thick sources.

1009.0646	molecular lines as tracers of compton-thick agn ?	recently, papadopoulos et al., 2010 using sub-mm co molecular lineobservations of nearby ultra-luminous iras galaxies, (u)lirgs, have found thatexceptionally large gas column densities (n_h &gt; 10^25 cm-2) can be presentacross some of the very dense gaseous disks that are typically found in theseobjects. they also proposed a diagnostic for finding such sources using co andhcn molecular lines. given that such high column densities are expected toabsorb any x-ray luminous agn, yielding compton-thick sources, we set outtoexplore whether this can be discerned using x-ray observations. morespecifically we examine x-ray spectral observations of 14 sources in theirsample, using public chandra observations (0.5-10 kev) for eleven sources aswell as bepposax results (2-100 kev) from the literature for another threesources. our goal is to find candidate compton-thick agn and to check whetherthe molecular line selection criterion is successful in selecting such systems.x-ray spectroscopy reveals four candidate compton-thick agn of which half fallwithin the high obscuration region in the molecular line ratio diagnostics. ofthe remaining five sources falling into the `high dust obscuration' box, one(mrk273) is highly obscured (n_h ~4x10^23 cm-2) while in the other four thex-ray emission is most probably associated with star-forming processes ratherthan an agn on the basis of their x-ray and mid-infrared properties. overall,we argue that although this method as expected cannot recover all compton-thickagn, there are no examples of x-ray luminous agn inside that region that havelow obscuration, suggesting that this method is efficient in finding heavilyobscured agn in dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. the above results bearimportant implications for future joint alma and x-ray observations for thedetection of compton-thick agn.

1010.3530	x-ray observations of sub-mm laboca galaxies in the ecdfs	we explore the x-ray properties of the 126 sub-mm galaxies (smgs) of thelaboca survey in the cdfs and the ecdfs regions. smgs are believed toexperience massive episodes of star-formation. our goal is to examine whetherstar-formation coexists with agn activity, determine the fraction of highlyobscured agn and finally to obtain an idea of the dominant power-mechanism inthese sources. using spitzer and radio arc-second positions for the smgs, wefind 14 sources with significant x-ray detections. for most of these there areonly photometric redshifts available, with their median redshift being ~2.3.taking into account only the cdfs area which has the deepest x-rayobservations, we estimate an x-ray agn fraction of &lt;26+/-9 % among smgs. thex-ray spectral properties of the majority of the x-ray agn which are associatedwith smgs are consistent with high obscuration, 10^23 cm-2, but there is nounambiguous evidence for the presence of compton-thick sources. detailedspectral energy distribution fittings show that the bulk of total ir luminosityoriginates in star-forming processes, although a torus component is usuallypresent. finally, stacking analysis of the x-ray undetected smgs reveals asignal in the soft (0.5-2 kev) and marginally in the hard (2-5 kev) x-ray band.the hardness ratio of the stacked signal is relatively soft (-0.40+/-0.10)corresponding to a photon index of ~1.6. this argues against a high fraction ofcompton-thick sources among the x-ray undetected smgs.

1111.4084	the activity of the neighbours of seyfert galaxies	we present a follow-up study on a series of papers concerning the role ofclose interactions as a possible triggering mechanism of agn activity. we havealready studied the close (&lt;100kpc/h) and the large scale (&lt;1 mpc/h)environment of a local sample of sy1, sy2 and bright iras galaxies (birg) andtheir respective control samples. the results led us to the conclusion that aclose encounter appears capable of activating a sequence where an absorptionline galaxy (alg) galaxy becomes first a starburst, then a sy2 and finally asy1. here we investigate the activity of neighboring galaxies of differenttypes of agn, since both galaxies of an interacting pair should be affected. tothis end we present the optical spectroscopy and x-ray imaging of 30neighbouring galaxies around two local (z&lt;0.034) samples of 10 sy1 and 13 sy2galaxies. based on the optical spectroscopy we find that more than 70% of allneighbouring galaxies exhibit star forming and/or nuclear activity (namelyrecent star formation and/or agn), while an additional x-ray analysis showedthat this percentage might be significantly higher. furthermore, we find astatistically significant correlation, at a 99.9% level, between the value ofthe neighbour's [oiii]/h\beta ratio and the activity type of the central activegalaxy, i.e. the neighbours of sy2 galaxies are systematically more ionizedthan the neighbours of sy1s. this result, in combination with trends foundusing the equivalent width of the h\alpha emission line and the stellarpopulation synthesis code starlight, indicate differences in the stellar mass,metallicity and star formation history between the samples. our results pointtowards a link between close galaxy interactions and activity and also providemore clues regarding the possible evolutionary sequence inferred by ourprevious studies.

1204.4485	x-ray properties of radio-selected star forming galaxies in the  chandra-cosmos survey	x-ray surveys contain sizable numbers of star forming galaxies, beyond theagn which usually make the majority of detections. many methods to separate thetwo populations are used in the literature, based on x-ray and multiwavelengthproperties. we aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and tostudy the x-ray properties of the resulting samples. we build on a sample ofgalaxies selected at 1.4 ghz in the vla-cosmos survey, classified by smolcic etal. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with chandra. asimilarly selected control sample of agn is also used for comparison. we reviewsome x-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the samplecomposition. the efficiency of the classification scheme devised by smolcic etal. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expectedbecause of the higher x-ray brightness of agn with respect to galaxies. thelatter fraction is actually 50% in the x-ray detected sources, while it isexpected to be much lower among x-ray undetected sources. indeed, the analysisof the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, stronglydifferent properties between the agn and galaxy samples. x-ray based selectioncriteria are then used to refine both samples. the radio/x-ray luminositycorrelation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the samex-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. some evolution of the ratio may bepossible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likelyexplained by a bias arising from the radio selection. finally, we discuss thex-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the vla- and c-cosmos surveysaccording to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similardetermination from the chandra deep fields. the classification scheme proposedhere may find application in future works and surveys.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1306.2328	the hot and energetic universe: understanding the build-up of  supermassive black holes and galaxies at the heyday of the universe	observations in the last decade have provided strong evidence that the growthof supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies is among the mostinfluential processes in galaxy evolution. open questions that relate to ourcurrent understanding of black hole growth and its relation to the build-up ofgalaxies at redshifts z=1-4, when most black holes and stars we see inpresent-day galaxies were put in place, include: what is the nature of agnfeedback and whether it plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies?what is the dominant population of accreting agn at that critical epoch? is itdominated by obscured objects as required by many current observations andmodels? the athena+ mission concept will provide the technological leaprequired for a breakthrough in our understanding of agn and galaxy evolution atthe heyday of the universe. the high throughput of athena+ will allow thesystematic study of the incidence, nature and energetics of agn feedbackprocesses to z~4 via the identification and measurement of blue-shifted x-rayabsorption lines. the excellent survey and spectral capabilities of the athena+wide field imager will complete the census of black hole growth by yieldingsamples of up to 100 times larger than is currently possible of the mostheavily obscured, including compton thick, agn to redshifts z~4. thedemographics of this population relative to their hosts is fundamental forunderstanding how major black hole growth events relate to the build-up ofgalaxies.

1307.1471	the xmm-newton deep survey in the cdf-s vi. obscured agn selected as  infrared power-law galaxies	accretion onto smbh is believed to occur mostly in obscured agn. such objectsare proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those atx-ray energies. our main goal is to determine whether the revised irac criteriaof donley et al. (2012) (objects with an ir power-law spectral shape), areeffective at selecting x-ray type-2 agn. we present the results from the x-rayspectral analysis of 147 agn selected by cross-correlating the highest spectralquality ultra-deep xmm-newton and the spitzer/irac catalogues in the cdf-s.consequently it is biased towards sources with high s/n x-ray spectra. in orderto measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt asimple x-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsicabsorption and a possible soft x-ray component. we find 21/147 sources to beheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities donot allow us to confirm their compton-thick nature without resorting toadditional criteria. although ir power-law galaxies are less numerous in oursample than ir non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find thatthe fraction of absorbed (n_{h} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn is significantly higher(at about 3 sigma level) for ir-power-law sources ($\sim$2/3) than for thosesources that do not meet this ir selection criteria ($\sim$1/2). this behaviouris particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,although with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. we thereforeconclude that the ir power-law method is efficient in finding x-ray-absorbedsources. we would then expect that the long-sought dominant population ofabsorbed agn is abundant among ir power-law spectral shape sources not detectedin x-rays.

0801.4381	the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution with chandra	aims: we have compiled one of the largest normal-galaxy samples ever to probex-ray luminosity function evolution separately for early and late-type systems.  methods: we selected 207 normal galaxies up to redshift z~1.4, with data fromfour major chandra x-ray surveys, namely the chandra deep fields (north, southand extended) and xbootes, and a combination of x-ray and optical criteria. weused template spectral energy-distribution fitting to obtain separate early-and late-type sub-samples, made up of 101 and 106 systems, respectively. forthe full sample, as well as the two sub-samples, we obtained luminosityfunctions using both a non-parametric and a parametric, maximum-likelihoodmethod.  results: for the full sample, the non-parametric method strongly suggestsluminosity evolution with redshift. the maximum-likelihood estimate shows thatthis evolution follows ~(1+z)^k_total, k_total=2.2+-0.3. for the late-typesub-sample, we obtained k_late=2.4^+1.0_-2.0. we detected no significantevolution in the early-type sub-sample. the distributions of early andlate-type systems with redshift show that late types dominate at z&gt;~0.5 andhence drive the observed evolution for the total sample.  conclusions: our results support previous results in x-ray and otherwavebands, which suggests luminosity evolution with k=2-3.

0801.4386	the x-ray luminosity function of galaxies and its evolution	we compile one of the largest ever samples to probe the x-ray normal galaxyluminosity function and its evolution with cosmic time. in particular, weselect 207 galaxies (106 late and 101 early-type systems) from the chandra deepfield north and south surveys, the extended chandra deep field south and thexbootes survey. we derive the luminosity function separately for the total(early+late), the early and the late-type samples using both a parametricmaximum likelihood method, and a variant of the non-parametric 1/v_m method.although the statistics is limited, we find that the total (early+late) galaxysample is consistent with a pure luminosity evolution model where theluminosity evolves according to l(z) ~ (1+z)^2.2. the late-type systems appearto drive this trend while the early-type systems show much weaker evidence forevolution. we argue that the x-ray evolution of late-type systems is consistentwith that of blue galaxies in the optical. in contrast there is a mismatchbetween the x-ray evolution of early-type systems and that of red galaxies atoptical wavelengths.

1311.3700	a wide search for obscured active galactic nuclei using xmm-newton and  wise	we use a combination of the xmm-newton serendipitous x-ray survey with theoptical sdss, and the infrared wise all-sky survey in order to check theefficiency of the low x-ray to infrared luminosity selection method in findingheavily obscured agn. we select sources in the 2-8 kev x-ray band which have aredshift determination in the sdss catalogue. we match this sample with thewise catalogue, and fit the seds of the 2844 sources which have three, or more,photometric data-points in the infrared. we then select the heavily obscuredagn candidates by comparing their 12 micron agn luminosity to the observed 2-10kev x-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. with this approachwe find 20 candidates, and we examine their x-ray and optical spectra. of the20 initial candidates, we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which x-rayspectra could be fit) based on the x-ray spectra, and seven (78%; out of thenine detected spectroscopically in the sdss) based on the [oiii] line fluxes.combining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured agnto be 12-19, and the number of compton-thick agn to be 2-5, showing that themethod is reliable in finding obscured agn, but not compton-thick. howeverthose numbers are smaller than what would be expected from x-ray backgroundpopulation synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infraredselection and the scatter of the l_x-l_mir relation introduced by observationalconstraints limit the efficiency of the method. finally, we test popularobscured agn selection methods based on mid-infrared colours, and find that theprobability of an agn to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases withthe x-ray luminosity. however, a selection scheme based on a relatively lowx-ray luminosity and mid-infrared colours characteristic of qsos would notselect ~25% of the heavily obscured agn of our sample.

1402.4136	x-ray agn in the xmm-lss galaxy clusters: no evidence of agn suppression	we present a study of the overdensity of x-ray selected agn in 33 galaxyclusters in the xmm-lss field, up to redhift z=1.05. previous studies haveshown that the presence of x-ray selected agn in rich galaxy clusters issuppressed. in the current study we investigate the occurrence of x-rayselected agn in low and moderate x-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. due to thewide contiguous xmm-lss survey area we are able to extend the study to thecluster outskirts. we therefore determine the projected overdensity of x-raypoint-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. to provide robust statisticalresults we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities.we investigate whether the observed x-ray overdensities are to be expected byestimating also the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities. we find apositive x-ray projected overdensity at the first radial bin, which is howeverof the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. therefore, no suppression ofx-ray agn activity with respect to the field is found, implying that themechanisms responsible for the suppression are not so effective in lowerdensity environments. after a drop to roughly the background level between 2and 3r_{500}, the x-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,significantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. finally, usingredshift information of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatialoverdensity profile of the clusters. we find that the agreement between x-rayand optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested in the3-dimensional analysis. however, we argue that the x-ray overdensity "bump" atlarger radial distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitationallensing of background qsos. for high redshift clusters an enhancement of x-rayagn activity in their outskirts is still possible.

1407.6944	searching for highly obscured agn in the xmm-newton serendipitous source  catalog	the majority of active galactic nuclei (agn) are obscured by large amounts ofabsorbing material that makes them invisible at many wavelengths. x-rays, giventheir penetrating power, provide the most secure way for finding these agn. thexmm-newton serendipitous source catalog is the largest catalog of x-ray sourcesever produced; it contains about half a million detections. these sources aremostly agn. we have derived x-ray spectral fits for very many 3xmm-dr4 sources($\gtrsim$ 114 000 observations, corresponding to $\sim$ 77 000 uniquesources), which contain more than 50 source photons per detector. here, we usea subsample of $\simeq$ 1000 agn in the footprint of the sdss area (covering120 deg$^2$) with available spectroscopic redshifts. we searched for highlyobscured agn by applying an automated selection technique based on x-rayspectral analysis that is capable of efficiently selecting agn. the selectionis based on the presence of either a) flat rest-frame spectra; b) flat observedspectra; c) an absorption turnover, indicative of a high rest-frame columndensity; or d) an fe k$\alpha$ line with an equivalent width &gt; 500 ev. we found81 highly obscured candidate sources. subsequent detailed manual spectral fitsrevealed that 28 of them are heavily absorbed by column densities higher than10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. of these 28 agn, 15 are candidate compton-thick agn on thebasis of either a high column density, consistent within the 90% confidencelevel with n$_{\rm h}$ $&gt;$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, or a large equivalent width(&gt;500 ev) of the fe k$\alpha$ line. another six are associated withnear-compton-thick agn with column densities of $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. a combination of selection criteria a) and c) for low-qualityspectra, and a) and d) for medium- to high-quality spectra, pinpoint highlyabsorbed agn with an efficiency of 80%.

0804.4007	searching for mid-ir obscured agn in the cdf-n	the efficiency of mid-infrared selection methods for finding obscured agn isinvestigated using data in the \chandra deep field north. it is shown thatsamples of agn candidates compiled on the basis of mid-infrared colours onlysuffer substantial contamination from normal galaxies. x-ray stacking analysisreveals a soft mean x-ray spectrum for these sources, consistent withgamma~2.1. this suggests that star-forming galaxies and not obscured agndominate the stacked signal. in contrast agn selection methods that combinemid-infrared with optical criteria are more successful in finding heavilyobscured agn candidates. a method similar to the one proposed by fiore et al.(2008) is adopted to select extremely red objects (r-[3.6]&gt;3.7mag) with high24micron to optical flux ratio (f_24/f_r&gt;1000). about 80% of these sources arenot detected at x-ray wavelengths. stacking the x-ray photons at the positionsof these sources shows a flat mean x-ray spectrum (gamma~0.8), which suggestscompton-thick sources, low-luminosity and moderately obscured (n_h~8e22) agn,or a combination of the two. the mid-infrared colours and luminosities of thesesources are consistent with ulirgs at z~2, while hst/acs images, available forthe optically brighter of these sources, show disturbed optical morphologies inmany of them. the evidence above suggests that this population includes systemsin the process of formation.

1507.07558	the x-ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei in the redshift  interval z=3-5	we combine deep x-ray survey data from the chandra observatory and thewide-area/shallow xmm-xxl field to estimate the agn x-ray luminosity functionin the redshift range z=3-5. the sample consists of nearly 340 sources witheither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.the combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminositybaseline of three orders of magnitude, lx(2-10kev)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z&gt;3. wefollow a bayesian approach to determine the binned agn space density andexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. our methodology accountsfor poisson errors in the determination of x-ray fluxes and uncertainties inphotometric redshift estimates. we demonstrate that the latter is essential forunbiased measurement of space densities. we find that the agn x-ray luminosityfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. thereis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminositydependent. the space density of agn with lx&lt;1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter agnappears to be milder. comparison of our x-ray luminosity function with that ofuv/optical selected qsos at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at brightluminosities, lx&gt;1e45erg/s. the faint-end slope of uv/optical luminosityfunctions however, is steeper than for x-ray selected agn. this implies thatthe type-i agn fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z&gt;3, oppositeto trends established at lower redshift. we also assess the significance of agnin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. our x-ray luminosity functionyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep theuniverse ionised at redshift z&gt;4. a source of uncertainty in this calculationis the escape fraction of uv photons for x-ray selected agn.

astro-ph;0001179	a deep rosat survey xv. the average qso spectrum and its evolution	using a sample of 165 x-ray selected qsos from seven deep rosat fields weinvestigate the x-ray spectral properties of an ``average''radio-quiet broadline qso as a function of redshift. the qso stacked spectra, in the observers0.1-2 kev band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.2 apparentlyharden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seenin other qso samples. in contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 kev band show nosignificant variation in spectral index with redshift. this suggests thepresence of a spectral upturn at low energies (&lt;0.5 kev). indeed, while at highredshifts (z&gt;1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to thedata over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a secondcomponent at low energies, a `soft excess'. inclusion of a simple model for thesoft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kt~100 ev), results in a significantimprovement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for allredshift bins. this power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, withthose of nearby agn in the 2-10 kev band, suggesting that the same intrinsicpower-law slope may continue from 10 kev down to below 0.5 kev. we caution thatthere is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent areal physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a largedispersion in spectral indices. regardless of the origin of the soft excess,the average qso spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the x-raybackground: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift qso aresignificantly steeper than the spectrum of the x-ray background extending thespectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 kev x-ray band.

astro-ph;0105125	asca observations of deep rosat fields v. the x-ray spectrum of hard  x-ray selected qsos	we present an analysis of the \rosat and \asca spectra of 21 broad line agn(qsos) with $z\sim 1$ detected in the 2-10 kev band with the \asca \gis. thesummed spectrum in the \asca band is well described by a power-law with$\gamma=1.56\pm0.18$, flatter that the average spectral index of bright qsosand consistent with the spectrum of the x-ray background in this band. the flatspectrum in the \asca band could be explained by only a moderate absorption($\sim 10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$) assuming the typical agn spectrum ie a power-lawwith $\gamma$=1.9. this could in principle suggest that some of the highlyobscured agn, required by most x-ray background synthesis models, may beassociated with normal blue qsos rather than narrow-line agn.  however, the combined 0.5-8 kev \asca-\rosat spectrum is well fit by apower-law of $\gamma=1.7\pm0.2$ with a spectral upturn at soft energies.  it has been pointed out that such an upturn may be an artefact ofuncertainties in the calibration of the rosat or asca detectors. neverthelessif real, it could imply that the above absorption model suggested by the \ascadata alone is ruled out. then a large fraction of qsos could have ``concave''spectra ie they gradually steepen towards softer energies. this result is inagreement with the \bepposax hardness ratio analysis of $\sim$ 100 hard x-rayselected sources.

astro-ph;0503494	the xmm-newton needles in the haystack survey: the local x-ray  luminosity function of 'normal' galaxies	in this paper we estimate the local (z&lt;0.22) x-ray luminosity function of`normal' galaxies derived from the xmm-newton needles in the haystack survey.this is an on-going project that aims to identify x-ray selected `normal'galaxies (i.e. non-agn dominated) in the local universe. we are using a totalof 70 xmm-newton fields covering an area of 11 sq. degrees which overlap withthe sloan digital sky survey data release-2. `normal' galaxies are selected onthe basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low x-ray--to--opticalflux ratio (log(f_x/f_o)&lt;-2) and soft x-ray colours. we find a total of 28candidate `normal' galaxies to the 0.5-8 kev band flux limit of ~2x10^{-15}cgs. optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 percent). these provide additional evidence that our sources are bona-fide'normal' galaxies with x-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emissionand/or x-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. sixteen of ourgalaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type spectral energy distribution(sed) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-typesed. combining our xmm-newton sample with 18 local (z&lt;0.22) galaxies from thechandra deep field north and south surveys, we construct the local x-rayluminosity function of `normal' galaxies. this can be represented with aschechter form with a break at l* ~ 3x10^{41} cgs and a slope of ~1.78+/-0.12.using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of theform  (1+z)^{3.3} we estimate a contribution to the x-ray background from `normal'galaxies of 10-20 per cent (0.5-8 kev). finally, we derive, for the first time,the luminosity functions for early and late type systems separately.

astro-ph;0702132	x-ray selected starbursts in the goods-north	we investigate claims that recent deep x-ray surveys are detecting starburstsat cosmologically interesting redshifts (z=0-1). we combine x-ray data from the2ms cdf-north with multi-wavelength observations from goods to build the seds(uv, optical, ir) of x-ray sources in this field. these are fit with modeltemplates providing an estimate of the total ir luminosity of each source. wethen exploit the correlation between ir and x-ray luminosities for star-forminggalaxies, established in the local universe, to select sources that aredominated by star-formation. this approach is efficient in discriminatingnormal galaxies from agn over a wide range of sfrs. the resulting sampleconsists of 45 x-ray selected star-forming systems at a median redshift z~0.5,the majority of which (60%) are lirgs or ulirgs. this sample is least affectedby incompleteness and agn contamination and is well suited for cosmologicalstudies. we quantify the x-ray evolution of these sources by constructing theirdifferential, dn/ds, and comparing them with evolving luminosity functionmodels. the results are consistent with luminosity evolution of the form(1+z)^{p} with p~2.4. this is similar to the evolution rate of star-forminggalaxies selected at other wavelengths, suggesting that the deep x-ray surveys,are indeed finding the starburst galaxy population that drives the rapidevolution of the global sfr density in the range z~0-1. our analysis alsoreveals a separate population of ir-faint x-ray sources. these include oldgalaxies but also systems that are x-ray luminous for their stellar masscompared to local e/s0. we argue that these may be post-starbursts that will,over time, become fainter at x-rays and will eventually evolve into early-typesystems (e.g. e/s0).

astro-ph;0702424	radio observations of the cdf-south: a possible link between radio  emission and star formation in x-ray selected agn	we explore the nature of the radio emission of x-ray selected agn bycombining deep radio (1.4ghz; 60micro-jy) and x-ray data with multiwavelength(optical, mid-infrared) observations in the extended chandra deep field south(e-cdfs). the fraction of radio detected x-ray sources increases from 9% in thee-cdfs to 14% in the central region of this field, which has deeper x-raycoverage from the 1ms cdfs. we find evidence that the radio emission of up to60% of the hard x-ray/radio matched agn is likely associated withstar-formation in the host galaxy. firstly, the mid-ir (24micron) properties ofthese sources are consistent with the infrared/radio correlation of starbursts.secondly, most of them are found in galaxies with blue rest-frame opticalcolours (u-v), suggesting a young stellar population. on the contrary,x-ray/radio matched agn which are not detected in the mid-infrared have red u-vcolours suggesting their radio emission is associated with agn activity. wealso find no evidence for a population of heavily obscured radio-selected agnthat are not detected in x-rays. finally, we do no confirm previous claims fora correlation between radio emission and x-ray obscuration. assuming that theradio continuum measures star-formation, this finding is against models wherethe dust and gas clouds associated with circumnuclear starbursts arespherically blocking our view to the central engine.

astro-ph;0703493	searching for hidden agn in nearby star-forming galaxies with chandra	(abridged) aims: we searched for x-ray signatures of agn in a sample ofstar-forming, relatively early-type, nearby spiral galaxies. such galaxies arelikely to host nuclear super-massive black holes. methods: for 9 sources fromthe ho et al. optical sample, we isolated 10 individual chandra x-ray sourcesclosest to the optical position and calculated x-ray luminosities, lx, x-raycolours, and, using halpha luminosities, star formation rates. for 4 sourceswith sufficient counts, we extracted x-ray spectra and fitted standard spectralmodels. we assessed the significance of adding an fe k alpha emission gaussiancomponent to a fit by means of a calibration of the standard f-test. for therest of the sources, we estimated values for the intrinsic hydrogen columndensity, nhint, and the power-law photon index, gamma, which can reproduce theobserved x-ray colours. results: for the nuclear sources in ngc 2782 and ngc3310, a fe k alpha emission-line component is included with high significance,whilst the power-law is flat (gamma~0 and 1.3). both sources have highstar-formation rates, with the rate for ngc 2782 being the highest in oursample. conclusions: our detection of fe k alpha emission coming from acentral, isolated source points towards a hidden agn in 2 out of 9 relativelyearly-type, star-forming spirals. the presence of an agn is thus likely inmassive, disturbed starbursts, although the x-ray contribution is small: forthe central source, the bolometric luminosity is a fraction of a few x 10^-5 ofthe eddington luminosity. the x-ray flux of the central source is between 10and 20% of the total galactic flux in the 0.2-10 kev band.

astro-ph;9804247	the broad-band x-ray spectrum of mrk 3	we have used non-simultaneous ginga, asca and rosat observations toinvestigate the complex x-ray spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3. we findthat the composite spectrum can be well described in terms of a heavily cut-offhard x-ray continuum, iron k_alpha emission and a soft x-ray excess, withspectral variability confined to changes in the continuum normalisation and theflux in the iron line. previous studies have suggested that the power-lawcontinuum in mrk 3 is unusually hard. we obtain a canonical value for theenergy index of the continuum (i.e. alpha approx 0.7) when a warm absorber(responsible for an absorption edge observed near 8 kev) is included in thespectral model. alternatively, the inclusion of a reflection component yields acomparable power-law index. the soft-excess flux cannot be modelled solely interms of pure electron scattering of the underlying power-law continuum.however, a better fit to the spectral data is obtained if we include theeffects of both emission and absorption in a partially photoionized scatteringmedium. in particular the spectral feature prominent at $\sim 0.9$ kev couldrepresent o viii recombination radiation produced in a hot photoionized medium.we discuss our results in the context of other recent studies of the soft x-rayspectra of seyfert 2 galaxies.

astro-ph;9810413	asca observations of deep rosat fields iv.ir and hard x-ray observations  of an obscured high-redshift qso	we use ukirt and asca observations to determine the nature of a high redshift(z=2.35) narrow-line agn, previously discovered by almaini et al. (1995). theukirt observations show a broad halpha line while no hbeta line is detected.this together with the red colour (b-k=5.4) suggest that our object is amoderately obscured qso (av&gt;3), in optical wavelengths. the asca data suggest ahard spectrum, probably due to a large obscuring column, with a photon index of1.93 (+0.62, -0.46), nh~10^23. the combined asca and rosat data again suggest aheavily obscured spectrum (nh~10^23 or av~100). in this picture, the rosat softx-ray emission may arise from electron scattering, in a similar fashion tolocal seyfert 1.9. then, there is a large discrepancy between the moderatereddening witnessed by the ir and the large x-ray absorbing column. this couldbe possibly explained on the basis of e.g. high gas metallicities or assumingthat the x-ray absorbing column is inside the dust sublimation radius. analternative explanation can be obtained when we allow for variability betweenthe rosat and asca observations. then the best fit spectrum is still flat, 1.35(+0.16, -0.14), but with low intrinsic absorption in better agreement with their data, while the rosat normalization is a factor of two below the ascanormalization. this object may be one of the bright examples of a type-ii qsopopulation at high redshift, previously undetected in optical surveys. the hardx-ray spectrum of this object suggests that such a population could make asubstantial contribution to the x-ray background.

astro-ph;9912348	x-ray observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy iras19254-7245  (the superantennae)	we present rosat hri and asca observations of the well known ulirgiras19254-7245 (the superantennae). the object is not detected by rosatyielding a 3\sigma upper limit of l_x ~8x10^{41} erg/s in the 0.1-2 kev band.however, we obtain a clear detection by asca yielding a luminosity in the 2-10kev band of 2 \times 10^{42}erg/s. its x-ray spectrum is very hard, equivalentto a photon index of gamma=1.0+-0.35.  we therefore, attempt to model the x-ray data with a "scatterer" model inwhich the intrinsic x-ray emission along our line of sight is obscured by anabsorbing screen while some fraction, f, is scattered into our line of sight byan ionized medium; this is the standard model for the x-ray emission inobscured (but non compton-thick)  seyfert galaxies. we obtain an absorbing column of 2x10^{23}cm^{-2} for apower-law photon index of gamma=1.9, an order of magnitude above the columnestimated on the basis of optical observations; the percentage of the scatteredemission is high (~20%). alternatively, a model where most of the x-rayemission comes from reflection on a compton thick torus (n_h&gt;10^{24} cm^{-2})cannot be ruled out.  we do not detect an fe line at 6.4 kev; however, the upper limit (90%) to theequivalent width of the 6.4 kev line is high (~3 kev).  all the above suggest that most of the x-ray emission originates in an highlyobscured seyfert-2 nucleus.
