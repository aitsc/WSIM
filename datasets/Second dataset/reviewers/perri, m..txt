0901.0257	evidence for an anticorrelation between the duration of the shallow  decay phase of grb x-ray afterglows and redshift	one of the most intriguing features discovered by swift is a plateau phase inthe x-ray flux decay of about 70% of the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs).the physical origin of this feature is still being debated. we constrain theproposed interpretations, based on the intrinsic temporal properties of theplateau phase. we selected and analyzed all the swift/xrt grb afterglows atknown redshift observed between march 2005 and june 2008 featuring a shallowdecay phase in their x-ray lightcurves. for our sample of 21 grbs we find ananticorrelation of the logarithm of the duration of the shallow phase with redshift, with a spearman rank-order correlation coefficient of r=-0.4 and a nullhypothesis probability of 5%. when we correct the durations for cosmologicaldilation, the anticorrelation strenghtens, with r=-0.6 and a null hypothesisprobability of 0.4%. considering only those grbs in our sample that have awell-measured burst peak energy (8 out of 21), we find an anticorrelationbetween the energy of the burst and the shallow phase duration, with r=-0.80and a null hypothesis probability of 1.8%. if the burst energy anticorrelationwith the shallow phase duration is real, then the dependence of the shallowphase on redshift could be the result of a selection effect, since on averagehigh-redshift bursts with lower energies and longer plateaus would be missed. aburst energy anticorrelation with the shallow phase duration would be expectedif the end of the plateau arises from a collimated outflow. alternativescenarios are briefly discussed involving a possible cosmological evolution ofthe mechanism responsible for the x-ray shallow decay.

0901.1284	swift observations of ibl and lbl objects	bl lacs are an enigmatic class of active galactic nuclei (agns),characterized by the non-thermal continuum typically attributed to synchrotronand inverse compton emission. depending on the frequency location of the maximaof these components, they are subdivided into three subclasses lbls, ibls, andhbls. we present the results of a set of observations of eight bl lac objectsof lbl and ibl type performed by the xrt and uvot detectors onboard the swiftsatellite between january 2005 and november 2006. we are mainly interested inmeasuring the spectral parameters, and particularly the steepness between theuv and the x-ray band, useful for determining the classification of thesesources. we compare the behavior of these sources with previous xmm-newton,bepposax obser- vations and with historical data in the x-ray and in theoptical band. we are also interested in classifying the sources in our sampleon the basis of the observations and comparing them with their classificationpresented in literature. we performed x-ray spectral analysis of observed bllac objects using a simple powerlaw and in a few cases the log-parabolic model.we also combined the uv emission with the low energy x-ray data to we usedobservational data to classify sources in our sample and derived parameters oftheir spectral energy distribution. we found that for the ibls x-rays lowstates show features of the high energy component, usually interpreted as dueto inverse compton emission. sources in our sample exhibit a range of temporaluv and x-ray behaviors, some objects having clear and neat correlated uv andx-ray variations (e.g. on231) and other objects showing no clear (e.g. ao0235+164) uv and x-ray correlation. finally, we also note that our estimates ofspectral curvature are in the range of that measured for the hbls.

0901.4124	swift observations of the very intense flaring activity of mrk 421  during 2006: i. phenomenological picture of electron acceleration and  predictions for the mev/gev emission	we present results from a deep spectral analysis of all the swiftobservations of mrk 421 from april 2006 to july 2006, when it reached itslargest x-ray flux recorded until 2006. the peak flux was about 85 milli-crabin the 2.0-10.0 kev band, with the peak energy (ep) of the spectral energydistribution (sed) laying often at energies larger than 10 kev. we performedspectral analysis of the swift observations investigating the trends of thespectral parameters in terms of acceleration and energetic featuresphenomenologically linked to the ssc model parameters, predicting their effectsin the gamma-ray band, in particular the spectral shape expected in the fermigamma-ray space telescope-lat band. we confirm that the x-ray spectrum is welldescribed by a log-parabolic distribution close to ep, with the peak flux ofthe sed (sp) being correlated with ep, and ep anti-correlated with thecurvature parameter (b). during the most energetic flares the uv-to-soft-x-rayspectral shape requires an electron distribution spectral index s about 2.3.present analysis shows that the uv-to-x-ray emission from mrk 421 is likely tobe originated by a population of electrons that is actually curved, with a lowenergy power-law tail. the observed spectral curvature is consistent both withstochastic acceleration or energy dependent acceleration probabilitymechanisms, whereas the power-law slope form xrt-uvot data is very close tothat inferred from the grbs x-ray afterglow and in agreement with the universalfirst-order relativistic shock acceleration models. this scenario hints thatthe magnetic turbulence may play a twofold role: spatial diffusion relevant tothe first order process and momentum diffusion relevant to the second orderprocess.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

0704.3682	igr j16194-2810: a new symbiotic x-ray binary	we here report on the multiwavelength study which led us to theidentification of x-ray source igr j16194-2810 as a new symbiotic x-ray binary(syxb), that is, a rare type of low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) composed of am-type giant and a compact object. using the accurate x-ray position allowed byswift/xrt data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a m2 iii star. besides,the combined use of the spectral information afforded by xrt and integral/ibisshows that the 0.5-200 kev spectrum of this source can be described with anabsorbed comptonization model, usually found in lmxbs and, in particular, insyxbs. no long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the ibisdata. the time coverage afforded by xrt reveals shot-noise variability typicalof accreting galactic x-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore thepresence of x-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. byusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source suchas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and x-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the0.5-200 kev band), and we give a description for this system (typical of syxbs)in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind ofits m-type giant companion. we also draw some comparisons between igrj16194-2810 and other sources belonging to this subclass, finding that thisobject resembles syxbs 4u 1700+24 and 4u 1954+31.

0711.3753	swift captures the spectrally evolving prompt emission of grb 070616	the origins of gamma-ray burst prompt emission are currently not wellunderstood and in this context long, well-observed events are particularlyimportant to study. we present the case of grb 070616, analysing theexceptionally long-duration multipeaked prompt emission, and later afterglow,captured by all the instruments on-board swift and by suzaku wam. the highenergy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds beforegoing into a steep decline. spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearlytaking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after thetrigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peakenergy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. thesteep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectralevolution and the curvature effect. we investigate origins for the spectralevolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering insteadan additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. we alsodiscuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of theafterglow. the case of grb 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadbandcoverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of thecomplex prompt emission in grbs.

1210.4652	timing accuracy of the swift x-ray telescope in wt mode	the x-ray telescope (xrt) on board swift was mainly designed to providedetailed position, timing and spectroscopic information on gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglows. during the mission lifetime the fraction of observing timeallocated to other types of source has been steadily increased. in this paper,we report on the results of the in-flight calibration of the timingcapabilities of the xrt in windowed timing read-out mode. we use observationsof the crab pulsar to evaluate the accuracy of the pulse period determinationby comparing the values obtained by the xrt timing analysis with the valuesderived from radio monitoring. we also check the absolute time reconstructionmeasuring the phase position of the main peak in the crab profile and comparingit both with the value reported in literature and with the result that weobtain from a simultaneous rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) observation. wefind that the accuracy in period determination for the crab pulsar is of theorder of a few picoseconds for the observation with the largest data time span.the absolute time reconstruction, measured using the position of the crab mainpeak, shows that the main peak anticipates the phase of the position reportedin literature for rxte by ~270 microseconds on average (~150 microseconds whendata are reduced with the attitude file corrected with the uvot data). theanalysis of the simultaneous swift-xrt and rxte proportional counter array(pca) observations confirms that the xrt crab profile leads the pca profile by~200 microseconds. the analysis of xrt photodiode mode data and bat event datashows a main peak position in good agreement with the rxte, suggesting thediscrepancy observed in xrt data in windowed timing mode is likely due to asystematic offset in the time assignment for this xrt read out mode.

0712.2116	x-ray spectral evolution of tev bl lac objects: eleven years of  observations with bepposax, xmm-newton and swift satellites	many of the extragalactic sources detected in $\gamma$ rays at tev energiesare bl lac objects. in particular, they belong to the subclass of ``highfrequency peaked bl lacs" (hbls), as their spectral energy distributionsexhibit a first peak in the x-ray band. at a closer look, their x-ray spectraappear to be generally curved into a log-parabolic shape. in a previousinvestigation of mrk 421, two correlations were found between the spectralparameters. one involves the height $s_p$ increasing with the position $e_p$ ofthe first peak; this was interpreted as a signature of synchrotron emissionfrom relativistic electrons. the other involves the curvature parameter $b$decreasing as $e_p$ increases; this points toward statistical/stochasticacceleration processes for the emitting electrons. we analyse x-ray spectra ofseveral tev hbls to pinpoint their behaviours in the $e_p-s_p$ and $e_p-b$planes and to compare them with mrk 421. we perfom x-ray spectral analyses of asample of 15 bl lacs. we report the whole set of observations obtained with the\sax, \xmm and \swf satellites between 29/06/96 and 07/04/07. we focus on fivesources (pks 0548-322, 1h 1426+418, mrk 501, 1es 1959+650, pks2155-304) whosex-ray observations warrant detailed searching of correlations or trends. withinour database, we find that four out of five sources, namely pks 0548-322, 1h1426+418, mrk 501 and 1es 1959+650, follow similar trends as mrk 421 in the$e_p-s_p$ plane, while pks 2155-304 differs. as for the $e_p-b$ plane, all tevhbls follow a similar behaviour. the trends exhibited by mrk 421 appear to beshared by several tev hbls, such as to warrant discussing predictions from thex-ray spectral evolution to that of tev emissions.

1307.1733	the nustar extragalactic survey: a first sensitive look at the  high-energy cosmic x-ray background population	we report on the first ten identifications of sources serendipitouslydetected by the nustar to provide the first sensitive census of the cosmicx-ray background (cxb) source population at &gt;10 kev. we find that thesenustar-detected sources are ~100x fainter than those previously detected at &gt;10kev and have a broad range in redshift and luminosity (z=0.020-2.923 andl_10-40 kev~4x10^{41}-5x10^{45} erg/s); the median redshift and luminosity arez~0.7 and l_10-40 kev~3x10^{44} erg/s, respectively. we characterize thesesources on the basis of broad-band ~0.5-32 kev spectroscopy, opticalspectroscopy, and broad-band ultraviolet-to-mid-infrared sed analyzes. we findthat the dominant source population is quasars with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s,of which ~50% are obscured with n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2}. however, none of the tennustar sources are compton thick (n_h&gt;10^{24} cm^{-2}) and we place a 90%confidence upper limit on the fraction of compton-thick quasars (l_10-40kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s) selected at &gt;10 kev of ~33% over the redshift rangez=0.5-1.1. we jointly fitted the rest-frame ~10-40 kev data for all of thenon-beamed sources with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{43} erg/s to constrain the averagestrength of reflection; we find r&lt;1.4 for \gamma=1.8, broadly consistent withthat found for local agns observed at &gt;10 kev. we also constrain the hostgalaxy masses and find a median stellar mass of ~10^{11} m_sun, a factor ~5times higher than the median stellar mass of nearby high-energy selected agns,which may be at least partially driven by the order of magnitude higher x-rayluminosities of the nustar sources. within the low source-statistic limitationsof our study, our results suggest that the overall properties of the nustarsources are broadly similar to those of nearby high-energy selected agns butscaled up in luminosity and mass.

1309.4494	first results from nustar observations of mkn 421	mkn 421 is a nearby active galactic nucleus dominated at all wavelengths by avery broad non-thermal continuum thought to arise from a relativistic jet seenat a small angle to the line of sight. its spectral energy distribution peaksin the x-ray and tev gamma-ray bands, where the energy output is dominated bycooling of high-energy electrons in the jet. in order to study the electrondistribution and its evolution, we carried out a dedicated multi-wavelengthcampaign, including extensive observations by the recently launched highlysensitive hard x-ray telescope nustar, between december 2012 and may 2013. herewe present some initial results based on nustar data from january through march2013, as well as calibration observations conducted in 2012. although theobservations cover some of the faintest hard x-ray flux states ever observedfor mkn 421, the sensitivity is high enough to resolve intra-day spectralvariability. we find that in this low state the dominant flux variations aresmooth on timescales of hours, with typical intra-hour variations of less than5%. we do not find evidence for either a cutoff in the hard x-ray spectrum, ora rise towards a high-energy component, but rather that at low flux thespectrum assumes a power law shape with a photon index of approximately 3. thespectrum is found to harden with increasing brightness.

1403.4978	asymmetries in core-collapse supernovae from maps of radioactive  $^{44}$ti in cassiopeiaa	asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapseexplosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. thespatial distribution of radioactive 44ti, synthesized in an exploding star nearthe boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and thatejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries.cassiopeiaa is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44ti emissionhas previously been detected but not imaged. asymmetries in the explosion havebeen indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44ti emission toestimated 56ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like featuresseen in the x-ray and optical ejecta. here we report spatial maps and spectralproperties of the 44ti in cassiopeia a. this may explain the unexpected lack ofcorrelation between the 44ti and iron x-ray emission, the latter being visibleonly in shock-heated material. the observed spatial distribution rules outsymmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well ashighly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor.instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development oflow-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1502.04699	rapid variability of blazar 3c 279 during flaring states in 2013-2014  with joint fermi-lat, nustar, swift, and ground-based multi-wavelength  observations	we report the results of a multi-band observing campaign on the famous blazar3c 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 december to2014 april, including first observations of it with nustar. the $\gamma$-rayemission of the source measured by fermi-lat showed multiple distinct flaresreaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning ofthe fermi mission, with $f(e &gt; 100\,{\rm mev})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. the$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of$\gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radioquasars. the lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high comptondominance parameter $l_\gamma/l_{\rm syn} &gt; 300$. two 1-day nustar observationswith accompanying swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing differentlevels of source activity. while the 0.5$-$70 kev x-ray spectrum obtainedduring the first pointing, and fitted jointly with swift-xrt is well-describedby a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectralstructure: the spectrum softens by $\delta\gamma_{\rm x} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4kev. modeling the broad-band sed during this flare with the standardsynchrotron plus inverse compton model requires: (1) the location of the$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jetpower significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $l_{\rm j}/l_{\rmd} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $l_{\rm b}/l_{\rmj} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. we also find that single-zone models that match theobserved $\gamma$-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain theproduction of x-ray emission.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

0806.1855	agile and swift simultaneous observations of the blazar s50716+714  during the bright flare of october 2007	we present the results of a series of optical, uv, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out by the swift and agilesatellites in late 2007 when this blazar was flaring close to its historicalmaximum at optical frequencies. we have found that the optical through softx-ray emission, likely due to synchrotron radiation, was highly variable anddisplayed a different behavior in the optical uv and soft x-ray bands. the 4-10kev flux, most probably dominated by the inverse compton component, remainedinstead constant. the counting statistics in the relatively short agile gridobservation was low and consistent with a constant gamma-ray flux at a levelsimilar to the maximum observed by egret. an estimate of the gamma-ray spectralslope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2 suggesting that thepeak of the inverse compton component in the spectral energy distribution (sed)is within the agile energy band. the different variability behavior observed indifferent parts of the sed exclude interpretations predicting highly correlatedflux variability like changes of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field insimple ssc scenarios. the observed sed changes may instead be interpreted asdue to the sum of two ssc components, one of which is constant while the otheris variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0806.4824	first high energy observations of narrow line seyfert 1s with  integral/ibis	narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1) are very interesting objects whichdisplay peculiar properties when compared to their broad line analogues (bls1).although well studied in many wavebands, their behaviour at &gt;10 kev is poorlystudied and yet important to discriminate between models invoked to explain thecomplexity observed in the x-ray band. here we present for the first time highenergy observations (17-100 kev) of five nls1 galaxies (3 bona fide and 2candidates) detected by integral/ibis and provide for all of them a broad bandspectral analysis using data obtained by swift/xrt below 10 kev. the combinedintegral spectrum is found to be steeper (gamma=2.6 +/- 0.3) than those ofclassical seyfert 1 objects. this is due to a high energy cutoff, which isrequired in some individual fits as in the average broad band spectrum. thelocation of this high energy cutoff is at lower energies (e &lt; 60 kev) thantypically seen in classical type 1 agns; a reflection component may also bepresent but its value (r &lt; 0.8) is compatible with those seen in standardseyfert 1s. we do not detect a soft excess in individual objects but only intheir cumulative spectrum. our results suggest a lower plasma temperature forthe accreting plasma which combined to the high accretion rates (close to theeddington rate) point to different nuclear conditions in broad and narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxies, likely related to different evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0301227	what types of jets does nature make: a new population of radio quasars	we use statistical results from a large sample of about 500 blazars, based ontwo surveys, the deep x-ray radio blazar survey (dxrbs), nearly complete, andthe rass-green bank survey (rgb), to provide new constraints on the spectralenergy distribution of blazars, particularly flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq). this reassessment is prompted by the discovery of a population of fsrqwith spectral energy distribution similar to that of high-energy peaked bllacs. the fraction of these sources is sample dependent, being ~ 10% in dxrbsand ~ 30% in rgb (and reaching ~ 80% for the einstein medium sensitivitysurvey). we show that these ``x-ray strong'' radio quasars, which had goneundetected or unnoticed in previous surveys, indeed are the strong-linedcounterparts of high-energy peaked bl lacs and have synchrotron peakfrequencies, nu_peak, much higher than ``classical'' fsrq, typically in the uvband for dxrbs. some of these objects may be 100 gev - tev emitters, as areseveral known bl lacs with similar broadband spectra. our large, deep, andhomogeneous dxrbs sample does not show anti-correlations between nu_peak andradio, broad line region, or jet power, as expected in the so-called ``blazarsequence'' scenario. however, the fact that fsrq do not reach x-ray-to-radioflux ratios and nu_peak values as extreme as bl lacs and the elusiveness ofhigh nu_peak - high-power blazars suggest that there might be an intrinsic,physical limit to the synchrotron peak frequency that can be reached bystrong-lined, powerful blazars. our findings have important implications forthe study of jet formation and physics and its relationship to other propertiesof active galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0508034	non-thermal cosmic backgrounds from blazars: the contribution to the  cmb, x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds	we present a new assessment of the contribution of blazars to theextragalactic background radiation across the e.m. spectrum. our calculationsrely on deep blazar radio counts that we derived combining severalmultifrequency surveys. the integrated blazar emission yields a broad-bandnon-thermal background that in some parts of the e.m. spectrum dominates theextragalactic brightness. blazars are the main point-like contributors to thecmb. their integrated emission causes an apparent t increase of 5-50 muk in the50-250 ghz range. the cmb fluctuation spectrum is sensibly contaminated atl&gt;300, for a poissonian source distribution, or at lower l values if spatialclustering is present. we estimate that well over 100,000 blazars will producea significant signal in the planck cmb anisotropy maps. because of themicrowave-xray flux correlation, these sources are expected to have flux &gt; afew 10^{-15} erg/s in the soft x-ray band. thus, a large fraction of theforeground sources in cmb anisotropy maps could be identified and removed usinga multi frequency approach, provided that a sufficiently deep all sky x-raysurvey will be available. we further show that blazars are a major constituentof all high-e extragalactic backgrounds. their contribution is 11-12% at x-rayfrequencies and possibly 100% in the 0.5-50 mev band. at e&gt;100 mev, the blazarcollective emission, obtained extrapolating their integrated micro-wave flux tothe gamma-ray band using the sed of egret detected sources, over-predicts theextragalactic background by a large factor, implying that blazars not onlydominate the gamma-ray sky but also that their average duty cycle at thesefrequencies must be rather low. we also find that blazars of the hbl type mayproduce a significant amount of flux at tev energies.

astro-ph;0511673	log-parabolic spectra and particle acceleration in blazars. iii: ssc  emission in the tev band from mkn 501	curved broad-band spectral distributions of non-thermal sources like blazarsare described well by a log-parabolic (lp) law where the second degree termmeasures the curvature. lp energy spectra can be obtained for relativisticelectrons by means of a statistical acceleration mechanism whose probability ofacceleration depends on energy. in this paper we compute the spectra radiatedby an electron population via synchrotron (s) and synchro-self compton(ssc)processes to derive the relations between the lp parameters. these spectra wereobtained by means of an accurate numerical code. we found that the ratiobetween the curvature parameters of the s spectrum to that of the electrons isequal to about 0.2 instead of 0.25, the value foreseen in the deltaapproximation. inverse compton spectra are also intrinsically curved and can beapproximated by a log-parabola only in limited ranges. the curvature parameter,estimated around the sed peak, may vary from a lower value than that of the sspectrum up to that of emitting electrons depending on whether the scatteringis in the thomson or in the klein-nishina regime. we applied this analysis tocomputing the ssc emission from the bl lac object mkn 501 during the largeflare of april 1997. we fit simultaneous bepposax and cat data and reproducedintensities and spectral curvatures of both components with good accuracy. thelarge curvature observed in the tev range was found to be mainly intrinsic, andtherefore did not require a large pair production absorption against theextragalactic background. we regard this finding as an indication that theuniverse is more transparent at these energies than previously assumed byseveral models found in the literature. this conclusion is supported by recentdetection of two relatively high redshift blazars with h.e.s.s.

astro-ph;0512392	swift and xmm observations of the dark grb 050326	we present swift and xmm observations of grb 050326, detected by swift-bat.the fluence was 7.7x10^-6 erg cm^-2 (20-150 kev), and its spectrum was hard,with a power law photon index 1.25. the afterglow light curve did not show anybreak nor flares between ~1 hr and ~6 d after the burst, and decayed with aslope 1.70. the afterglow spectrum is well fitted by a power-law model,suffering absorption both in the milky way and in the host galaxy. therest-frame hydrogen column density is significant, n_h_z &gt; 4x10^21 cm^-2, andthe redshift of the absorber is z &gt; 1.5. there was good agreement between theswift-xrt and xmm results. by comparing the prompt and afterglow fluxes, wefound that an early break occurred before the xrt observation. the propertiesof the grb 050326 afterglow are well described by a spherical fireballexpanding in a uniform external medium, so a further steepening is expected atlater times. the lack of such a break constrains the jet angle to be &gt;7 deg.using the redshift constraints provided by the x-ray analysis, we alsoestimated that the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy was &gt;3x10^51 erg, at thehigh end of grb energies. despite the brightness in x rays, only deep limitscould be placed by swift-uvot at optical/uv wavelengths. thus, this grb was"truly dark", with the optical-to-x-ray spectrum violating the synchrotronlimit. the optical and x-ray observations are consistent either with anabsorbed event or with a high-redshift one. to obey the ghirlanda relation, amoderate/large redshift z&gt;4.5 is required.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0602236	grb 050505: a high redshift burst discovered by swift	we report the discovery and subsequent multi-wavelength afterglow behaviourof the high redshift (z = 4.27) gamma ray burst grb 050505. this burst is thethird most distant burst, measured by spectroscopic redshift, discovered aftergrb 000131 (z = 4.50) and grb 050904 (z = 6.29). grb 050505 is a long grb witha multipeaked gamma-ray light curve, with a duration of t_90 = 63+/-2 s and aninferred isotropic release in gamma-rays of ~4.44 x 10^53 ergs in the 1-10^4kev rest frame energy range. the swift x-ray telescope followed the afterglowfor 14 days, detecting two breaks in the light curve at 7.4(+/-1.5) ks and 58.0(+9.9/-15.4) ks after the burst trigger. the power law decay slopes before,between and after these breaks were 0.25 (+0.16/-0.17), 1.17 (+0.08/-0.09) and1.97 (+0.27/-0.28) respectively. the light curve can also be fit with a`smoothly broken' power law model with a break observed at ~ t+18.5 ks, withdecay slopes of ~0.4 and ~1.8 before and after the break respectively. thex-ray afterglow shows no spectral variation over the course of the swiftobservations, being well fit with a single power law of photon index ~1.90.this behaviour is expected for the cessation of continued energisation of theism shock followed by a break caused by a jet, either uniform or structured.neither break is consistent with a cooling break. the spectral energydistribution indeed shows the cooling frequency to be below the x-ray but aboveoptical frequencies. the optical -- x-ray spectrum also shows that there issignificant x-ray absorption in excess of that due to our galaxy but verylittle optical/uv extinction, with e(b-v) ~0.10 for a smc-like extinctioncurve.

astro-ph;0602497	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments. indeed, swift-bat triggered on aprecursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed swift to repointthe narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burstoccurred. grb 060124 also triggered konus-wind, which observed the promptemission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2mev). thanks to these exceptionalcircumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission canbe studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges. while the x-ray emission(0.2-10kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows adifferent pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset ofexternal shocks. the prompt grb spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. as observed inseveral long grbs, significant lags are measured between the hard- andlow-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades inenergy. the grb peaks are also much broader at soft energies. this is relatedto the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assumingthat the electron spectral index softened with time. the burst energy(e_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (e_p~300kev) make grb 060124consistent with the amati relation. the x-ray afterglow is characterized by adecay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

astro-ph;0702603	grb 060714: no clear dividing line between prompt emission and x-ray  flares	the long gamma-ray burst grb 060714 was observed to exhibit a series of fivex-ray flares beginning ~70 s after the burst trigger t0 and continuing until t0+ ~200 s. the first two flares were detected by the burst alert telescope (bat)on the swift satellite, before swift had slewed to the burst location, whilethe last three flares were strongly detected by the x-ray telescope (xrt) butonly weakly detected by the bat. this burst provides an unusual opportunity totrack a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. the flares werevery similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fallcomponents, and in most cases significant sub-structure. the flares also showedstrong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. the small timescale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with anexternal shock origin for the flares, and support instead late time sporadicactivity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events withinthe outflow. we show that the flares in grb 060714 cannot be the result ofinternal shocks in which the contrast in the lorentz factor of the collidingshells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties inmost swift grbs. the morphological similarity of the flares and the promptemission and the gradual and continual evolution of the flares with time makesit difficult and arbitrary to draw a dividing line between the prompt emissionand the flares.

astro-ph;0703150	swift detection of all previously undetected blazars in a micro-wave  flux-limited sample of wmap foreground sources	almost the totality of the bright foreground sources in the wmap cmb maps areblazars, a class of sources that show usually also x-ray emission. however, 23objects in a flux-limited sample of 140 blazars of the wmap catalog (firstyear) were never reported before as x-ray sources. we present here the resultsof 41 swift observations which led to the detection of all these 23 blazars inthe 0.3-10 kev band. we conclude that all micro-wave selected blazars are x-rayemitters and that the distribution of the micro-wave to x-ray spectral slope$\alpha_{mu x}$ of lbl blazars is very narrow, confirming that the x-ray fluxof most blazars is a very good estimator of their micro-wave emission. thex-ray spectral shape of all the objects that were observed long enough to allowspectral analysis is flat and consistent with inverse compton emission withinthe commonly accepted view where the radiation from blazars is emitted in asychrotron-inverse-compton scenario. we predict that all blazars and most radiogalaxies above the sensitivity limit of the wmap and of the planck cmb missionsare x-ray sources detectable by the present generation of x-ray satellites. anhypothetical all-sky soft x-ray survey with sensitivity of approximately$10^{-15}$ erg/s would be crucial to locate and remove over 100,000 blazarsfrom cmb temperature and polarization maps and therefore accurately clean theprimordial cmb signal from the largest population of extragalactic foregroundcontaminants.

astro-ph;0703491	roxa j081009.9+384757.0: a $10^{47}$ erg/s blazar with hard x-ray  synchrotron peak or a new type of radio loud agn?	we report the discovery of roxa j081009.9+384757.0 = sdss j081009.9+384757.0,a z=3.95 blazar with a highly unusual spectral energy distribution (sed). thisobject was first noticed as a probable high $f_x/f_r$, high-luminosity blazarwithin the error region of a $\approx 10^{-12}$ erg/s cm$^2$ rosat sourcewhich, however, also included a much brighter late-type star. we describe theresults of a recent swift observation that establishes beyond doubt that thecorrect counterpart of the x-ray source is the flat spectrum radio quasar. witha luminosity well in excess of $10^{47}$ erg/s, roxa j081009.9+384757.0 istherefore one of the most luminous blazars known. we consider variouspossibilities for the nature of the electromagnetic emission from this source.in particular, we show that the sed is consistent with that of a blazar withsynchrotron power peaking in the hard x-ray band. if this is indeed the case,the combination of high-luminosity and synchrotron peak in the hard-x-ray bandcontradicts the claimed anti-correlation between luminosity and position of thesynchrotron peak usually referred to as the "blazar sequence". an alternativepossibility is that the x-rays are not due to synchrotron emission, in thiscase the very peculiar sed of roxa j081009.9+384757.0 would make it the firstexample of a new class of radio loud agn.

0811.1444	a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background	we present a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background (cxrb) in the1.5-7 kev energy band, performed by exploiting the swift x-ray telescope (xrt)data archive. we also present a cxrb spectral model in a wider energy band(1.5-200 kev), obtained by combining these data with the recently publishedswift-bat measurement. from the xrt archive we collect a complete sample of 126high galactic latitude gamma-ray burst (grb) follow-up observations. thisprovides a total exposure of 7.5 ms and a sky-coverage of 7 square degreeswhich represents a serendipitous survey, well suited for a direct measurementof the cxrb in the 1.5-10 kev interval. our work is based on a completecharacterization of the instrumental background and an accurate measurement ofthe stray-light contamination and vignetting calibration. we find that the cxrbspectrum in the 1.5-7 kev energy band can be equally well fitted by a singlepower-law with photon index gamma=1.47+/-0.07 or a single power-law with photonindex gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and an exponential roll-off at 41 kev. the measuredflux in the 2-10 kev energy band is 2.18+/-0.13 e-11 erg/(cm2 s deg2) in the2-10 kev band. combining swift-xrt with swift-bat (15-200 kev) we find that, inthe 1.5-200 kev band, the cxrb spectrum can be well described by twosmoothly-joined power laws with the energy break at 29.0+/-0.5 kevcorresponding to a nu f_nu peak located at 22.4+/-0.4 kev. taking advantage ofboth the swift high energy instruments (xrt and bat), we produce an analyticaldescription of the cxrb spectrum over a wide (1.5-200 kev) energy band. thismodel is marginally consistent with the heao1 measurement (~10% higher atenergies higher than 20 kev, while it is significantly (30%) higher at lowenergies (2-10 kev).

0811.4246	modelling the spectral response of the swift-xrt ccd camera: experience  learnt from in-flight calibration	(abbreviated) we show that the xrt spectral response calibration wascomplicated by various energy offsets in photon counting (pc) and windowedtiming (wt) modes related to the way the ccd is operated in orbit (variation intemperature during observations, contamination by optical light from the sunlitearth and increase in charge transfer inefficiency). we describe how theseeffects can be corrected for in the ground processing software. we show thatthe low-energy response, the redistribution in spectra of absorbed sources, andthe modelling of the line profile have been significantly improved since launchby introducing empirical corrections in our code when it was not possible touse a physical description. we note that the increase in cti became noticeablein june 2006 (i.e. 14 months after launch), but the evidence of a more seriousdegradation in spectroscopic performance (line broadening and change in thelow-energy response) due to large charge traps (i.e. faults in the si crystal)became more significant after march 2007. we describe efforts to handle suchchanges in the spectral response. finally, we show that the commanded increasein the substrate voltage from 0 to 6v on 2007 august 30 reduced the darkcurrent, enabling the collection of useful science data at higher ccdtemperature (up to -50c). we also briefly describe the plan to recalibrate thexrt response files at this new voltage.

0812.3662	methods and results of an automatic analysis of a complete sample of  swift-xrt observations of grbs	we present a homogeneous x-ray analysis of all 318 gamma ray bursts detectedby the x-ray telescope on the swift satellite up to 2008 july 23; thisrepresents the largest sample of x-ray grb data published to date. in sections2--3 we detail the methods which the swift-xrt team has developed to producethe enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented inthis paper. software using these methods continues to create such products forall new grbs observed by the swift-xrt. we also detail web-based tools allowingusers to create these products for any object observed by the xrt, not justgrbs. in sections 4--6 we present the results of our analysis of grbs,including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectralproperties of the sample. we demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlyingbehaviour which can produce a range of light curve morphologies, and attempt tointerpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission.we find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our datawith the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days toweeks.
