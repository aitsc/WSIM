0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0912.3597	pinpointing the tev gamma-ray emission region in m87 using tev and 43  ghz radio monitoring	the tev radio galaxy m87 is the first radio galaxy detected in the tevregime. the structure of its jet, which is not pointing towards our line ofsight, is spatially resolved in x-ray (by chandra), optical and radioobservations. in 2008, the three main atmospheric cherenkov telescopeobservatories veritas, magic and h.e.s.s. coordinated their observations in ajoint campaign from january to may with a total observation time of approx. 120hours. in february, strong and rapid day-scale tev flares were detected. vlbamonitoring observations during the same period showed that the 43 ghz radioflux density of the unresolved core began to rise at the time of the tev flaresand eventually reached levels above any previously seen with vlbi. new jetcomponents appeared during the flare. the localization accuracy of the tevinstruments of many arcseconds, even for strong sources, is inadequate toconstrain the origin of the emission in the inner jets of agns. for m87, with a6 billion solar mass black hole and a distance of 16.7 mpc, the vlba resolutioninstead corresponds to 30 by 60 schwarzschild radii. this is starting toresolve the jet collimation region. the temporal coincidence of the tev andradio flares indicates that they are related and provides the first directevidence that the tev radiation from this source is produced within a few tensof rs of the radio core, thought to be coincident to within the vlba resolutionwith the black hole.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous vhe gamma-ray, chandra x-ray,and vlba radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source ofvhe emission, in contrast to the 2005 vhe flare that was simultaneous with anx-ray flare in the hst-1 knot. in 2009, veritas continued its monitoring of m87and marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% ofthe crab nebula. no vhe flaring activity was observed in 2009.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1109.0050	veritas observations of gamma-ray bursts detected by swift	we present the results of sixteen swift-triggered grb follow-up observationstaken with the veritas telescope array from january, 2007 to june, 2009. themedian energy threshold and response time of these observations was 260 gev and320 s, respectively. observations had an average duration of 90 minutes. eachburst is analyzed independently in two modes: over the whole duration of theobservations and again over a shorter time scale determined by the maximumveritas sensitivity to a burst with a t^-1.5 time profile. this temporal modelis characteristic of grb afterglows with high-energy, long-lived emission thathave been detected by the large area telescope (lat) on-board the fermisatellite. no significant vhe gamma-ray emission was detected and upper limitsabove the veritas threshold energy are calculated. the veritas upper limits arecorrected for gamma-ray extinction by the extragalactic background light (ebl)and interpreted in the context of the kev emission detected by swift. for somebursts the vhe emission must have less power than the kev emission, placingconstraints on inverse compton models of vhe emission.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1401.2828	observations of the unidentified gamma-ray source tev j2032+4130 by  veritas	tev j2032+4130 was the first unidentified source discovered at very highenergies (vhe; e $&gt;$ 100 gev), with no obvious counterpart in any otherwavelength. it is also the first extended source to be observed in vhe gammarays. following its discovery, intensive observational campaigns have beencarried out in all wavelengths in order to understand the nature of the object,which have met with limited success. we report here on a deep observation oftev j2032+4130, based on 48.2 hours of data taken from 2009 to 2012 by theveritas (very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system) experiment.the source is detected at 8.7 standard deviations ($\sigma$) and is found to beextended and asymmetric with a width of 9.5$^{\prime}$$\pm$1.2$^{\prime}$ alongthe major axis and 4.0$^{\prime}$$\pm$0.5$^{\prime}$ along the minor axis. thespectrum is well described by a differential power law with an index of 2.10$\pm$ 0.14$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 0.21$_{sys}$ and a normalization of (9.5 $\pm$1.6$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 2.2$_{sys}$) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev. we interpret these results in the context of multiwavelengthscenarios which particularly favor the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) interpretation.

1405.1082	a strong radio brightening at the jet base of m87 during the elevated  very-high-energy gamma-ray state in 2012	we report our intensive radio monitoring observations of the jet in m87 withthe vlbi exploration of radio astrometry (vera) and the european vlbi network(evn) from february 2011 to october 2012, together with contemporaneoushigh-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the fermi-lat. during thisperiod, an elevated level of the m87 flux is reported at vhe gamma rays. wedetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolvedjet base (radio core) with vera at 22 and 43ghz coincident with the vheactivity. meanwhile, we confirmed with evn at 5ghz that hst-1 (an alternativegamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its fluxdensity and structure. these results in the radio bands strongly suggest thatthe vhe gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or56 schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. we furtherconducted vera astrometry for the m87 core during the flaring period, anddetected core shifts between 22 and 43ghz. we also discovered a clearfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5ghz; theradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a largeramplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at22 and 43ghz. this indicates that a new radio-emitting component was creatednear the black hole in the period of the vhe event, and then propagated outwardwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. by combining these results,we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived asub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. this value is significantly slower thanthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during theprominent vhe flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger vhe activitycan be associated with the production of the higher lorentz factor jet.

1409.6214	analyzing the data from x-ray polarimeters with stokes parameters	x-ray polarimetry promises to deliver unique information about the geometryof the inner accretion flow of astrophysical black holes and the nature ofmatter and electromagnetism in and around neutron stars. in this paper, wediscuss the possibility to use stokes parameters - a commonly used tool inradio, infrared, and optical polarimetry - to analyze the data from x-raypolarimeters such as scattering polarimeters and photoelectric effectpolarimeters, which measure the linear polarization of the detected x-rays.based on the azimuthal scattering angle (in the case of a scatteringpolarimeter) or the azimuthal component of the angle of the electron ejection(in the case of a photoelectric effect polarimeter), the stokes parameters canbe calculated for each event recorded in the detector. owing to the additivenature of stokes parameters, the analysis reduces to adding the stokesparameters of the individual events and subtracting the stokes parameterscharacterizing the background (if present). the main strength of this kind ofanalysis is that the errors on the stokes parameters can be computed easily andare well behaved - in stark contrast of the errors on the polarization fractionand polarization direction. we demonstrate the power of the stokes analysis byderiving several useful formulae, e.g. the expected error on the polarizationfraction and polarization direction for a detection of $n_s$ signal and$n_{bg}$ background events, the optimal observation times of the signal andbackground regions in the presence of non-negligible background contaminationof the signal, and the minimum detectable polarization (mdp) that can beachieved when following this prescription.

1410.5367	constraints on very high energy emission from grb 130427a	prompt emission from the very fluent and nearby (z=0.34) gamma-ray burst grb130427a was detected by several orbiting telescopes and by ground-based,wide-field-of-view optical transient monitors. apart from the intensity andproximity of this grb, it is exceptional due to the extremely long-livedhigh-energy (100 mev to 100 gev) gamma-ray emission, which was detected by thelarge area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope for ~70 ks afterthe initial burst. the persistent, hard-spectrum, high-energy emission suggeststhat the highest-energy gamma rays may have been produced via synchrotronself-compton processes though there is also evidence that the high-energyemission may instead be an extension of the synchrotron spectrum. veritas, aground-based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array, began follow-upobservations of grb 130427a ~71 ks (~20 hr) after the onset of the burst. thegrb was not detected with veritas; however, the high elevation of theobservations, coupled with the low redshift of the grb, make veritas a verysensitive probe of the emission from grb 130427a for e &gt; 100 gev. thenon-detection and consequent upper limit derived place constraints on thesynchrotron self-compton model of high-energy gamma-ray emission from thisburst.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1412.6861	a strong radio brightening at the jet base of m87 during the elevated  very-high-energy gamma-ray state in 2012	the nearby radio galaxy m87 offers a unique opportunity for exploring theconnection between gamma-ray production and jet formation at an unprecedentedlinear resolution. however, the origin and location of the gamma-rays in thissource is still elusive. based on previous radio/tev correlation events, theunresolved jet base (radio core) and the peculiar knot hst-1 at &gt;120 pc fromthe nucleus are proposed as candidate site(s) of gamma-ray production. here wereport our intensive, high-resolution radio monitoring observations of the m87jet with the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry (vera) and the european vlbinetwork (evn) from february 2011 to october 2012. during this period, anelevated level of the m87 flux is reported at tev with veritas. we detected aremarkable flux increase in the radio core with vera at 22/43 ghz coincidentwith the vhe activity. meanwhile, hst-1 remained quiescent in terms of its fluxdensity and structure at radio. these results strongly suggest that the tevgamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03 pc(projected) from the central supermassive black hole.
