0903.0858	evidence for an edge-on disk around the young star mwc 778 from infrared  imaging and polarimetry	mwc 778 is an unusual and little-studied young stellar object located in theic 2144 nebula. recent spectroscopy by herbig and vacca (2008) suggested thepresence of an edge-on circumstellar disk around it. we present near-infraredadaptive optics imaging polarimetry and mid-infrared imaging which directlyconfirm the suspected nearly-edge-on disk around mwc 778 (i ~ 70-80 degrees)plus reveal a more extensive envelope pierced by bipolar outflow cavities. inaddition, our mid-infrared images and near-infrared polarization maps detect aspiral-shaped structure surrounding mwc 778, with arms that extend beyond 6" oneither side of the star.  although mwc 778 has previously been classified as an herbig ae/be star, theproperties of its central source (including its spectral type) remain fairlyuncertain. herbig &amp; vacca (2008) suggested an f or g spectral type based on thepresence of metallic absorption lines in the optical spectrum, which impliesthat mwc 778 may belong to the fairly rare class of intermediate-mass t tauristars (imttss) which are the evolutionary precursors to herbig ae/be objects.yet its integrated bolometric luminosity, &gt; 750 l_sun (for an assumed distanceof 1 kpc) is surprisingly high for an f or g spectral type, even for an imtts.we speculate on several possible explanations for this discrepancy, includingits true distance being much closer than 1 kpc, the presence of a binarycompanion, and/or a non-stellar origin for the observed absorption lines.

0706.3935	feedback in the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/9): i. high-resolution  infrared spectroscopy of winds from super star clusters	we present high-resolution (r ~ 24,600) near-ir spectroscopy of the youngestsuper star clusters (sscs) in the prototypical starburst merger, the antennaegalaxies. these sscs are young (3-7 myr old) and massive (10^5 - 10^7 m_sun fora kroupa imf) and their spectra are characterized by broad, extended br-gammaemission, so we refer to them as emission-line clusters (elcs) to distinguishthem from older sscs. the brgamma lines of most elcs have supersonic widths(60-110 km/s fwhm) and non-gaussian wings whose velocities exceed the clusters'escape velocities. this high-velocity unbound gas is flowing out in winds thatare powered by the clusters' massive o and w-r stars over the course of atleast several crossing times. the large sizes of some elcs relative to those ofolder sscs may be due to expansion caused by these outflows; many of the elcsmay not survive as bound stellar systems, but rather dissipate rapidly into thefield population. the observed tendency of older elcs to be more compact thanyoung ones is consistent with the preferential survival of the mostconcentrated clusters at a given age.

0906.3010	speckle suppression through dual imaging polarimetry, and a ground-based  image of the hr 4796a circumstellar disk	we demonstrate the versatility of a dual imaging polarimeter working intandem with a lyot coronagraph and adaptive optics to suppress the highlystatic speckle noise pattern--the greatest hindrance to ground-based directimaging of planets and disks around nearby stars. using a double differencetechnique with the polarimetric data, we quantify the level of specklesuppression, and hence improved sensitivity, by placing an ensemble ofartificial faint companions into real data, with given total brightness andpolarization. for highly polarized sources within 0.5 arcsec, we show that weachieve 3 to 4 magnitudes greater sensitivity through polarimetric specklesuppression than simply using a coronagraph coupled to a high-order adaptiveoptics system. using such a polarimeter with a classical lyot coronagraph atthe 3.63m aeos telescope, we have obtained a 6.5 sigma detection in the h-bandof the 76 au diameter circumstellar debris disk around the star hr 4796a. ourdata represent the first definitive, ground-based, near-ir polarimetric imageof the hr 4796a debris disk and clearly show the two outer ansae of the disk,evident in hubble space telescope nicmos/stis imaging. we derive a lower limitto the fractional linear polarization of 29% caused by dust grains in the disk.in addition, we fit simple morphological models of optically thin disks to ourdata allowing us to constrain the dust disk scale height to 2.5{+5.0}_{-1.3} auand scattering asymmetry parameter (g=0.20^{+.07}_{-.10}). these values areconsistent with several lines of evidence suggesting that the hr 4796a disk isdominated by a micron-sized dust population, and are indeed typical of disks intransition between those surrounding the herbig ae stars to those associatedwith vega-like stars.

0909.4306	orbital constraints on the beta pic inner planet candidate with keck  adaptive optics	a point source observed 8 au in projection from beta pictoris in l' (3.8micron) imaging in 2003 has been recently presented as a planet candidate. herewe show the results of l'-band adaptive optics imaging obtained at keckobservatory in 2008. we do not detect beta pic b beyond a limiting radius of0.29 arcsec, or 5.5 au in projection, from the star. if beta pic b is anorbiting planet, then it has moved &gt;=0.12 arcsec (2.4 au in projection) closerto the star in the five years separating the two epochs of observation. weexamine the range of orbital parameters consistent with the observations,including likely bounds from the locations of previously inferred planetesimalbelts. we find a family of low-eccentricity orbits with semimajor axes ~8-9 authat are completely allowed, as well as a broad region of orbits with e&lt;~0.2,a&gt;~10 au that are allowed if the apparent motion of the planet was towards thestar in 2003. we compare this allowed space with predictions of the planetaryorbital elements from the literature. additionally, we show how similarobservations in the next several years can further constrain the space ofallowed orbits. non-detections of the source through 2013 will exclude theinterpretation of the candidate as a planet orbiting between the 6.4 and 16 auplanetesimal belts.

0910.5223	hubble space telescope optical imaging of the eroding debris disk hd  61005	we present hubble space telescope optical coronagraphic polarization imagingobservations of the dusty debris disk hd 61005. the scattered light intensityimage and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clearasymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction withthe ambient interstellar medium. the combination of our new data with thepublished 1.1 micron discovery image shows that the grains are blue scatteringwith no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantlysub-micron sized grains. we investigate possible explanations that couldaccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. previous work hassuggested that hd 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually denseinterstellar cloud. however, limits on the intervening interstellar gas columndensity from an optical spectrum of hd 61005 in the na i d lines render thispossibility unlikely. instead, hd 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.this mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within atypical cloud crossing time. for a counterintuitive relative flowdirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generatedby these distortions can very roughly approximate the hd 61005 morphology.future observational studies constraining the direction of the relativeinterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for futuremodeling. independent of the interpretation for hd 61005, we expect thatinterstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed inother debris disk systems, such as hd 15115 and delta-velorum.

0707.2394	laser guide star adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of a  tightly collimated bipolar jet from the herbig ae star lkha 233	we have used the integral field spectrograph osiris and laser guide staradaptive optics at keck observatory to obtain high angular resolution (0.06"),moderate spectral resolution (r ~ 3800) images of the bipolar jet from theherbig ae star lkha 233, seen in near-ir [fe ii] emission at 1.600 &amp; 1.644microns. this jet is narrow and tightly collimated, with an opening angle ofonly 9 degrees, and has an average radial velocity of ~ 100 km/s. the jet andcounterjet are asymmetric, with the red-shifted jet much clumpier than itscounterpart at the angular resolution of our observations. the observedproperties are in general similar to jets seen around t tauri stars, though ithas a relatively large mass flux of (1.2e-7 +- 0.3e-7) m_sun/year, near thehigh end of the observed mass flux range around t tauri stars. we alsospatially resolve an inclined circumstellar disk around lkha 233, whichobscures the star from direct view. by comparison with numerical radiativetransfer disk models, we estimate the disk midplane to be inclined i = 65 +- 5degrees relative to the plane of the sky. since the star is seen only inscattered light at near-infrared wavelengths, we detect only a small fractionof its intrinsic flux. because previous estimates of its stellar properties didnot account for this, either lkha 233 must be located closer than thepreviously believed, or its true luminosity must be greater than previouslysupposed, consistent with its being a ~4 m_sun star near the stellar birthline.

0707.3295	a ring of warm dust in the hd 32297 debris disk	we report the detection of a ring of warm dust in the edge-on disksurrounding hd 32297 with the gemini-n/michelle mid-infrared imager. ourn'-band image shows elongated structure consistent with the orientation of thescattered-light disk. the fnu(11.2 um) = 49.9+/-2.1 mjy flux is significantlyabove the 28.2+/-0.6 mjy photosphere. subtraction of the stellar point spreadfunction reveals a bilobed structure with peaks 0.5"-0.6" from the star. ananalysis of the stellar component of the sed suggests a spectral type laterthan a0, in contrast to commonly cited literature values. we fitthree-dimensional, single-size grain models of an optically thin dust ring toour image and the sed using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm in a bayesianframework. the best-fit effective grain sizes are submicron, suggesting thesame dust population is responsible for the bulk of the scattered light. theinner boundary of the warm dust is located 0.5"-0.7" (~65 au) from the star,which is approximately cospatial with the outer boundary of the scattered-lightasymmetry inward of 0.5". the addition of a separate component of larger,cooler grains that provide a portion of the 60 um flux improves both thefidelity of the model fit and consistency with the slopes of thescattered-light brightness profiles. previous indirect estimates of the stellarage (~30 myr) indicate the dust is composed of debris. the peak verticaloptical depths in our models (~0.3-1 x 1e-2) imply that grain-grain collisionslikely play a significant role in dust dynamics and evolution. submicron grainscan survive radiation pressure blow-out if they are icy and porous. similarly,the inferred warm temperatures (130-200 k) suggest that ice sublimation mayplay a role in truncating the inner disk.

1007.3981	chandra x-ray detection of the enigmatic field star bp psc	bp psc is a remarkable emission-line field star that is orbited by a dustydisk and drives a parsec-scale system of jets. we report the detection by thechandra x-ray observatory of a weak x-ray point source coincident with thecentroids of optical/ir and submillimeter continuum emission at bp psc. as thestar's photosphere is obscured throughout the visible and near-infrared, thechandra x-ray source likely represents the first detection of bp psc itself.the x-rays most likely originate with magnetic activity at bp psc and hence canbe attributed either to a stellar corona or to star-disk interactions. the logof the ratio of x-ray to bolometric luminosity (log(l_x/l_{bol}) lies in therange -5.8 to -4.2. this is smaller than log(l_x/l_{bol}) ratios typical oflow-mass, pre-main sequence stars, but is well within the log(l_x/l_{bol})range observed for rapidly-rotating (fk com-type) g giant stars. hence, thechandra results favor an exotic model wherein the disk/jet system of bp psc isthe result of its very recently engulfing a companion star or giant planet, asthe primary star ascended the giant branch.

1112.1078	two ten-billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of giant  elliptical galaxies	observational work conducted over the last few decades indicates that allmassive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. although theluminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early universesuggest that some are powered by black holes with masses greater than 10billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in thenearby universe. the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 hosts the hitherto mostmassive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. here wereport that ngc 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance fromearth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billionsolar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present inngc 4889, the brightest galaxy in the coma cluster (at a distance of 103megaparsecs). these two black holes are significantly more massive thanpredicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between blackhole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the hostgalaxy. although these correlations remain useful for predicting black holemasses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest thatdifferent evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxiesand their black holes.

1112.3666	the vast survey -- ii. orbital motion monitoring of a-type star  multiples	as a part of our ongoing volume-limited a-star (vast) adaptive optics survey,we have obtained observations of 26 binary systems with projected separations&lt;100 au, 13 of which have sufficient historical measurements to allow forrefinement of their orbital elements. for each system with an estimated orbit,the dynamical system mass obtained was compared with the system mass estimatedfrom mass-magnitude relations. discrepancies between the dynamical andtheoretical system mass can be explained by the presence of a previouslyunresolved spectroscopic component, or by a non-solar metallicity of thesystem. using this approach to infer the presence of additional companions, alower limit to the fraction of binaries, triples, and quadruples can beestimated as 39, 46, and 15 per cent, for systems with at least one companionwithin 100 au. the fraction of multiple systems with three or more componentsshows a relative increase compared to the fraction for solar-type primariesresolved in previous volume-limited surveys. the observations have alsorevealed a pair of potentially young ($&lt;$100 myr) m-dwarf companions, whichwould make an ideal benchmark for the theoretical models during the pre-mainsequence contraction phase for m-dwarfs. in addition to those systems withorbit fits, we report 13 systems for which further orbital monitoringobservations are required, 11 of which are newly resolved as a part of the vastsurvey.

1305.2222	stis coronagraphic imaging of fomalhaut: main belt structure and the  orbit of fomalhaut b	we present new optical coronagraphic data of the bright star fomalhautobtained with the hst in 2010/2012 using stis. fomalhaut b is recovered at bothepochs to high significance. the observations include the discoveries oftenuous nebulosity beyond the main dust belt detected to at least 209 auprojected radius and a ~50 au wide azimuthal gap in the belt northward of fomb. the morphology of fomalhaut b appears elliptical in the stis detections. weshow that residual noise in the processed data can plausibly result in pointsources appearing extended. a mcmc analysis demonstrates that the orbit of fomb is highly eccentric, with e=0.8+/-0.1, a=177+/-68 au, and q = 32+/-24 au. fomb is apsidally aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutualinclination 36 deg or less. fomalhaut b's orbit is belt-crossing in projection,but only 12% of possible orbits have nodes within a 25 au wide belt annulus(133-158 au). the high e invokes a dynamical history where fom b may haveexperienced a significant dynamical interaction with a hypothetical planetfomalhaut c, and the current orbital configuration may be relativelyshort-lived. the new value for the periastron distance diminishes the hillradius of fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planetwould be sheared and dynamically heated at periapse. we argue that fom b'sminimum mass is that of a dwarf planet in order for a circumplanetary satellitesystem to remain bound to a sufficient radius from the planet to be consistentwith the dust scattered light hypothesis. fom b may be optically bright becausethe recent passage through periapse and/or the ascending node has increased theerosion rates of planetary satellites. in the coplanar case, fomalhaut b willcollide with the main belt around 2032, and the subsequent emergent phenomenamay help determine its physical nature.

1310.7026	modeling self-subtraction in angular differential imaging: application  to the hd 32297 debris disk	we present a new technique for forward-modeling self-subtraction of spatiallyextended emission in observations processed with angular differential imaging(adi) algorithms. high-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks islimited by quasi-static speckle noise and adi is commonly used to suppressthose speckles. however, the application of adi can result in self-subtractionof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. this signalattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk'ssurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physicalprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. to compensate for thisattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of theself-subtraction function at each separation. as a proof of concept, we applyour method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron keck ao nirc2 scattered-light observations ofthe hd 32297 debris disk reduced using a variant of the "locally optimizedcombination of images" (loci) algorithm. we are able to recover disk surfacebrightness that was otherwise lost to self-subtraction and produce simplifiedmodels of the brightness distribution as it appears with and withoutself-subtraction. from the latter models, we extract radial profiles for thedisk's brightness, width, midplane position, and color that are unbiased byself-subtraction. our analysis of these measurements indicates a break in thebrightness profile power law at r~110 au and a disk width that increases withseparation from the star. we also verify disk curvature that displaces themidplane by up to 30 au towards the northwest relative to a straight fiducialmidplane.

1407.2301	gemini planet imager observational calibrations i: overview of the gpi  data reduction pipeline	the gemini planet imager (gpi) has as its science instrument an infraredintegral field spectrograph/polarimeter (ifs). integral field spectrographs arescientificially powerful but require sophisticated data reduction systems. forgpi to achieve its scientific goals of exoplanet and disk characterization, ifsdata must be reconstructed into high quality astrometrically andphotometrically accurate datacubes in both spectral and polarization modes, viaflexible software that is usable by the broad gemini community. the datareduction pipeline developed by the gpi instrument team to meet these needs isnow publicly available following gpi's commissioning.  this paper, the first of a series, provides a broad overview of gpi datareduction, summarizes key steps, and presents the overall software frameworkand implementation. subsequent papers describe in more detail the algorithmsnecessary for calibrating gpi data. the gpi data reduction pipeline is opensource, available from planetimager.org, and will continue to be enhancedthroughout the life of the instrument. it implements an extensive suite of taskprimitives that can be assembled into reduction recipes to produce calibrateddatasets ready for scientific analysis. angular, spectral, and polarimetricdifferential imaging are supported. graphical tools automate the production andediting of recipes, an integrated calibration database manages reference files,and an interactive data viewer customized for high contrast imaging allows forexploration and manipulation of data.

1407.2308	gemini planet imager observational calibrations viii: characterization  and role of satellite spots	the gemini planet imager (gpi) combines extreme adaptive optics, an integralfield spectrograph, and a high performance coronagraph to directly imageextrasolar planets in the near-infrared. because the coronagraph blocks most ofthe light from the star, it prevents the properties of the host star from beingmeasured directly. instead, satellite spots, which are created by diffractionfrom a square grid in the pupil plane, can be used to locate the star andextract its spectrum. we describe the techniques implemented into the gpi datareduction pipeline to measure the properties of the satellite spots and discussthe precision of the reconstructed astrometry and spectrophotometry of theocculted star. we find the astrometric precision of the satellite spots in an$h$-band datacube to be $0.05$ pixels and is best when individual satellitespots have a signal to noise ratio (snr) of $&gt; 20$. in regards to satellitespot spectrophotometry, we find that the total flux from the satellite spots isstable to $\sim 7\%$ and scales linearly with central star brightness and thatthe shape of the satellite spot spectrum varies on the $2\%$ level.

1407.2314	the integral field spectrograph for the gemini planet imager	the gemini planet imager (gpi) is a complex optical system designed todirectly detect the self-emission of young planets within two arcseconds oftheir host stars. after suppressing the starlight with an advanced ao systemand apodized coronagraph, the dominant residual contamination in the focalplane are speckles from the atmosphere and optical surfaces. since speckles arediffractive in nature their positions in the field are strongly wavelengthdependent, while an actual companion planet will remain at fixed separation. bycomparing multiple images at different wavelengths taken simultaneously, we canfreeze the speckle pattern and extract the planet light adding an order ofmagnitude of contrast. to achieve a bandpass of 20%, sufficient to performspeckle suppression, and to observe the entire two arcsecond field of view atdiffraction limited sampling, we designed and built an integral fieldspectrograph with extremely low wavefront error and almost no chromaticaberration. the spectrograph is fully cryogenic and operates in the wavelengthrange 1 to 2.4 microns with five selectable filters. a prism is used to producea spectral resolution of 45 in the primary detection band and maintain highthroughput. based on the osiris spectrograph at keck, we selected to use alenslet-based spectrograph to achieve an rms wavefront error of approximately25 nm. over 36,000 spectra are taken simultaneously and reassembled into imagecubes that have roughly 192x192 spatial elements and contain between 11 and 20spectral channels. the primary dispersion prism can be replaced with awollaston prism for dual polarization measurements. the spectrograph also has apupil-viewing mode for alignment and calibration.

0803.3629	the solar-system-scale disk around ab aurigae	the young star ab aurigae is surrounded by a complex combination of gas-richand dust dominated structures. the inner disk which has not been studiedpreviously at sufficient resolution and imaging dynamic range seems to containvery little gas inside a radius of least 130 astronomical units (au) from thestar. using adaptive-optics coronagraphy and polarimetry we have imaged thedust in an annulus between 43 and 302 au from the star, a region never seenbefore. an azimuthal gap in an annulus of dust at a radius of 102 au, alongwith a clearing at closer radii inside this annulus, suggests the formation ofat least one small body at an orbital distance of about 100 au. this structureseems consistent with crude models of mean motion resonances, or accumulationof material at two of the lagrange points relative to the putative object andthe star. we also report a low significance detection of a point source in thisouter annulus of dust. this source may be an overdensity in the disk due todust accreting onto an unseen companion. an alternate interpretation suggeststhat the object's mass is between 5 and 37 times the mass of jupiter. theresults have implications for circumstellar disk dynamics and planet formation.

astro-ph;0002335	discovery of an obscured broad line region in the high redshift radio  galaxy mrc 2025-218	this paper presents infrared spectra taken with the newly commissionednirspec spectrograph on the keck ii telescope of the high redshift radio galaxymrc 2025-218 (z=2.63) these observations represent the deepest infrared spectraof a radio galaxy to date and have allowed for the detection of hbeta, [oiii](4959/5007), [oi] (6300), halpha, [nii] (6548/6583) and [sii] (6716/6713). thehalpha emission is very broad (fwhm = 9300 km/s) and luminous (2.6x10^44ergs/s) and it is very comparable to the line widths and strengths of radioloud quasars at the same redshift. this strongly supports agn unificationmodels linking radio galaxies and quasars, although we discuss some of theoutstanding differences. the [oiii] (5007) line is extremely strong and hasextended emission with large relative velocities to the nucleus. we also derivethat if the extended emission is due to star formation, each knot has a starformation rate comparable to a lyman break galaxy at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0004367	theoretical predictions for surface brightness fluctuations and  implications for stellar populations of elliptical galaxies	(abridged) we present new theoretical predictions for surface brightnessfluctuations (sbfs) using models optimized for this purpose. our predictionsagree well with sbf data for globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. weprovide refined theoretical calibrations and k-corrections needed to use sbfsas standard candles. we suggest that sbf distance measurements can be improvedby using a filter around 1 micron and calibrating i-band sbfs with theintegrated v-k galaxy color. we also show that current sbf data provide usefulconstraints on population synthesis models, and we suggest sbf-based tests forfuture models. the data favor specific choices of evolutionary tracks andspectra in the models among the several choices allowed by comparisons based ononly integrated light. in addition, the tightness of the empirical i-band sbfcalibration suggests that model uncertainties in post-main sequence lifetimesare less than +/-50% and that the imf in ellipticals is not much steeper thanthat in the solar neighborhood. finally, we analyze the potential of sbfs forprobing unresolved stellar populations. we find that optical/near-ir sbfs aremuch more sensitive to metallicity than to age. therefore, sbf magnitudes andcolors are a valuable tool to break the age/metallicity degeneracy. our initialresults suggest that the most luminous stellar populations of bright clustergalaxies have roughly solar metallicities and about a factor of three spread inage.

astro-ph;0005234	an excess of submm sources near 4c41.17: a candidate proto-cluster at  z=3.8?	biased galaxy-formation theories predict that massive galaxies at highredshifts should act as signposts to high-density environments in the earlyuniverse, which subsequently evolve into the cores of the richest clusters seenat the present day. these regions are characterised by over-densities of younggalaxies, perhaps including a population of dusty, interaction-drivenstarbursts - the progenitors of massive cluster ellipticals. by searching forthis population at submm wavelengths we can therefore test both galaxy- andstructure-formation models. we have undertaken such a search in the field of az=3.8 radio galaxy, 4c41.17, with the scuba submm camera. our extremely deep450- and 850-micron maps reveal an order-of-magnitude over-density of luminoussubmm galaxies compared to typical fields (the likelihood of finding such anover-density in a random field is &lt;2e-3). the scuba galaxies have bolometricluminosities, &gt;10^13 l(solar), which imply star-formation rates consistent withthose required to form a massive galaxy in only a few 10^8 years. we also notethat this field exhibits an over-density of extremely red objects (eros), someof which may be associated with the submm sources, and lyman-break galaxies. wepropose that the over-densities of both submm and ero sources in this fieldrepresent young dusty, starburst galaxies forming within a proto-clustercentered on the radio galaxy at z=3.8, which is also traced by a less-obscuredpopulation of lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;0005305	the nature of the halo population of ngc 5128 resolved with nicmos on  the hubble space telescope	we present the first infrared color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for the halo of agiant elliptical galaxy. the cmd for the stars in the halo of ngc 5128(centaurus a) was constructed from hst nicmos observations of the wfpc2 chip-3field of soria et al. (1996) to a 50% completeness magnitude limit of[f160w]=23.8. this field is located at a distance of 08'50" (~9 kpc) south ofthe center of the galaxy. the luminosity function (lf) shows a markeddiscontinuity at [f160w]=20.0. this is 1-2 mag above the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb) expected for an old population (~12 gyr) at the distance modulusof ngc 5128. we propose that the majority of stars above the trgb haveintermediate ages (~2 gyr), in agreement with the wfpc2 observations of soriaet al. (1996). five stars with magnitudes brighter than the lf discontinuityare most probably due to galactic contamination. the weighted average of themean giant branch color above our 50% completeness limit is[f110w]-[f160w]=1.22+-0.08 with a dispersion of 0.19 mag. from ourartificial-star experiments we determine that the observed spread in color isreal, suggesting a real spread in metallicity. we estimate the lower and upperbounds of the stellar metallicity range by comparisons with observations ofgalactic star clusters and theoretical isochrones. assuming an old population,we find that, in the halo field of ngc 5128 we surveyed, stars havemetallicities ranging from roughly 1% of solar at the blue end of the colorspread to roughly solar at the red end, with a mean of [fe/h]=-0.76 and adispersion of 0.44 dex.

astro-ph;0107357	surface brightness fluctuations of fornax cluster galaxies: calibration  of infrared sbfs and evidence for recent star formation	we have measured k-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbfs) of 19early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster. combining our results with publisheddata, we find the absolute sbf magnitude mbar_k = (-5.84)+(3.6)*[(v-i)-1.15].the intrinsic cosmic scatter of mbar_k appears to be larger than that of i-bandsbfs. the discovery of a correlation between k-band sbfs and v-i color is a newclue into the star formation histories of early-type galaxies. this relationnaturally accounts for galaxies previously claimed to have anomalously brightk-band sbfs, namely m32 and ngc 4489. models indicate that the stellarpopulations dominating the sbf signal have a significant range in age; somescatter in metallicity may also be present. the youngest ages imply somegalaxies have very luminous giant branches, akin to those in intermediate-age(few gyr) magellanic cloud clusters. a few fornax galaxies have unusuallybright k-band sbfs, perhaps originating from a high metallicity burst of starformation in the last few gyr. the increased spread and brightening of thek-band sbfs with bluer (v-i) colors suggest that the lower mass clustergalaxies may have had more extended and more heterogeneous star formationhistories than those of the more massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0202137	the potential of differential astrometric interferometry from the high  antarctic plateau	the low infrared background and high atmospheric transparency are theprincipal advantages of antarctic plateau sites for astronomy. however, thepoor seeing (between one and three arcseconds) negates much of the sensitivityimprovements that the antarctic atmosphere offers, compared to mid-latitudesites such as mauna kea or cerro paranal. the seeing at mid-latitude sites,though smaller in amplitude, is dominated by turbulence at altitudes of 10 to20 km. over the antarctic plateau, virtually no high altitude turbulence ispresent in the winter. the mean square error for an astrometric measurementwith a dual-beam, differential astrometric interferometer in the very narrowangle regime is proportional to the integral of $h^2 c_n^2(h)$. therefore,sites at which the turbulence occurs only at low altitudes offer large gains inastrometric precision. we show that a modest interferometer at the south polecan achieve 10 $\mu$as differential astrometry 300 times faster than acomparable interferometer at a good mid-latitude site, in median conditions.science programs that would benefit from such an instrument include planetdetection and orbit determination and astrometric observation of starsmicrolensed by dark matter candidates.

astro-ph;0412478	environmental impact on the southeast limb of the cygnus loop	we analyze observations from the chandra x-ray observatory of the southeastknot of the cygnus loop supernova remnant. in this region, the blast wavepropagates through an inhomogeneous environment. extrinsic differences andsubsequent multiple projections along the line of sight rather than intrinsicshock variations, such as fluid instabilities, account for the apparentcomplexity of the images. interactions between the supernova blast wave anddensity enhancements of a large interstellar cloud can produce themorphological and spectral characteristics. most of the x-ray flux arises insuch interactions, not in the diffuse interior of the supernova remnant.additional observations at optical and radio wavelengths support this accountof the existing interstellar medium and its role in shaping the cygnus loop,and they demonstrate that the southeast knot is not a small cloud that theblast wave has engulfed. these data are consistent with rapid equilibration ofelectron and ion temperatures behind the shock front, and the current blastwave velocity v_{bw} approx 330 km/s. most of this area does not show strongevidence for non-equilibrium ionization conditions, which may be a consequenceof the high densities of the bright emission regions.

astro-ph;0506574	a planetary system as the origin of structure in fomalhaut's dust belt	the sun and &gt;15 percent of nearby stars are surrounded by dusty debris disksthat must be collisionally replenished by asteroids and comets, as the dustwould otherwise be depleted on &lt;10 myr timescales (ref. 1). theoretical studiesshow that disk structure can be modified by the gravitational influence ofplanets (ref. 2-4), but the observational evidence is incomplete, at least inpart because maps of the thermal infrared emission from disks have low linearresolution (35 au in the best case; ref. 5). optical images provide higherresolution, but the closest examples (au mic and beta pic) are edge-on (ref.6,7), preventing the direct measurement of azimuthal and radial disk structurethat is required for fitting theoretical models of planetary perturbations.here we report the detection of optical light reflected from the dust grainsorbiting fomalhaut (hd 216956). the system is inclined 24 degrees away fromedge-on, enabling the measurement of disk structure around its entirecircumference, at a linear resolution of 0.5 au. the dust is distributed in abelt 25 au wide, with a very sharp inner edge at a radial distance of 133 au,and we measure an offset of 15 au between the belt's geometric centre andfomalhaut. taken together, the sharp inner edge and offset demonstrate thepresence of planet-mass objects orbiting fomalhaut.

astro-ph;0510503	speckle statistics in adaptively corrected images	(abridged) imaging observations are generally affected by a fluctuatingbackground of speckles, a particular problem when detecting faint stellarcompanions at small angular separations. knowing the distribution of thespeckle intensities at a given location in the image plane is important forunderstanding the noise limits of companion detection. the speckle noise limitin a long-exposure image is characterized by the intensity variance and thespeckle lifetime. in this paper we address the former quantity through thedistribution function of speckle intensity. previous theoretical work haspredicted a form for this distribution function at a single location in theimage plane. we developed a fast readout mode to take short exposures ofstellar images corrected by adaptive optics at the ground-based uco/lickobservatory, with integration times of 5 ms and a time between successiveframes of 14.5 ms ($\lambda=2.2$ $\mu$m). these observations temporallyoversample and spatially nyquist sample the observed speckle patterns. we show,for various locations in the image plane, the observed distribution of speckleintensities is consistent with the predicted form. additionally, we demonstratea method by which $i_c$ and $i_s$ can be mapped over the image plane. as thequantity $i_c$ is proportional to the psf of the telescope free of randomatmospheric aberrations, this method can be used for psf calibration andreconstruction.

astro-ph;0604551	constraining the adaptive optics point-spread function in crowded  fields: measuring photometric aperture corrections	the point-spread function (psf) of an adaptive optics (ao) system is oftenpoorly known. this ignorance can lead to significant systematic errors inphotometry. since the degree of ao correction is sensitive to the observingconditions: seeing, wind speed, brightness of the wavefront reference, etc., itwould be desirable to estimate the psf from the data themselves. we havedeveloped a method to estimate the psf delivered by an ao system in the casewhere the scene consists of a crowded star field. we model the modulationtransfer function (mtf) of several key components of the imaging system. thepower spectrum of the image, even a dense star field, can then be used toconstrain our model, which in turn can be used to reconstruct the psf. we showthat the method yields reasonable fit parameters and a useful approximation tothe psf when applied to data from laser guide star (lgs) ao system at the keckobservatory. comparison of keck lgs/ao and hst/nicmos data shows thatphotometric accuracy of a few percent can be achieved for data with strehlratios as low as 4%.

astro-ph;0609332	the signature of primordial grain growth in the polarized light of the  au mic debris disk	we have used the hubble space telescope/acs coronagraph to make polarizationmaps of the au mic debris disk. the fractional linear polarization risesmonotonically from about 0.05 to 0.4 between 20 and 80 au. the polarization isperpendicular to the disk, indicating that the scattered light originates frommicron sized grains in an optically thin disk. disk models, whichsimultaneously fit the surface brightness and polarization, show that the innerdisk (&lt; 40-50 au) is depleted of micron-sized dust by a factor of more than300, which means that the disk is collision dominated. the grains have highmaximum linear polarization and strong forward scattering. spherical grainscomposed of conventional materials cannot reproduce these optical properties. amie/maxwell-garnett analysis implicates highly porous (91-94%) particles. inthe inner solar system, porous particles form in cometary dust, where thesublimation of ices leaves a "bird's nest" of refractory organic and silicatematerial. in au mic, the grain porosity may be primordial, because the dust"birth ring" lies beyond the ice sublimation point. the observed porositiesspan the range of values implied by laboratory studies of particle coagulationby ballistic cluster-cluster aggregation. to avoid compactification, the uppersize limit for the parent bodies is in the decimeter range, in agreement withtheoretical predictions based on collisional lifetime arguments. consequently,au mic may exhibit the signature of the primordial agglomeration processwhereby interstellar grains first assembled to form macroscopic objects.
