0903.3327	educating the next generation of leading scientists: turning ideas into  action	the core of scientific research is turning new ideas into reality. from theschool science fair to the search for the secrets of dark energy, high-qualityresearch consists of scientific investigation constrained within the scope of awell-defined project. large or small, generously funded or just scrapingby,scientific projects use time, money, and information to turn ideas intoplans, plans into action, and action into results. while we, as a community, domuch to educate students in the techniques of research, we do notsystematically train students in the nature and organization of scientificprojects or in the techniques of project management. we propose a two-prongedattack to address this issue in the next decade. first, to generate a broadbase of future scientists who have a basic familiarity with the ideas ofprojects, we propose that the community develop standards for the content of aproject design and management course in astronomy and astrophysics. second, totrain future scientists to assume leadership roles in new investigations inastronomy and astrophysics, we propose that the community develop standards forgraduate programs in the area of research project leadership.

0905.3743	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. ii.  test of theoretical stellar isochrones	we perform an extensive test of theoretical stellar models for main-sequencestars in ugriz, using cluster fiducial sequences obtained in the previous paperof this series. we generate a set of isochrones using the yale rotatingevolutionary code (yrec) with updated input physics, and derive magnitudes andcolors in ugriz from marcs model atmospheres. these models match cluster mainsequences over a wide range of metallicity within the errors of the adoptedcluster parameters. however, we find a large discrepancy of model colors at thelower main sequence (teff &lt; ~4500 k) for clusters at and above solarmetallicity. we also reach similar conclusions using the theoretical isochronesof girardi et al. and dotter et al., but our new models are generally in betteragreement with the data. using our theoretical isochrones, we also derivemain-sequence fitting distances and turn-off ages for five key globularclusters, and demonstrate the ability to derive these quantities fromphotometric data in the sloan digital sky survey. in particular, we exploitmultiple color indices (g - r, g - i, and g - z) in the parameter estimation,which allows us to evaluate internal systematic errors. our distance estimates,with an error of sigma(m - m) = 0.03-0.11 mag for individual clusters, areconsistent with hipparcos-based subdwarf fitting distances derived in thejohnson-cousins or stromgren photometric systems.

0906.3030	a sample of candidate radio stars in first and sdss	we conduct a search for radio stars by combining radio and optical data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm survey (first) and the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the faint limit of sdss makes possible a homogeneoussearch for radio emission from stars of low optical luminosity. we select asample of 112 candidate radio stars in the magnitude range $15&lt;i\lesssim19.1$and with radio flux $s_{20}\geq1.25$mjy, from about 7000 deg$^2$ of sky. theselection criteria are positional coincidence within $1\arcsec$, radio andoptical point source morphology, and an sdss spectrum classified as stellar.the sample contamination is estimated by random matching to be $108\pm13$,suggesting that at most a small fraction of the selected candidates are genuineradio stars. therefore, we rule out a very rare population of extremelyradio-loud stars: no more than 1.2 of every million stars in the magnituderange $15&lt;i&lt;19.1$ stars has radio flux $s_{20}\geq1.25$ mjy. we investigate theoptical and radio colors of the sample to find candidates that show the largestlikelihood of being real radio stars. the significant outliers from the stellarlocus, as well as the magnetically active stars, are the best candidates forfollow-up radio observations. we conclude that, while the present wide-arearadio surveys are not sensitive enough to provide homogeneous samples of theextremely rare radio stars, upcoming surveys which exploit the greatsensitivity of current and planned telescopes do have sufficient sensitivityand will allow the properties of this class of object to be investigated indetail.

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0909.3019	structure and kinematics of the stellar halos and thick disks of the  milky way based on calibration stars from sdss dr7	the structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of themilky way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters andkinematic quantities for 32360 calibration stars from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and its first extension, (sdss-ii), which included the sub-surveysegue: sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration. full spacemotions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpcof the sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- andouter-halo components of the galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-diskand proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. we first examine the questionof whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo inorder to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the localvolume, and whether more than two components are needed. we also address thequestion of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically andchemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. in addition, we consider thefractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observedkinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the galaxy as a function ofdistance from the plane. scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk andmetal-weak thick-disk components are determined. spatial density profiles forthe inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a jeans theoremanalysis. the full set of calibration stars (including those outside the localvolume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellarmetallicity distribution function with distance above the galactic planein-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellarpopulations.

0910.4611	light curve templates and galactic distribution of rr lyrae stars from  sloan digital sky survey stripe 82	we present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by rr lyrae starsin the sdss stripe 82 region. with the addition of sdss-ii data, a revisedselection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sampleof 483 rr lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. the mainresult from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars atgalactocentric distances 5--100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. at least 20% ofhalo stars within 30 kpc from the galactic center can be statisticallyassociated with substructure. we present strong direct evidence, based on bothrr lyrae stars and main sequence stars, that the halo stellar number densityprofile significantly steepens beyond a galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, anda larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. by using anovel method that simultaneously combines data for rr lyrae and main sequencestars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main sequence starsderived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of thesagittarius dsph tidal stream (trailing arm) towards r.a.2h-3h and dec~0 deg tobe 0.3 dex higher ([fe/h]=-1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars.together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, themonoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an earlyforming, smooth inner halo, is metal poor compared to high surface brightnessmaterial that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. the meanmetallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectableclumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as hasbeen argued from other data sets.

0910.4965	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i: optical data	we present the optical data for 195 hi-selected galaxies that fall withinboth the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the parkes equatorial survey (es).the photometric quantities have been independently recomputed for our sampleusing a new photometric pipeline optimized for large galaxies, thus correctingfor sdss's limited reliability for automatic photometry of angularly large orlow surface brightness (lsb) galaxies. we outline the magnitude of theuncertainty in the sdss catalog-level photometry and derive a quantitativemethod for correcting the over-sky subtraction in the sdss photometricpipeline. the main thrust of this paper is to present the es/sdss sample anddiscuss the methods behind the improved photometry, which will be used infuture scientific analysis. we present the overall optical properties of thesample and briefly compare to a volume-limited, optically-selected sample.compared to the optically-selected sdss sample (in the similar volume),hi-selected galaxies are bluer and more luminous (fewer dwarf ellipticals andmore star formation). however, compared to typical sdss galaxy studies, whichhave their own selection effects, our sample is bluer, fainter and lessmassive.

0910.4966	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ii: the colors of  gas-rich galaxies	we utilize color information for an hi-selected sample of 195 galaxies toexplore the star formation histories and physical conditions that produce theobserved colors. we show that the hi selection creates a significant offsettowards bluer colors that can be explained by enhanced recent bursts of starformation. there is also no obvious color bimodality, because the hi selectionrestricts the sample to bluer, actively star forming systems, diminishing theimportance of the red sequence. rising star formation rates are still requiredto explain the colors of galaxies bluer than g-r &lt; 0.3. we also demonstratethat the colors of the bluest galaxies in our sample are dominated by emissionlines and that stellar population synthesis models alone (without emissionlines) are not adequate for reproducing many of the galaxy colors. theseemission lines produce large changes in the r-i colors but leave the g-r colorlargely unchanged. in addition, we find an increase in the dispersion of galaxycolors at low masses that may be the result of a change in the star formationprocess in low-mass galaxies.

1001.4340	principal component analysis of sdss stellar spectra	we apply principal component analysis (pca) to ~100,000 stellar spectraobtained by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to avoid strongnon-linear variation of spectra with effective temperature, the sample isbinned into 0.02 mag wide intervals of the g-r color (-0.20&lt;g-r&lt;0.90, roughlycorresponding to mk spectral types a3 to k3), and pca is applied independentlyfor each bin. in each color bin, the first four eigenspectra are sufficient todescribe the observed spectra within the measurement noise. we discusscorrelations of eigencoefficients with metallicity and gravity estimated by thesloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) stellarparameters pipeline. the resulting high signal-to-noise mean spectra and theother three eigenspectra are made publicly available. these data can be used togenerate high quality spectra for an arbitrary combination of effectivetemperature, metallicity, and gravity within the parameter space probed by thesdss. the sdss stellar spectroscopic database and the pca results presentedhere offer a convenient method to classify new spectra, to search for unusualspectra, to train various spectral classification methods, and to synthesizeaccurate colors in arbitrary optical bandpasses.

1002.3701	photometric response functions of the sdss imager	the monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situmeasurements of the response function of the mosaicked ccd imager used in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). the system is outlined and the results of themeasurements, mostly during the first 6 years of the sdss, are described. wepresent the reference response functions for the five colour passbands derivedfrom these measurements, and discuss column to column variations and variationsin time, and also their effects on photometry. we also discuss the effectarising from various, slightly different response functions of the associateddetector systems that were used to give sdss photometry. we show that thecalibration procedures of sdss remove these variations reasonably well with theresulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to belarger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of thesurvey. the considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the responsefunction showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength sideduring the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error inphotometry. the aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumentalsensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. the expected colour variationis consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeatedphotometry. the colour variation is delta (u-g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and atmost delta (u-g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colours. we verified in thefinal catalogue that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag aredetected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonaleffects except for the secular u-g colour variation for stars with extremecolours.

1009.5997	the genesis of the milky way's thick disk via stellar migration	the separation of the milky way disk into a thin and thick component issupported by differences in the spatial, kinematic and metallicitydistributions of their stars. these differences have led to the view that thethick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidenceof the hierarchical growth of the milky way. we show here, using n-bodysimulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellarpopulations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internalevolution. in this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearlycircular orbits, as described by sellwood &amp; binney (2002). as stars moveoutwards they populate a thickened component. such stars found at the presenttime in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smallerradii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to theproperties observed for thick disk stars. classifying stars as members of thethin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparentseparation in the other property as observed. this scenario is supported by thesdss observation that stars in the transition region do not show anycorrelation between rotational velocity and metallicity. the good qualitativeagreement between our simulation and observations in the milky way hint thatthe thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellarmigration. nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick diskis a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thickdisks in all galaxies.

1104.2513	the case for the dual halo of the milky way	carollo et al. have recently resolved the stellar population of the milky wayhalo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and an outer halo.this result has been criticized by schoenrich et al., who claim that theretrograde signature associated with the outer halo is due to the adoption offaulty distances. we refute this claim, and demonstrate that the schoenrich etal. photometric distances are themselves flawed because they adopted anincorrect main-sequence absolute magnitude relationship from the work ofivezi\'c et al. when compared to the recommended relation from ivezi\'c et al.,which is tied to a milky way globular cluster distance scale and accounts forage and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by schoenrich et al. yieldsup to 18% shorter distances for stars near the main-sequence turnoff (to). useof the correct relationship yields agreement between the distances assigned bycarollo et al. and ivezi\'{c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within6-10%. schoenrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars (3.5 &lt;=log g &lt;= 4.0) with colors redder than the to region are likely misclassified,with which we concur. we implement a new procedure to reassign luminosityclassifications for the to stars that require it. new derivations of therotational behavior demonstrate that the retrograde signature and high velocitydispersion of the outer-halo population remains. we summarize additional linesof evidence for a dual halo, including a test of the retrograde signature basedon proper motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidencestrongly rejects the single-halo interpretation.

1104.3114	formation and evolution of the disk system of the milky way: [alpha/fe]  ratios and kinematics of the segue g-dwarf sample	we employ measurements of the [alpha/fe] ratio derived from low-resolution(r~2000) spectra of 17,277 g-type dwarfs from the segue survey to separate theminto likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. both subsamples exhibit stronggradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs,-20 to -30 km/s/dex for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km/s/dex for thethick-disk population. the rotational velocity is uncorrelated withgalactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample, and exhibits a small trendfor the thick-disk subsample. the rotational velocity decreases with distancefrom the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0km/s/kpc). thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity withmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change withmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. the eccentricity is almost independentof galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginalgradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity withdistance from the galactic plane. the shapes of the eccentricity distributionsfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from theplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.among several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radialmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of thethin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to thegas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. we emphasize that more physicallyrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry outthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

1107.3551	the two-component radio luminosity function of qsos: star formation and  agn	despite decades of study, it remains unclear whether there are distinctradio-loud and radio-quiet populations of quasi-stellar objects (qsos). earlystudies were limited by inhomogeneous qso samples, inadequate sensitivity toprobe the radio-quiet population, and degeneracy between redshift andluminosity for flux-density-limited samples. our new 6 ghz evla observationsallow us for the first time to obtain nearly complete (97%) radio detections ina volume-limited color-selected sample of 179 qsos more luminous than m_i = -23from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release seven in the narrowredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.3. the dramatic improvement in radio continuumsensitivity made possible with the new evla allows us, in 35 minutes ofintegration, to detect sources as faint as 20 microjy, or log[l_6 (w/hz)] ~21.5 at z = 0.25, well below the radio luminosity, log[l_6 (w/hz)] ~ 22.5, thatseparates star-forming galaxies from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agns)driven by accretion onto a super-massive black hole. we calculate the radioluminosity function (rlf) for these qsos using three constraints: (a) evla 6ghz observations for log[l_6 (w/hz)] &lt; 23.5, (b) nrao-vla sky survey (nvss)observations for log[l_6 (w/hz)] &gt; 23.5, and (c) the total number of sdss qsosin our volume-limited sample. we show that the rlf can be explained as asuperposition of two populations, dominated by agns at the bright end and starformation in the qso host galaxies at the faint end.

1112.0679	a description of quasar variability measured using repeated sdss and  poss imaging	we provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of theoptical continuum variability of quasars. the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)has obtained repeated imaging in five uv-to-ir photometric bands for 33,881spectroscopically confirmed quasars. about 10,000 quasars have an average of 60observations in each band obtained over a decade along stripe 82 (s82), whereasthe remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. the observedtime lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasarvariability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-framewavelengths from 1000a to 6000a. we publicly release a user-friendly catalog ofquasars from the sdss data release 7 that have been observed at least twice insdss or once in both sdss and the palomar observatory sky survey, and we use itto analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. based on a dampedrandom walk (drw) model defined by a characteristic time scale and anasymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black holemass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in s82, we canfully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-s82 quasars suchas the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. all available dataare consistent with the drw model as a viable description of the opticalcontinuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the restframe. we use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination intransient surveys such as those from ptf and lsst.

1202.6367	update on the nature of virgo overdensity	we use the eighth data release of sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr8) catalogwith its additional sky coverage of the southern galactic hemisphere, tomeasure the extent and study the nature of the virgo overdensity (vod; juric etal. 2008). the data show that the vod extends over no less than 2000 deg^2,with its true extent likely closer to 3000 deg^2. we test whether the vod canbe attributed to a tilt in the stellar halo ellipsoid with respect to the planeof the galactic disk and find that the observed symmetry of the north-southgalactic hemisphere star counts excludes this possibility. we argue that thevirgo overdensity, in spite of its wide area and cloud-like appearance, isstill best explained by a minor merger. its appearance and position isqualitatively similar to a near perigalacticon merger event and, assuming thatthe vod and the virgo stellar stream share the same progenitor, consistent withthe vss orbit determined by casetti-dinescu et al.

1209.1099	disclosing the radio loudness distribution dichotomy in quasars: an  unbiased monte carlo approach applied to the sdss-first quasar sample	we investigate the dichotomy in the radio loudness distribution of quasars bymodelling their radio emission and various selection effects using a montecarlo approach. the existence of two physically distinct quasar populations,the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, is controversial and over the lastdecade a bimodal distribution of radio loudness of quasars has been bothaffirmed and disputed. we model the quasar radio luminosity distribution withsimple unimodal and bimodal distribution functions. the resulting simulatedsamples are compared to a fiducial sample of 8,300 quasars drawn from the sdssdr7 quasar catalog and combined with radio observations from the first survey.our results indicate that the sdss-first sample is best described by a radioloudness distribution which consists of two components, with 12+/-1 % ofsources in the radio-loud component. on the other hand, the evidence for alocal minimum in the loudness distribution (bimodality) is not strong and wefind that previous claims for its existence were probably affected by theincompleteness of the first survey close to its faint limit. we alsoinvestigate the redshift and luminosity dependence of the radio loudnessdistribution and find tentative evidence that at high redshift radio-loudquasars were rarer, on average "louder", and exhibited a smaller range in radioloudness. in agreement with other recent work, we conclude that the sdss-firstsample strongly suggests that the radio loudness distribution of quasars is nota universal function, and that more complex models than presented here areneeded to fully explain available observations.

1209.2708	constraints on the shape of the milky way dark matter halo from jeans  equations applied to sdss data	we search for evidence of dark matter in the milky way by utilizing thestellar number density distribution and kinematics measured by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) to heliocentric distances exceeding ~10 kpc. weemploy the cylindrically symmetric form of jeans equations and focus on themorphology of the resulting acceleration maps, rather than the normalization ofthe total mass as done in previous, mostly local, studies. jeans equations arefirst applied to a mock catalog based on a cosmologically derived n-body + sphsimulation, and the known acceleration (gradient of gravitational potential) issuccessfully recovered. the same simulation is also used to quantify the impactof dark matter on the total acceleration. we use galfast, a code designed toquantitatively reproduce sdss measurements and selection effects, to generate asynthetic stellar catalog. we apply jeans equations to this catalog and producetwo-dimensional maps of stellar acceleration. these maps reveal that in anewtonian framework, the implied gravitational potential cannot be explained byvisible matter alone. the acceleration experienced by stars at galactocentricdistances of ~20 kpc is three times larger than what can be explained by purelyvisible matter. the application of an analytic method for estimating the darkmatter halo axis ratio to sdss data implies an oblate halo with q_dm = 0.47 +/-0.14 within the same distance range. these techniques can be used to map thedark matter halo to much larger distances from the galactic center usingupcoming deep optical surveys, such as lsst.

1209.3770	characterizing the optical variability of bright blazars:  variability-based selection of fermi agn	we investigate the use of optical photometric variability to select andidentify blazars in large-scale time-domain surveys, in part to aid in theidentification of blazar counterparts to the ~30% of gamma-ray sources in thefermi 2fgl catalog still lacking reliable associations. using data from theoptical linear asteroid survey, we characterize the optical variability ofblazars by fitting a damped random walk model to individual light curves withtwo main model parameters, the characteristic timescales of variability (tau),and driving amplitudes on short timescales (sigma). imposing cuts on minimumtau and sigma allows for blazar selection with high efficiency e andcompleteness c. to test the efficacy of this approach, we apply this method tooptically variable linear objects that fall within the several-arcminute errorellipses of gamma-ray sources in the fermi 2fgl catalog. despite the extremestellar contamination at the shallow depth of the linear survey, we are able torecover previously-associated optical counterparts to fermi agn with e &gt; 88%and c = 88% in fermi 95% confidence error ellipses having semimajor axis r &lt;8'. we find that the suggested radio counterpart to fermi source 2fglj1649.6+5238 has optical variability consistent with other gamma-ray blazars,and is likely to be the gamma-ray source. our results suggest that thevariability of the non-thermal jet emission in blazars is stochastic in nature,with unique variability properties due to the effects of relativistic beaming.after correcting for beaming, we estimate that the characteristic timescale ofblazar variability is ~3 years in the rest-frame of the jet, in contrast withthe ~320 day disk flux timescale observed in quasars. the variability-basedselection method presented will be useful for blazar identification intime-domain optical surveys, and is also a probe of jet physics.

1303.3448	agn and starburst radio emission from optically selected qsos	we used the 1.4 ghz nvss to study radio sources in two color-selected qsosamples: a volume-limited sample of 1313 qsos defined by m_i &lt; -23 in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 and a magnitude-limited sample of 2471 qsos withm_r &lt; 18.5 and 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. about 10% were detected above the 2.4 mjy nvsscatalog limit and are powered primarily by agns. the space density of thelow-redshift qsos evolves as rho proportional to (1+z)^6. in both redshiftranges the flux-density distributions and luminosity functions of qsos strongerthan 2.4 mjy are power laws, with no features to suggest more than one kind ofradio source. extrapolating the power laws to lower luminosities predicts theremaining qsos should be extremely radio quiet, but they are not. most weredetected statistically on the nvss images with median peak flux densitiess_p(mjy/beam) ~ 0.3 and 0.05 in the low- and high-redshift samples,corresponding to 1.4 ghz spectral luminosities log[l(w/hz)] ~ 22.7$ and 24.1,respectively. we suggest that the faint radio sources are powered by starformation at rates ~20 m_sun per year in the moderate luminosity (median m_i ~-23.4) low-redshift qsos and ~500 m_sun per year in the very luminous (m_i} ~-27.5) high-redshift qsos. such luminous starbursts [ log(l / l_sun) ~ 11.2 and12.6, respectively] are consistent with "quasar mode" accretion in which coldgas flows fuel both agn and starburst.

0801.0312	the environment of galaxies at low redshift	we compare environmental effects in two analogous samples of galaxies, onefrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the other from a semi-analyticmodel (sam) based on the millennium simulation (ms), to test to what extentcurrent sams of galaxy formation are reproducing environmental effects. weestimate the large-scale environment of each galaxy using a bayesian densityestimator based on distances to all ten nearest neighbors and comparebroad-band photometric properties of the two samples as a function ofenvironment. the feedbacks implemented in the semi-analytic model produce aqualitatively correct galaxy population with similar environmental dependenceas that seen in sdss galaxies. in detail, however, the colors of ms galaxiesexhibit an exaggerated dependence on environment: the field contains too manyblue galaxies while clusters contain too many red galaxies, compared to thesdss sample. we also find that the ms contains a population of highlyclustered, relatively faint red galaxies with velocity dispersions comparableto their hubble flow. such high-density galaxies, if they exist, would beoverlooked in any low-redshift survey since their membership to a clustercannot be determined due to the "fingers of god" effect.

1312.1916	all weather calibration of wide field optical and nir surveys	the science goals for ground-based large-area surveys, such as the darkenergy survey, pan-starrs, and the large synoptic survey telescope, requirecalibration of broadband photometry that is stable in time and uniform over thesky to precisions of a per cent or better. this performance will need to beachieved with data taken over the course of many years, and often in less thanideal conditions. this paper describes a strategy to achieve precise internalcalibration of imaging survey data taken in less than photometric conditions,and reports results of an observational study of the techniques needed toimplement this strategy. we find that images of celestial fields used in thiscase study with stellar densities of order one per arcmin-squared and takenthrough cloudless skies can be calibrated with relative precision of 0.5 percent (reproducibility). we report measurements of spatial structure functionsof cloud absorption observed over a range of atmospheric conditions, and findit possible to achieve photometric measurements that are reproducible to 1 percent in images that were taken through cloud layers that transmit as little as25 per cent of the incident optical flux (1.5 magnitudes of extinction). wefind, however, that photometric precision below 1 per cent is impeded by thethinnest detectable cloud layers. we comment on implications of these resultsfor the observing strategies of future surveys.

1312.5380	agn torus properties with wise	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) has scanned the entire skywith unprecedented sensitivity in four infrared bands, at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22micron. the wise point source catalog contains more than 560 million objects,among them hundreds of thousands of galaxies with active nuclei (agn). whiletype 1 agn, owing to their bright and unobscured nature, are easy to detect andconstitute a rather complete and unbiased sample, their type 2 counterparts,postulated by agn unification, are not as straightforward to identify. matchingthe wise catalog with known qsos in the sloan digital sky survey we confirmprevious identification of the type 1 locus in the wise color space. using avery large database of the popular clumpy torus models, we find the colors ofthe putative type 2 counterparts, and also, for the first time, predict theirnumber vs. flux relation that can be expected to be observed in any given wisecolor range. this will allow us to put statistically very significantconstraints on the torus parameters. our results are a successful test of theagn unification scheme.

1405.7966	the meaning of wise colours - i. the galaxy and its satellites	through matches with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) catalogue weidentify the location of various families of astronomical objects in wisecolour space. we identify reliable indicators that separate galactic/local fromextragalactic sources and concentrate here on the objects in our galaxy and itsclosest satellites. we develop colour and magnitude criteria that are basedonly on wise data to select asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars withcircumstellar dust shells, and separate them into o-rich and c-rich classes.with these criteria we produce an all-sky map for the count ratio of the twopopulations. the map reveals differences between the galactic disc, themagellanic clouds and the sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy, as well as a radialgradient in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) disc. we find that the c:o numberratio for dusty agb stars increases with distance from the lmc centre abouttwice as fast as measured for near-ir selected samples of early agb stars.detailed radiative transfer models show that wise colours are well explained bythe emission of centrally heated dusty shells where the dust has standardproperties of interstellar medium (ism) grains. the segregation of differentclasses of objects in wise colour space arises from differences in propertiesof the dust shells: those around young stellar objects have uniform densitydistributions while in evolved stars they have steep radial profiles.

1408.5388	the milky way tomography with sdss. v. mapping the dark matter halo	we present robust constraints from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) on theshape and distribution of the dark matter halo within the milky way (mw). usingthe number density distribution and kinematics of sdss halo stars, we probe thedark matter distribution to heliocentric distances exceeding 10 kpc andgalactocentric distances exceeding 20 kpc. our analysis utilizes jeansequations to generate two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume;this approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived n-body+sphsimulation of a mw-like galaxy. we show that the known accelerations (gradientsof the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such arealistic system. leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived bybovy &amp; rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the sdssobservations cannot be explained, assuming newtonian gravity, by visible matteralone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distancesof 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed topurely visible matter. we also show that the sdss data provide a strongconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. withingalactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is welldescribed as an oblate halo with axis ratio qdm=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds toan axis ratio qdm=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution. becauseof our precise two-dimensional measurements of the acceleration of the halostars, we can reject several mond models as an explanation of the observedbehavior.

1502.01344	periodograms for multiband astronomical time series	this paper introduces the multiband periodogram, a general extension of thewell-known lomb-scargle approach for detecting periodic signals in time-domaindata. in addition to advantages of the lomb-scargle method such as treatment ofnon-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogramsignificantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband lightcurves (e.g., pan-starrs, des and lsst). the light curves in each band aremodeled as arbitrary truncated fourier series, with the period and phase sharedacross all bands. the key aspect is the use of tikhonov regularization whichdrives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to allbands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the basemodel and typically require lower-order fourier series. this decrease in theeffective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. we usesimulated light curves and randomly subsampled sdss stripe 82 data todemonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from theliterature, and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine thecorrect period in the majority of lsst's bright rr lyrae stars with as littleas six months of lsst data. a python implementation of this method, along withcode to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on github.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

0804.3850	the milky way tomography with sdss: ii. stellar metallicity	using effective temperature and metallicity derived from sdss spectra for~60,000 f and g type main sequence stars (0.2&lt;g-r&lt;0.6), we develop polynomialmodels for estimating these parameters from the sdss u-g and g-r colors. weapply this method to sdss photometric data for about 2 million f/g stars andmeasure the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limitedsample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. the metallicitydistribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a spatiallyvarying number ratio, that correspond to disk and halo. the two components alsopossess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. the metallicity of thehalo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicitysmoothly decreases with distance from the galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to-0.8 beyond several kpc. the absence of a correlation between metallicity andkinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional decompositionin terms of thin and thick disks. we detect coherent substructures in thekinematics--metallicity space, such as the monoceros stream, which rotatesfaster than the lsr, and has a median metallicity of [fe/h]=-0.96, with an rmsscatter of only ~0.15 dex. we extrapolate our results to the performanceexpected from the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) and estimate that thelsst will obtain metallicity measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, withproper motion measurements accurate to ~0.2 mas/yr, for about 200 million f/gdwarf stars within a distance limit of ~100 kpc (g&lt;23.5).

0806.0511	agn dusty tori: i. handling of clumpy media	according to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (agn), the centralengine is surrounded by dusty, optically thick clouds in a toroidal structure.we have recently developed a formalism that for the first time takes properaccount of the clumpy nature of the agn torus. we now provide a detailed reportof our findings in a two-paper series. here we present our general formalismfor radiative transfer in clumpy media and construct its building blocks forthe agn problem -- the source functions of individual dusty clouds heated bythe agn radiation field. we show that a fundamental difference from smoothdensity distributions is that in a clumpy medium, a large range of dusttemperatures coexist at the same distance from the radiation central source.this distinct property explains the low dust temperatures found close to thenucleus of ngc1068 in 10 \mic interferometric observations. we find thatirrespective of the overall geometry, a clumpy dust distribution shows onlymoderate variation in its spectral energy distribution, and the 10\mic\absorption feature is never deep. furthermore, the x-ray attenuating columndensity is widely scattered around the column density that characterizes the iremission. all of these properties are characteristic of agn observations. theassembly of clouds into agn tori and comparison with observations is presentedin the companion paper.

0806.0512	agn dusty tori: ii. observational implications of clumpiness	from extensive radiative transfer calculations we find that clumpy torusmodels with \no \about 5--15 dusty clouds along radial equatorial rayssuccessfully explain agn infrared observations. the dust has standard galacticcomposition, with individual cloud optical depth \tv \about 30--100 at visual.the models naturally explain the observed behavior of the 10\mic silicatefeature, in particular the lack of deep absorption features in agn of any type.the weak 10\mic emission feature tentatively detected in type 2 qso can bereproduced if in these sources \no drops to \about 2 or \tv exceeds \about 100.the clouds angular distribution must have a soft-edge, e.g., gaussian profile,the radial distribution should decrease as $1/r$ or $1/r^2$. compact tori canexplain all observations, in agreement with the recent interferometric evidencethat the ratio of the torus outer to inner radius is perhaps as small as \about5--10. clumpy torus models can produce nearly isotropic ir emission togetherwith highly anisotropic obscuration, as required by observations. in contrastwith strict variants of unification schemes where the viewing-angle uniquelydetermines the classification of an agn into type 1 or 2, clumpiness impliesthat it is only a probabilistic effect; a source can display type 1 propertieseven from directions close to the equatorial plane. the fraction of obscuredsources depends not only on the torus angular thickness but also on the cloudnumber \no. the observed decrease of this fraction at increasing luminosity canbe explained with a decrease of either torus angular thickness or cloud number,but only the latter option explains also the possible emergence of a 10\micemission feature in qso2.

0807.3762	the size distributions of asteroid families in the sdss moving object  catalog 4	asteroid families, traditionally defined as clusters of objects in orbitalparameter space, often have distinctive optical colors. we show that theseparation of family members from background interlopers can be improved withthe aid of sdss colors as a qualifier for family membership. based on an~88,000 object subset of the sloan digital sky survey moving object catalog 4with available proper orbital elements, we define 37 statistically robustasteroid families with at least 100 members using a simple gaussiandistribution model in both orbital and color space. the interloper rejectionrate based on colors is typically ~10% for a given orbital family definition,with four families that can be reliably isolated only with the aid of colors.about 50% of all objects in this data set belong to families, and this fractionvaries from about 35% for objects brighter than an h magnitude of 13 and risesto 60% for objects fainter than this. the fraction of c-type objects infamilies decreases with increasing h magnitude for h &gt; 13, while the fractionof s-type objects above this limit remains effectively constant. this suggeststhat s-type objects require a shorter timescale for equilibrating thebackground and family size distributions via collisional processing. the sizedistributions for 15 families display a well-defined change of slope and can bemodeled as a "broken" double power-law. such "broken" size distributions aretwice as likely for s-type familes than for c-type families, and are dominatedby dynamically old families. the remaining families with size distributionsthat can be modeled as a single power law are dominated by young families. whensize distribution requires a double power-law model, the two slopes arecorrelated and are steeper for s-type families.

0807.3951	the distribution of basaltic asteroids in the main belt	we present the observational results of a survey designed to target anddetect asteroids whose colors are similar to those of vesta family members andthus may be considered as candidates for having a basaltic composition. fiftybasaltic candidates were selected with orbital elements that lie outside of thevesta dynamical family. optical and near-infrared spectra were used to assign ataxonomic type to 11 of the 50 candidates. ten of these were spectroscopicallyconfirmed as v-type asteroids, suggesting that most of the candidates arebasaltic and can be used to constrain the distribution of basaltic material inthe main belt.  using our catalog of v-type candidates and the success rate of the survey, wecalculate unbiased size-frequency and semi-major axis distributions of v-typeasteroids. these distributions, in addition to an estimate for the total massof basaltic material, suggest that vesta was the predominant contributor to thebasaltic asteroid inventory of the main belt, however scattered planetesimalsfrom the inner solar system (a &lt; 2.0 au) and other partially/fullydifferentiated bodies likely contributed to this inventory. in particular, weinfer the presence of basaltic fragments in the vicinity of asteroid 15eunomia, which may be derived from a differentiated parent body in the middlemain belt (2.5 &lt; a &lt; 2.8). we find no asteroidal evidence for a large number ofpreviously undiscovered basaltic asteroids, which agrees with previous theoriessuggesting that basaltic fragments from the ~100 differentiated parent bodiesrepresented in meteorite collections have been "battered to bits" [burbine,t.h., meibom, a., binzel, r.p., 1996. mantle material in the main belt:battered to bits? met. &amp; planet. sci. 31, 607].

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0008401	discovery of a close pair of z = 4.25 quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of a pair of z = 4.25 quasars with a separation of 33arcseconds. the brighter of the two objects was identified as a high-redshiftquasar candidate from sloan digital sky survey multicolor imaging data, and theredshift was measured from a spectrum obtained with the hobby-eberly telescope.the slit orientation of this observation {\it by chance} included anotherquasar, approximately one magnitude fainter and having the same redshift as thetarget. this is the third serendipitous discovery of a z &gt; 4 quasar. thedifferences in the relative strengths and profiles of the emission linessuggest that this is a quasar pair and not a gravitational lens. the twoobjects are likely to be physically associated; the projected physicalseparation is approximately 210 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc and the redshifts areidentical to $\approx$ 0.01, implying a radial physical separation of 950$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc or less. the existence of this pair is strong circumstantialevidence that $z \sim 4$ quasars are clustered.

astro-ph;0106096	dusty winds: i. self-similar solutions	we address the dusty wind problem, from the point where dust formation hasbeen completed and outward. given grain properties, both radiative transfer andhydrodynamics components of the problem are fully defined by four additionalinput parameters. the wind radiative emission and the shape of its velocityprofile are both independent of the actual magnitude of the velocity and aredetermined by just three dimensionless free parameters. of the three, only oneis always significant---for most of phase space the solution is described by aset of similarity functions of a single independent variable, which can bechosen as the overall optical depth at visual \tv. the self-similarity impliesgeneral scaling relations among mass loss rate (\mdot), luminosity ($l$) andterminal velocity (\vf). systems with different \mdot, $l$ and \vf but the samecombination $\mdot/l^{3/4}$ necessarily have also the same $\mdot\vf/l$.  ... eliminating \tv produces $\vf^3 = a \mdot(1 + b \mdot^{4/3}/l)^{-1.5}$,where $a$ and $b$ are coefficients that contain the only dependence of thisuniversal correlation on chemical composition. at a given $l$, the maximalvelocity of a dusty wind is $v\sub{max} \propto l^{1/4}$ attained at $\mdot\propto l^{3/4}$, with proportionality coefficients derived from $a$ and $b$.

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0112482	the cut &amp; enhance method : selecting clusters of galaxies from the sdss  commissioning data	we describe an automated method, the cut &amp; enhance method (ce) for detectingclusters of galaxies in multi-color optical imaging surveys. this method usessimple color cuts, combined with a density enhancement algorithm, to up-weightpairs of galaxies that are close in both angular separation and color. themethod is semi-parametric since it uses minimal assumptions about clusterproperties in order to minimize possible biases. no assumptions are made aboutthe shape of clusters, their radial profile or their luminosity function. themethod is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters ofgalaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. we determine the selectionfunction of the ce method via extensive monte carlo simulations which use boththe real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background ofgalaxies. we use position shuffled and color shuffled data to perform the falsepositive test. we have also visually checked all the clusters detected by thece method. we apply the ce method to the 350 deg^2 of the sdss (sloan digitalsky survey) commissioning data and construct a sdss ce galaxy cluster catalogwith an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster. the ce method iscompared with other cluster selection methods used on sdss data such as thematched filter (postman et al. 1996, kim et al. 2001), maxbcg technique (anniset al. 2001) and voronoi tessellation (kim et al. 2001). the ce method can beadopted for cluster selection in any multi-color imaging surveys.

astro-ph;0202251	spectroscopic target selection in the sloan digital sky survey: the  quasar sample	we describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for opticalspectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey. quasar candidates are selectedvia their non-stellar colors in "ugriz" broad-band photometry, and by matchingunresolved sources to the first radio catalogs. the automated algorithm issensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than z=5.8. extended sources arealso targeted as low-redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate theevolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) at the faint end of the luminosityfunction. nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540quasars in 446 square degrees). the overall completeness, estimated fromsimulated quasars, is expected to be over 90%, whereas the overall efficiency(quasars:quasar candidates) is better than 65%. the selection algorithm targetsultraviolet excess quasars to i^*=19.1 and higher-redshift (z&gt;3) quasars toi^*=20.2, yielding approximately 18 candidates per square degree. in additionto selecting ``normal'' quasars, the design of the algorithm makes it sensitiveto atypical agn such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddenedquasars.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

0808.2282	candidate disk wide binaries in the sloan digital sky survey	using sdss data release 6, we construct two independent samples of candidatestellar wide binaries selected as i) pairs of unresolved sources with angularseparation in the range 3'' - 16'', ii) common proper motion pairs with 5'' -30'' angular separation, and make them publicly available. these samples aredominated by disk stars, and we use them to constrain the shape of themain-sequence photometric parallax relation m_r(r-i) and to study theproperties of wide binary systems. we estimate m_r(r-i) by searching for arelation that minimizes the difference between distance moduli of primary andsecondary components of wide binary candidates. we model m_r(r-i) by a fourthdegree polynomial and determine the coefficients using markov chain monte carlofitting, independently for each sample. aided by the derived photometricparallax relation, we construct a series of high-quality catalogs of candidatemain-sequence binary stars. using these catalogs, we study the distribution ofsemi-major axes of wide binaries, a, in the 2,000 &lt; a &lt; 47,000 au range. wefind the observations to be well described by the opik distribution, f(a)~1/a,for a&lt;a_{break}, where a_{break} increases roughly linearly with the height zabove the galactic plane (a_{break}~12,300 z[kpc]^0.7 au). the number of widebinary systems with 100 au &lt; a &lt; a_{break}, as a fraction of the total numberof stars, decreases from 0.9% at z=0.5 kpc to 0.5% at z=3 kpc. the probabilityfor a star to be in a wide binary system is independent of its color. giventhis color, the companions of red components seem to be drawn randomly from thestellar luminosity function, while blue components have a larger blue-to-redcompanion ratio than expected from luminosity function.

astro-ph;0212087	average spectra of massive galaxies in the sdss	we combine sloan digital sky survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red,bulge-dominated galaxies to get high s/n average spectra in the rest-frameoptical and ultraviolet (2600a to 7000a). the average spectra of these massive,quiescent galaxies are early-type with weak emission lines and with absorptionlines indicating an apparent excess of alpha elements over solar abundanceratios. we make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity,environment and redshift. the average spectra are remarkable in theirsimilarity. what variations do exist in the average spectra as a function ofluminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family inspectrum space. we present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of thevariation. we measure the properties of the variation with a modified versionof the lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar populationsyntheses. the variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundancedifferences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the dataconsiderably exceeds the current state of the models.

astro-ph;0301005	the sloan digital sky survey: the cosmic spectrum and star-formation  history	we present a determination of the `cosmic optical spectrum' of the universe,i.e. the ensemble emission from galaxies, as determined from the red-selectedsloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample and compare with previous resultsof the blue-selected 2df galaxy redshift survey. broadly we find good agreementin both the spectrum and the derived star-formation histories. if we use apower-law star-formation history model where star-formation rate $\propto(1+z)^\beta$ out to z=1, then we find that $\beta$ of 2 to 3 is still the mostlikely model and there is no evidence for current surveys missing large amountsof star formation at high redshift. in particular `fossil cosmology' of thelocal universe gives measures of star-formation history which are consistentwith direct observations at high redshift. using the photometry of sdss we areable to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e.$ w \aa$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$) at 2--5\aa resolution and find good agreement with publishedbroad-band luminosity densities. for a salpeter imf the best fit stellarmass/light ratio is 3.7--7.5 $\msun/\lsun$ in the r-band (corresponding to$\omstars h = 0.0025$--0.0055) and from both the stellar emission history andthe h$\alpha$ luminosity density independently we find a cosmologicalstar-formation rate of 0.03--0.04 h $\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$ today.

astro-ph;0301029	a low latitude halo stream around the milky way	we present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the milky way,extending at least from l = 180 deg to l = 227 deg with turnoff magnitude $g\sim 19.5$; the ring could encircle the galaxy. we infer that the low galacticlatitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of r = 18 +/- 2 kpc fromthe galactic center above the galactic plane, and has r = 20 +/- 2 kpc in theregion sampled below the galactic plane. the evidence includes five hundredsdss spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30 degrees of the plane.the velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found tobe 27 km/s at (l,b) = (198, -27), 22 km/s at (l,b) = (225, 28), 30 km/s at(l,b) = (188, 24), and 30 km/s at (l,b) = (182, 27) degrees. the structurerotates in the same prograde direction as the galactic disk stars, but with acircular velocity of 110+/-25 km/s. the narrow measured velocity dispersion isinconsistent with power law spheroid or thick disk populations. we compare thevelocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars inthe sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocitydispersion of 20 km/s at (l, b) = (165, -55) deg. we estimate a preliminarymetallicity from the ca ii (k) line and color of the turnoff stars of [fe/h] =-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistentwith that of the spheroid population. we interpret our measurements as evidencefor a tidally disrupted satellite of $2 \times 10^7$ to $5 \times 10^8 \rmm_\odot$ which rings the galaxy.

astro-ph;0309040	ir emission from agns	unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (agn) require an obscuring dustytorus around the central source, giving rise to type 1 line spectrum forpole-on viewing and type 2 characteristics in edge-on sources. infraredradiation at its different wavelengths is the best probe of the dustdistribution, whether the torus orientation is edge-on or pole-on. the observedir is in broad agreement with the unified scheme but serious problems remainedin all early modeling efforts. in spite of a general awareness that the dustmust be concentrated in clouds, clumpiness remained the one major ingredientmissing in those radiative transfer studies because of the inherentdifficulties it presents. we have recently developed the formalism to handledust clumpiness and our results indicate that its inclusion may resolve thedifficulties encountered by the previous theoretical efforts. we show thatthese problems find a natural explanation if the dust is contained in \about\5--10 clouds along radial rays through the torus. the spectral energydistributions (sed) of both type 1 and type 2 sources are properly reproducedfrom different viewpoints of the same object if the optical depth of each cloudis \ga 40 at visual wavelengths and the clouds' mean free path increasesroughly in proportion to radial distance.

astro-ph;0406248	candidate type ii quasars from the sloan digital sky survey: ii. from  radio to x-rays	type ii quasars are luminous agns whose central engines and broad-lineregions are obscured by intervening material; such objects only recently havebeen discovered in appreciable numbers. we study the multiwavelength propertiesof 291 type ii agn candidates (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) selected based on their opticalemission line properties from the spectroscopic database of the sloan digitalsky survey. this sample includes about 150 objects luminous enough to beclassified as type ii quasars. we matched the sample to the first (20 cm), iras(12-100 micron), 2mass (jhk_s) and rass (0.1-2.4 kev) surveys. roughly 10% ofoptically selected type ii agn candidates are radio-loud, comparable to the agnpopulation as a whole. about 40 objects are detected by iras at 60 micronand/or 100 micron, and the inferred mid/far-ir luminosities lie in the range nul_nu=10^45-3x10^46 erg/sec. average ir-to-[oiii]5007 ratios of objects in oursample are consistent with those of other agns. objects from our sample are tentimes less likely to have soft x-ray counterparts in rass than type i agns withthe same redshifts and [oiii]5007 luminosities. the few type ii agn candidatesfrom our sample that are detected by rass have harder x-ray spectra than thoseof type i agns. the multiwavelength properties of the type ii agn candidatesfrom our sample are consistent with their interpretation as powerful obscuredagns.

astro-ph;0407061	distributions of galaxy spectral types in the sloan digital sky survey	we perform an objective classification of 170,000 galaxy spectra in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) using the karhunen-lo\`eve (kl) transform. with aboutone-sixth of the total set of galaxy spectra which will be obtained by thesurvey, we are able to carry out the most extensive analysis of its kind todate. the formalism proposed by connolly and szalay is adopted to correct forgappy regions in the spectra, and to derive eigenspectra and eigencoefficients.  from this analysis, we show that this gap-correction formalism leads to aconverging set of eigenspectra and kl-repaired spectra. furthermore, kleigenspectra of galaxies are found to be convergent not only as a function ofiteration, but also as a function of the number of randomly selected galaxyspectra used in the analysis. from these data a set of ten eigenspectra ofgalaxy spectra are constructed, with rest-wavelength coverage 3450-8350angstrom. the eigencoefficients describing these galaxies naturally place thespectra into several classes defined by the plane formed by the first threeeigencoefficients of each spectrum. spectral types, corresponding to differenthubble-types and galaxies with extreme emission lines, are identified for the170,000 spectra and are shown to be complementary to existing spectralclassifications. from a non-parametric classification technique, we find thatthe population of galaxies can be divided into three classes which correspondto early late- through to intermediate late-types galaxies.

astro-ph;0505334	the uv, optical, and ir properties of sdss sources detected by galex	we discuss the uv, optical, and ir properties of the sdss sources detected bygalex as part of its all-sky imaging survey early release observations.virtually all of the galex sources in the overlap region are detected by sdss.galex sources represent ~2.5% of all sdss sources within these fields and abouthalf are optically unresolved. most unresolved galex/sdss sources are brightblue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the galexnear-uv band. the remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,white dwarfs, and white dwarf/m dwarf pairs, and these dominate the opticallyunresolved sources detected in both galex bands.  almost all the resolved sdss sources detected by galex are fainter than thesdss 'main' spectroscopic limit. these sources have colors consistent withthose of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r&lt;2.2), and most are detected in both galexbands. measurements of their uv colors allow much more accurate and robustestimates of star-formation history than are possible using only sdss data.indeed, galaxies with the most recent (&lt;20 myr) star formation can be robustlyselected from the galex data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-uvthan in the near-uv band. however, older starburst galaxies have uv colorssimilar to agn, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of galexfluxes alone.  with the aid of 2mass data, we construct and discuss median 10 banduv-optical-ir spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot whitedwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. we point outthe high degree of correlation between the uv color and the contribution of theuv flux to the uv-optical-ir flux of galaxies detected by galex.

astro-ph;0611453	the radio-loud fraction of quasars is a strong function of redshift and  optical luminosity	using a sample of optically-selected quasars from the sloan digital skysurvey, we have determined the radio-loud fraction (rlf) of quasars as afunction of redshift and optical luminosity. the sample contains more than30,000 objects and spans a redshift range of 0&lt;z&lt;5 and a luminosity range of-30&lt;m_i&lt;-22. we use both the radio-to-optical flux ratio (r parameter) andradio luminosity to define radio-loud quasars. after breaking the correlationbetween redshift and luminosity due to the flux-limited nature of the sample,we find that the rlf of quasars decreases with increasing redshift anddecreasing luminosity. the relation can be described in the form oflog(rlf/(1-rlf)) = b_0 + b_z log(1+z) + b_m (m_{2500}+26), where m_{2500} isthe absolute magnitude at rest-frame 2500a, and b_z, b_m&lt;0. when using r&gt;10 todefine radio-loud quasars, we find that b_0=-0.132+/-0.116, b_z=-2.052+/-0.261,and b_m=-0.183+/-0.025. the rlf at z=0.5 declines from 24.3% to 5.6% asluminosity decreases from m_{2500}=-26 to m_{2500}=-22, and the rlf atm_{2500}=-26 declines from 24.3% to 4.1% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3,suggesting that the rlf is a strong function of both redshift and luminosity.we also examine the impact of flux-related selection effects on the rlfdetermination using a series of tests, and find that the dependence of the rlfon redshift and luminosity is highly likely to be physical, and the selectioneffects we considered are not responsible for the dependence.

astro-ph;9512154	infrared imaging of late-type stars	infrared imaging properties of dusty winds around late-type stars areinvestigated in detail, employing a self-consistent model that couples theequations of motion and radiative transfer. because of general scalingproperties, the angular profiles of surface brightness are self-similar. in anygiven star, the profile shape is determined essentially by overall opticaldepth at each wavelength and it is self-similarly scaled by the size of thedust condensation zone. we find that the mid-ir is the best wavelength range tomeasure directly the angular size of this zone, and from {\it iras} data weidentify the 15 best candidates for such future observations. we also show thatthe visibility function at short wavelengths ($\la$ 2 \mic) directly determinesthe scattering optical depth, and produce theoretical visibility curves forvarious characteristic wavelengths and the entire parameter range relevant tolate-type stars. the infrared emission should display time variability becauseof cyclical changes in overall optical depth, reflecting luminosity-inducedmovement of the dust condensation point. calculations of the wavelengthdependence of photometric amplitudes and time variability of envelope sizes arein agreement with observations; envelopes are bigger and bluer at maximumlight.

astro-ph;9612164	self-similarity and scaling behavior of ir emission from radiatively  heated dust: i. theory	dust infrared emission possesses scaling properties. overall luminosity isnever an input parameter of the radiative transfer problem, spectral shape isthe only relevant property of the heating radiation when the inner boundary ofthe dusty region is controlled by dust sublimation. similarly, the absolutescales of densities and distances are irrelevant; the geometry enters onlythrough angles, relative thicknesses and aspect ratios, and the actualmagnitudes of densities and distances enter only through one independentparameter, the overall optical depth. dust properties enter only throughdimensionless, normalized distributions that describe the spatial variation ofdensity and the wavelength dependence of scattering and absorptionefficiencies. scaling enables a systematic approach to modeling andclassification of ir spectra. we develop a new, fully scale-free method forsolving radiative transfer, present exact numerical results, and deriveapproximate analytical solutions for spherical geometry, covering the entirerange of parameter space relevant to observations. scaling implies tightcorrelations among the seds of various members of the same class of sourcessuch as young stellar objects, late-type stars, etc. in particular, all membersof the same class occupy common, well defined regions in color-color diagrams.the observational data corroborate the existence of these correlations.

(1996). such a possibilityappears to be supported by numerous recent observations.

0706.0004	the accretion origin of the milky way's stellar halo	we have used data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 toexplore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the milkyway using about 4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off stars. we fitoblate and triaxial broken power-law models to the data, and found a `best-fit'oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5&lt;c/a&lt;0.8, and halo stellar masses betweengalactocentric radii of 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+/-1.2)x10^8 m_sun. the densityprofile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that thepower law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. yet,we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to thedistribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal ofspatial substructure. we quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxialmodel using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales &gt;~100pc,after accounting for the (known) contribution of poisson uncertainties. thefractional rms deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,parameterized halo model is &gt;~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highlystructured. we compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellarhalos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmologicalcontext by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. while themasses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellarhalos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure inthe milky way's halo match well the properties of a `typical' stellar halobuilt exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. ourresults therefore point towards a picture in which an important fraction of themilky way's stellar halo has been accreted from satellite galaxies.

0810.5123	photometric constraints on white dwarfs and the identification of  extreme objects	it is possible to reliably identify white dwarfs (wds) without recourse tospectra, instead using photometric and astrometric measurements to distinguishthem from main sequence stars and quasars. wds' colours can also be used toinfer their intrinsic properties (effective temperature, surface gravity,etc.), but the results obtained must be interpreted with care. the difficultiesstem from the existence of a solid angle degeneracy, as revealed by a fullexploration of the likelihood, although this can be masked if a simple best-fitapproach is used. conversely, this degeneracy can be broken if a bayesianapproach is adopted, as it is then possible to utilise the prior information onthe surface gravities of wds implied by spectroscopic fitting. the benefits ofsuch an approach are particularly strong when applied to outliers, such as thecandidate halo and ultra-cool wds identified by vidrih et al. (2007). areanalysis of these samples confirms their results for the latter sample butsuggests that that most of the halo candidates are thick disk wds in the tailsof the photometric noise distribution.

0811.3714	probing spectroscopic variability of galaxies &amp; narrow-line active  galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey	under the unified model for active galactic nuclei (agns), narrow-line (type2) agns are, in fact, broad-line (type 1) agns but each with a heavily obscuredaccretion disk. we would therefore expect the optical continuum emission fromtype 2 agn to be composed mainly of stellar light and non-variable on thetime-scales of months to years. in this work we probe the spectroscopicvariability of galaxies and narrow-line agns using the multi-epoch data in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 6. the sample contains 18,435sources for which there exist pairs of spectroscopic observations (with amaximum separation in time of ~700 days) covering a wavelength range of3900-8900 angstrom. to obtain a reliable repeatability measurement between eachspectral pair, we consider a number of techniques for spectrophotometriccalibration resulting in an improved spectrophotometric calibration of a factorof two. from these data we find no obvious continuum and emission-linevariability in the narrow-line agns on average -- the spectroscopic variabilityof the continuum is 0.07+/-0.26 mag in the g band and, for the emission-lineratios log10([nii]/halpha) and log10([oiii]/hbeta), the variability is0.02+/-0.03 dex and 0.06+/-0.08 dex, respectively. from the continuumvariability measurement we set an upper limit on the ratio between the flux ofvarying spectral component, presumably related to agn activities, and that ofhost galaxy to be ~30%. we provide the corresponding upper limits for otherspectral classes, including those from the bpt diagram, eclass galaxyclassification, stars and quasars.
