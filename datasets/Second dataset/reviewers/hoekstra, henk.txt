0707.1698	the masses and shapes of dark matter halos from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the cfhtls	we present the first galaxy-galaxy weak lensing results using early data fromthe canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls). these results arebased on ~22 sq. deg. of i' data. from this data, we estimate the averagevelocity dispersion for an l* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 to be 137 +- 11 km/s,with a virial mass, m_{200}, of 1.1 +- 0.2 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} msun and arest frame r-band mass-to-light ratio of 173 +- 34 h msun/lsun. we alsoinvestigate various possible sources of systematic error in detail.additionally, we separate our lens sample into two sub-samples, divided byapparent magnitude, thus average redshift. from this early data we do notdetect significant evolution in galaxy dark matter halo mass-to-light ratiosfrom a redshift of 0.45 to 0.27. finally, we test for non-spherical galaxy darkmatter halos. our results favor a dark matter halo with an ellipticity of ~0.3at the 2-sigma level when averaged over all galaxies. if the sample offoreground lens galaxies is selected to favor ellipticals, the mean haloellipticity and significance of this result increase.

0910.3207	structure formation by fifth force: power spectrum from n-body  simulations	we lay out the framework to numerically study nonlinear structure formationin the context of scalar-field-coupled cold dark matter models (phicdm models)where the scalar field phi serves as dynamical dark energy. adopting parametersfor the scalar field which yield a realistic cmb spectrum, we generate theinitial conditions for our nbody simulations, which follow the spatialdistributions of dark matter and the scalar field, by solving their equationsof motion using the multilevel adaptive grid technique. we show that thespatial configuration of the scalar field tracks both the voids and clusters ofdark matter. the phicdm model differs from standard lcdm at small scales withobservable modifications of, e.g., the mass function of halos as well as thematter power spectrum. nevertheless, the predictions of both models for thehubble expansion and the cmb spectrum are virtually indistinguishable. hence,galaxy cluster counts and weak lensing observations, which probe structureformation at small scales, are needed to falsify this class of models.

0911.0053	evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe from weak lensing  tomography with cosmos	we present a tomographic cosmological weak lensing analysis of the hst cosmossurvey. applying our lensing-optimized data reduction, principal componentinterpolation for the acs psf, and improved modelling of charge-transferinefficiency, we measure a lensing signal which is consistent with puregravitational modes and no significant shape systematics. we carefully estimatethe statistical uncertainty from simulated cosmos-like fields obtained fromray-tracing through the millennium simulation. we test our pipeline onsimulated space-based data, recalibrate non-linear power spectrum correctionsusing the ray-tracing, employ photometric redshifts to reduce potentialcontamination by intrinsic galaxy alignments, and marginalize over systematicuncertainties. we find that the lensing signal scales with redshift as expectedfrom general relativity for a concordance lcdm cosmology, including the fullcross-correlations between different redshift bins. for a flat lcdm cosmology,we measure sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^0.51=0.75+-0.08 from lensing, in perfectagreement with wmap-5, yielding joint constraints omega_m=0.266+0.025-0.023,sigma_8=0.802+0.028-0.029 (all 68% conf.). dropping the assumption of flatnessand using hst key project and bbn priors only, we find a negative decelerationparameter q_0 at 94.3% conf. from the tomographic lensing analysis, providingindependent evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe. for a flatwcdm cosmology and prior w in [-2,0], we obtain w&lt;-0.41 (90% conf.). our darkenergy constraints are still relatively weak solely due to the limited area ofcosmos. however, they provide an important demonstration for the usefulness oftomographic weak lensing measurements from space.

1008.1963	substructure lensing in galaxy clusters as a constraint on low-mass  sterile neutrinos in tensor-vector-scalar theory: the straight arc of abell  2390	certain covariant theories of the modified newtonian dynamics paradigm seemto require an additional hot dark matter (hdm) component - in the form ofeither heavy ordinary neutrinos or more recently light sterile neutrinos (sns)with a mass around 11ev - to be relieved of problems ranging from cosmologicalscales down to intermediate ones relevant for galaxy clusters. here we suggestusing gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage ofneutrino hdm and modified gravity, adopting the framework oftensor-vector-scalar theory (teves). unlike conventional cold dark matter(cdm), such hdm is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows oneto check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework forconsistency. since the considered hdm particles cannot collapse intoarbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galacticscale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particularinterest. as a first example, we study the cluster lens abell 2390 and itsimpressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. based on ourresults, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lensesin teves which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. we furtherconsider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straightarc, to demonstrate our approach. we find that such a model is marginallyconsistent with the hypothesis of 11ev sns. future work including more detailedand realistic lens models may further constrain the necessary sn distributionand help to conclusively assess this point. cluster lenses could thereforeprovide an interesting discriminator between cdm and such modified gravityscenarios supplemented by sns or other choices of hdm.

0708.3671	a multiwavelength analysis of the strong lensing cluster rcs  022434-0002.5 at z=0.778	we present the results of two (101 ks total) chandra observations of thez=0.778 optically selected lensing cluster rcs022434-0002.5, along with weaklensing and dynamical analyses of this object. an x-ray spectrum extractedwithin r(2500) (362 h(70)^(-1) kpc) results in an integrated clustertemperature of 5.1 (+0.9,-0.5) kev. the surface brightness profile ofrcs022434-0002.5 indicates the presence of a slight excess of emission in thecore. a hardness ratio image of this object reveals that this central emissionis primarily produced by soft x-rays. further investigation yields a clustercooling time of 3.3 times 10^9 years, which is less than half of the age of theuniverse at this redshift given the current lcdm cosmology. a weak lensinganalysis is performed using hst images, and our weak lensing mass estimate isfound to be in good agreement with the x-ray determined mass of the cluster.spectroscopic analysis reveals that rcs022434-0002.5 has a velocity dispersionof 900 +/- 180 km/s, consistent with its x-ray temperature. the core gas massfraction of rcs022434-0002.5 is, however, found to be three times lower thanexpected universal values. the radial distribution of x-ray point sourceswithin r(200) of this cluster peaks at ~0.7 r(200), possibly indicating thatthe cluster potential is influencing agn activity at that radius. correlationsbetween x-ray and radio (vla) point source positions are also examined.

1011.0549	the mass-l_x relation for moderate luminosity x-ray clusters	we present measurements of the masses of a sample of 25 moderate x-rayluminosity clusters of galaxies from the 160 square degree rosat survey. themasses were obtained from a weak lensing analysis of deep f814w images obtainedusing the advanced camera for surveys (acs). we present an accurate empiricalcorrection for the effect of charge transfer (in)efficiency on the shapes offaint galaxies. a significant lensing signal is detected around most of theclusters. the lensing mass correlates tightly with the cluster richness. wemeasured the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between m_2500 and l_xand find the best fit power law slope and normalisation to be alpha=0.68+-0.07and m_x=(1.2+-0.12)10^14m_sun (for l_x=2x10^44 erg/s). these results agree wellwith a number of recent studies, but the normalisation is lower compared to thestudy of rykoff et al. (2008b). one explanation for this difference may be thefact that (sub)structures projected along the line-of-sight boost both thegalaxy counts and the lensing mass. such superpositions lead to an increasedmass at a given l_x when clusters are binned by richness.

1103.4407	lensing magnification: a novel method to weigh high-redshift clusters  and its application to sparcs	we introduce a novel method to measure the masses of galaxy clusters at highredshift selected from optical and ir spitzer data via the red-sequencetechnique. lyman-break galaxies are used as a well understood, high-redshiftbackground sample allowing mass measurements of lenses at unprecedented highredshifts using weak lensing magnification. by stacking a significant number ofclusters at different redshifts with average masses of ~1-3x10^14m_sun, asestimated from their richness, we can calibrate the normalisation of themass-richness relation. with the current data set (area: 6 deg^2) we detect amagnification signal at the &gt;3-sigma level. there is good agreement between themasses estimated from the richness of the clusters and the average massesestimated from magnification, albeit with large uncertainties. we perform teststhat suggest the absence of strong systematic effects and support therobustness of the measurement. this method - when applied to larger data setsin the future - will yield an accurate calibration of the mass-observablerelations at z&gt;~1 which will represent an invaluable input for cosmologicalstudies using the galaxy cluster mass function and astrophysical studies ofcluster formation. furthermore this method will probably be the least expensiveway to measure masses of large numbers of z&gt;1 clusters detected in futureir-imaging surveys.

1105.1075	quantifying the effect of baryon physics on weak lensing tomography	we use matter power spectra from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations toquantify the effect of baryon physics on the weak gravitational lensing shearsignal. the simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiativecooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei(agn). van daalen et al. (2011) used the same simulations to show that baryonphysics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve theovercooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant forcosmological weak lensing studies. as a result, the use of power spectra fromdark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferredcosmological parameters. we show that the typical biases are much larger thanthe precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energyequation of state, w_0. for instance, the simulation with agn feedback, whichreproduces x-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a~40% bias in w_0. we demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum isdominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can bemodelled. we consider an approach based on the popular halo model and show thatsimple modifications can capture the main features of baryonic feedback.despite its simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on thesimulations, is able to reduce the bias in w_0 to a level comparable to thesize of the statistical uncertainties for a euclid-like mission. whileobservations of the gas and stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can beused to calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely still beneeded to extend the observed scaling relations down to halo masses of 10 ^12m_sun/h.

1107.4093	galaxy-galaxy lensing constraints on the relation between baryons and  dark matter in galaxies in the red sequence cluster survey 2	we present the results of a study of weak gravitational lensing by galaxiesusing imaging data that were obtained as part of the second red sequencecluster survey (rcs2). in order to compare to the baryonic properties of thelenses we focus here on the ~300 square degrees that overlap with the dr7 ofthe sdss. the depth and image quality of the rcs2 enables us to significantlyimprove upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z&gt;=0.3. comparison withdynamical masses from the sdss shows a good correlation with the lensing massfor early-type galaxies. for low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxieswe find a satellite fraction of ~40% which rapidly decreases to &lt;10% withincreasing luminosity (stellar mass). the satellite fraction of the late-typeshas a value in the range 0-15%. we find that early-types in the range10^10&lt;l_r&lt;10^11.5 lsun have virial masses that are about five times higher thanthose of late-type galaxies and that the mass scales as m_200 \propto l^2.34+0.09 \ -0.16. we also measure the virial mass-to-light ratio, and find forl_200&lt;10^11 lsun a value of m_200/l_200=42+-10 for early-types, which increasesfor higher luminosities to values that are consistent with those observed forgroups and clusters of galaxies. for late-type galaxies we find a lower valueof m_200/l_200=17+-9. our measurements also show that early- and late-typegalaxies have comparable halo masses for stellar masses m_*&lt;10^11 msun, whereasthe virial masses of early-type galaxies are higher for higher stellar masses.finally, we determine the efficiency with which baryons have been convertedinto stars. our results for early-type galaxies suggest a variation inefficiency with a minimum of ~10% for a stellar mass m_*,200=10^12 msun. theresults for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do suggest alarger value.

1110.1632	the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey: type ia supernova rate  measurement in z~0.1 clusters and the late-time delay time distribution	we describe the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey (meneacs), designed tomeasure the cluster type ia supernova (sn ia) rate in a sample of 57 x-rayselected galaxy clusters, with redshifts of 0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.15. utilizing our realtime analysis pipeline, we spectroscopically confirmed twenty-three cluster snia, four of which were intracluster events. using our deep cfht/megacamimaging, we measured total stellar luminosities in each of our galaxy clusters,and we performed detailed supernova detection efficiency simulations. bringingthese ingredients together, we measure an overall cluster sn ia rate withinr_{200} (1 mpc) of 0.042^{+0.012}_{-0.010}^{+0.010}_{-0.008} snum(0.049^{+0.016}_{-0.014}^{+0.005}_{-0.004} snum) and a sn ia rate within redsequence galaxies of 0.041^{+0.015}_{-0.015}^{+0.005}_{-0.010} snum(0.041^{+0.019}_{-0.015}^{+0.005}_{-0.004} snum). the red sequence sn ia rateis consistent with published rates in early type/elliptical galaxies in the`field'. using our red sequence sn ia rate, and other cluster sne measurementsin early type galaxies up to $z\sim1$, we derive the late time (&gt;2 gyr) delaytime distribution (dtd) of sn ia assuming a cluster early type galaxy starformation epoch of z_f=3. assuming a power law form for the dtd, \psi(t)\proptot^s, we find s=-1.62\pm0.54. this result is consistent with predictions for thedouble degenerate sn ia progenitor scenario (s\sim-1), and is also in line withrecent calculations for the double detonation explosion mechanism (s\sim-2).the most recent calculations of the single degenerate scenario delay timedistribution predicts an order of magnitude drop off in sn ia rate \sim 6-7 gyrafter stellar formation, and the observed cluster rates cannot rule this out.

1110.4913	the impact of high spatial frequency atmospheric distortions on weak  lensing measurements	high precision cosmology with weak gravitational lensing requires a precisemeasure of the point spread function across the imaging data where the accuracyto which high spatial frequency variation can be modelled is limited by thestellar number density across the field. we analyse dense stellar fields imagedat the canada-france-hawaii telescope to quantify the degree of high spatialfrequency variation in ground-based imaging point spread functions and compareour results to models of atmospheric turbulence. the data shows an anisotropicturbulence pattern with an orientation independent of the wind direction andwind speed. we find the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decreasewith increasing exposure time as $t^{-1/2}$, and find a negligibly smallatmospheric contribution to the point spread function ellipticity variation forexposure times $t&gt;180$ seconds. for future surveys analysing shorter exposuredata, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as theamplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to acosmological lensing signal on scales less than $\sim 10$ arcminutes. thiseffect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured onexposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which wefind the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.

1112.3655	the gemini cluster astrophysics spectroscopic survey (gclass): the role  of environment and self-regulation in galaxy evolution at z ~ 1	we evaluate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxy propertiesat 0.85 &lt; z &lt; 1.20 using a 3.6um-selected spectroscopic sample of 797 clusterand field galaxies drawn from the gclass survey. we confirm that for galaxieswith logm* &gt; 9.3 the well-known correlations between environment and propertiessuch as star-forming fraction (f_sf), sfr, ssfr, d(4000), and color are alreadyin place at z ~ 1. we separate the effects of environment and stellar mass ongalaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies atfixed environment, and fixed stellar mass. the ssfr of star-forming galaxies atfixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellarmass it is independent of environment. the same trend exists for the d(4000)measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that theirproperties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by theirenvironment. instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to controlthe fraction of star-forming galaxies. using the spectra we identify candidatepoststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 &lt; logm* &lt; 10.7 are 3.1 +/-1.1 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions.the clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well asthe lack of a correlation between the ssfrs and d(4000)s of star-forminggalaxies with their environment suggests that at z ~ 1 theenvironmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. lastly, we construct a simplequenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between thed(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if selfquenching dominates over environmental quenching at z &gt; 1, or if the evolutionof the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenchingrate at z &gt; 1, regardless of which dominates.

1203.2616	on combining galaxy clustering and weak lensing to unveil galaxy biasing  via the halo model	we formulate the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in theframework of halo occupation statistics. using two-point statistics inprojection, we define the galaxy bias function, b_g(r_p), and the galaxy-darkmatter cross-correlation function, r_{gm}(r_p), where r_p is the projecteddistance. we use the analytical halo model to predict how the scale dependenceof b_g and r_{gm}, over the range 0.1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 30 mpc/h, depends on thenon-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models. in particular wequantify the effect due to the presence of central galaxies, the assumption forthe radial distribution of satellite galaxies, the richness of the halo, andthe poisson character of the probability to have a certain number of satellitegalaxies in a halo of a certain mass. overall, brighter galaxies reveal astronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. in real-space, we findthat galaxy bias becomes scale independent, with r_{gm} = 1, for radii r &gt; 1 -5 mpc/h, depending on luminosity. however, galaxy bias is scale-dependent outto much larger radii when one uses the projected quantities defined in thispaper. these projected bias functions have the advantage that they are moreeasily accessible observationally and that their scale dependence carries awealth of information regarding the properties of galaxy biasing. toobservationally constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics andto unveil the origin of galaxy biasing we propose the use of the bias functiongamma_{gm}(r_p)=b_g(r_p)/r_{gm}(r_p). this function is obtained via acombination of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, and it can bemeasured using existing and forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic galaxysurveys.

1206.1525	a giant metrewave radio telescope/chandra view of iras 09104+4109: a  type 2 qso in a cooling flow	iras 09104+4109 is a rare example of a dust enshrouded type 2 qso in thecentre of a cool-core galaxy cluster. previous observations of this z=0.44system showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission ofthe cluster-central galaxy, the qso is associated with a double-lobed radiosource. however, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between thejets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the qso hadrecently changed. we use a combination of new, multi-band giant metrewave radiotelescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are nolonger powered by the qso, and estimate their age to be 120-160 myr. this is inagreement with the ~70-200 myr age previously estimated for star-formation inthe galaxy. previously unpublished very long baseline array data reveal a 200pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely alignedwith the current qso axis and may represent a more recent period of jetactivity. these results suggest that the realignment of the qso, the cessationof jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused bya gas-rich galaxy merger. a chandra x-ray observation confirms the presence ofcavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required toinflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. the mechanical power of the jets issufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they areefficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (icm). we find no evidence ofdirect radiative heating and conclude that the qso either lacks the radiativeluminosity to heat the icm, or that it requires longer than 100-200 myr tosignificantly impact its environment.

1206.4304	constraints on the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes from weak  gravitational lensing	we study the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes by measuring the anisotropyof the weak gravitational lensing signal around galaxies in the secondred-sequence cluster survey (rcs2). we determine the average shear anisotropywithin the virial radius for three lens samples: all galaxies with19&lt;m_r'&lt;21.5, and the `red' and `blue' samples, whose lensing signals aredominated by massive low-redshift early-type and late-type galaxies,respectively. to study the environmental dependence of the lensing signal, weseparate each lens sample into an isolated and clustered part and analyse themseparately. we also measure the azimuthal dependence of the distribution ofphysically associated galaxies around the lens samples. we find that thesesatellites preferentially reside near the major axis of the lenses, andconstrain the angle between the major axis of the lens and the average locationof the satellites to &lt;theta&gt;=43.7 deg +/- 0.3 deg for the `all' lenses,&lt;theta&gt;=41.7 deg +/- 0.5 deg for the `red' lenses and &lt;theta&gt;=42.0 deg +/- 1.4deg for the `blue' lenses. for the `all' sample, we find that the anisotropy ofthe galaxy-mass cross-correlation function &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.23 +/- 0.12, providingweak support for the view that the average galaxy is embedded in, andpreferentially aligned with, a triaxial dark matter halo. assuming anelliptical navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, we find that the ratio of thedark matter halo ellipticity and the galaxy ellipticityf_h=e_h/e_g=1.50+1.03-1.01, which for a mean lens ellipticity of 0.25corresponds to a projected halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38+0.26-0.25 if the haloand the lens are perfectly aligned. for isolated galaxies of the `all' sample,the average shear anisotropy increases to &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.51+0.26-0.25 andf_h=4.73+2.17-2.05, whilst for clustered galaxies the signal is consistent withzero.

1210.7303	effect of baryonic feedback on two- and three-point shear statistics:  prospects for detection and improved modelling	accurate knowledge of the effect of feedback from galaxy formation on thematter distribution is a key requirement for future weak lensing experiments.recent studies using hydrodynamic simulations have shown that differentbaryonic feedback scenarios lead to significantly different two-point shearstatistics. in this paper we extend earlier work to three-point shearstatistics. we show that, relative to the predictions of dark matter onlymodels, the amplitude of the signal can be reduced by as much as 30-40% onscales of a few arcminutes. we find that baryonic feedback may affect two- andthree-point shear statistics differently and demonstrate that this can be usedto assess the fidelity of various feedback models. in particular, upcomingsurveys such as euclid might be able to discriminate between different feedbackmodels by measuring both second- and third-order statistics. because it willlikely remain impossible to predict baryonic feedback with high accuracy fromfirst principles, we argue in favour of phenomenological models that cancapture the relevant effects of baryonic feedback processes in addition tochanges in cosmology. we construct such a model by modifying the darkmatter-only halo model to characterise the generic effects of energeticfeedback using a small number of parameters. we use this model to perform alikelihood analysis in a simplified case in which two- and three-point shearstatistics are measured between 0.5 and 20 arcmin and in which the amplitude offluctuations, sigma8, the matter density parameter, om, and the dark energyparameter, w0, are the only unknown free parameters. we demonstrate that forweak lensing surveys such as euclid, marginalising over the feedbac parametersdescribing the effects of baryonic processes, such as outflows driven byfeedback from star formation and agn, may be able to mitigate the biasaffecting om, sigma8 and w0.

1210.7690	origins of weak lensing systematics, and requirements on future  instrumentation (or knowledge of instrumentation)	the first half of this paper explores the origin of systematic biases in themeasurement of weak gravitational lensing. compared to previous work, we expandthe investigation of psf instability and fold in for the first time the effectsof non-idealities in electronic imaging detectors and imperfect galaxy shapemeasurement algorithms. together, these now explain the additive a(l) andmultiplicative m(l) systematics typically reported in current lensingmeasurements. we find that overall performance is driven by a product of atelescope/camera's *absolute performance*, and our *knowledge about itsperformance*.  the second half of this paper propagates any residual shear measurementbiases through to their effect on cosmological parameter constraints. fullyexploiting the statistical power of stage iv weak lensing surveys will requireadditive biases a&lt;1.8e-12 and multiplicative biases m&lt;4.0e-3. these can beallocated between individual budgets in hardware, calibration data andsoftware, using results from the first half of the paper.  if instrumentation is stable and well-calibrated, we find extant shearmeasurement software from great10 already meet requirements on galaxiesdetected at s/n=40. averaging over a population of galaxies with a realisticdistribution of sizes, it also meets requirements for a 2d cosmic shearanalysis from space. if used on fainter galaxies or for 3d cosmic sheartomography, existing algorithms would need calibration on simulations to avoidintroducing bias at a level similar to the statistical error. requirements onhardware and calibration data are discussed in more detail in a companionpaper. our analysis is intentionally general, but is specifically being used todrive the hardware and ground segment performance budget for the design of theeuropean space agency's recently-selected euclid mission.

1211.0543	stellar mass versus velocity dispersion as tracer of the lensing signal  around bulge-dominated galaxies	we present the results of a weak gravitational lensing analysis to determinewhether the stellar mass or the velocity dispersion is more closely related tothe amplitude of the lensing signal around galaxies - and hence to theprojected distribution of dark matter. the lensing signal on scales smallerthan the virial radius corresponds most closely to the lensing velocitydispersion in the case of a singular isothermal profile, but is on largerscales also sensitive to the clustering of the haloes. we select over 4000 lensgalaxies at a redshift z&lt;0.2 with concentrated (or bulge-dominated) surfacebrightness profiles from the ~300 square degree overlap between thered-sequence cluster survey 2 (rcs2) and the data release 7 (dr7) of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we consider both the spectroscopic velocitydispersion and a model velocity dispersion (a combination of the stellar mass,the size and the sersic index of a galaxy). comparing the model andspectroscopic velocity dispersion we find that they correlate well for galaxieswith concentrated brightness profiles. we find that the stellar mass and thespectroscopic velocity dispersion trace the amplitude of the lensing signal onsmall scales equally well. the model velocity dispersion, however, doessignificantly worse. a possible explanation is that the halo properties thatdetermine the small-scale lensing signal - mainly the total mass - also dependon the structural parameters of galaxies, such as the effective radius andsersic index, but we lack data for a definitive conclusion.

1211.5025	on the shear estimation bias induced by the spatial variation of colour  across galaxy profiles	the spatial variation of the colour of a galaxy may introduce a bias in themeasurement of its shape if the psf profile depends on wavelength. we study howthis bias depends on the properties of the psf and the galaxies themselves. thebias depends on the scales used to estimate the shape, which may be used tooptimise methods to reduce the bias. here we develop a general approach toquantify the bias. although applicable to any weak lensing survey, we focus onthe implications for the esa euclid mission.  based on our study of synthetic galaxies we find that the bias is a few times10^-3 for a typical galaxy observed by euclid. consequently, it cannot beneglected and needs to be accounted for. we demonstrate how one can do so usingspatially resolved observations of galaxies in two filters. we show that hstobservations in the f606w and f814w filters allow us to model and reduce thebias by an order of magnitude, sufficient to meet euclid's scientificrequirements. the precision of the correction is ultimately determined by thenumber of galaxies for which spatially-resolved observations in at least twofilters are available. we use results from the millennium simulation todemonstrate that archival hst data will be sufficient for the tomographiccosmic shear analysis with the euclid dataset.

1301.7421	cfhtlens: the environmental dependence of galaxy halo masses from weak  lensing	we use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos aroundsatellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the cfhtlens dataset. this dataset isderived from the cfhtls-wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg ofhigh-quality shape data. using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sampleof lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 msun to 10^10.5 msuninto those likely to lie in high-density environments (hde) and those likely tolie in low-density environments (lde). through comparison with galaxycatalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, we show that the sample ofhde galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups,while the sample of lde galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite(field and central) galaxies. comparing the lensing signals around samples ofhde and lde galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around hdegalaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on theirlensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation betweensatellites and group centres. more importantly, the subhalos of hde galaxiesare less massive than those around lde galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12,significant at the 2.9 sigma level. a natural explanation is that the halos ofsatellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment.our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc.

1303.1806	cfhtlens: mapping the large scale structure with gravitational lensing	we present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps ofprojected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. we use datafrom the 154 deg2 covered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey.our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientificvalue of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementaryapproach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. we showthat mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that oftraditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. using a series ofnumerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the cfhtlens observingconditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of theprojected matter distribution of large scale structure. we validate ouranalysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statisticalestimators. we then apply the same process to the cfhtlens data. we find thatthe 2-points correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with thecosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed inthe cfhtlens companion papers. the maps also lead to a significant measurementof the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement withanalytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment.tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for thestatistical estimators we used. a new approach for the comparison of thereconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution revealsthe existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees onthe sky. our analysis shows that lensing mass maps can be used for newtechniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of theprojected dark matter distribution.

1304.4265	cfhtlens: the relation between galaxy dark matter haloes and baryons  from weak gravitational lensing	we present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and thebaryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass.our investigation uses 154 deg2 of canada-france-hawaii telescope lensingsurvey (cfhtlens) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the cfht legacysurvey. we employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us toconstrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. our analysis is limited tolenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. we express the relationship betweenhalo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. for the luminosity-halo massrelation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies thebest-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13h70^-1 msun. similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and anormalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 msun for the stellar mass-halomass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding valuesare 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 msun. for red lenses, thefraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellarmass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9h70^-2 msun. the satellite fractions are generally close to zero for bluelenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. this, together with theshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a directconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in lessclustered environments than red galaxies. we also find that the halo model,while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone toover-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.this could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolatedthan assumed.

(1) we findthat the central galaxy stellar mass fraction decreases with total halo mass,and that this is in reasonable quantitative agreement with measurements fromabundance matching studies at z~1. (2) the total stellar mass fractions ofthese systems decrease with halo mass, indicating that lower mass systems aremore efficient at transforming baryons into stars. we find the total stellarmass to be a good proxy for total halo mass, with a small intrinsic scatter.when we compare these results with literature measurements, we find that thestellar mass fraction at fixed halo mass shows no significant evolution in therange 0&lt;z&lt;1. (3) we measure a relatively high nfw concentration parameter c ~ 7for the stellar mass distribution in these clusters. a simple model shows thatthe stellar mass content of gclass can evolve in typical distributions observedat lower redshifts if the clusters primarily accrete stellar mass onto theoutskirts.

1310.6784	cfhtlens: co-evolution of galaxies and their dark matter haloes	galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distributionaround galaxies. the depth and sky coverage of the cfht legacy survey yieldstatistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider rangeof stellar masses ($10^{8.75}$ to $10^{11.3} m_{\odot}$) and redshifts ($0.2 &lt;z &lt; 0.8$) than previous weak lensing studies. at redshift $z \sim 0.5$, thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr) reaches a maximum of $4.0\pm0.2$ percent as afunction of halo mass at $\sim 10^{12.25} m_{\odot}$. we find, for the firsttime from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the shmr:the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from $4.5 \pm 0.3$ percent at$z \sim 0.7$ to $3.4 \pm 0.2$ percent at $z \sim 0.3$, and shifts to lowerstellar mass haloes. these evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies,and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which starformation is quenched "downsizes" with cosmic time. in contrast, the shmr ofblue, star-forming galaxies is well-fit by a power law that does not evolvewith time. this suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that isbalanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve alongthe shmr locus. the redshift dependence of the shmr can be used to constrainthe evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.

1402.7077	the phase space and stellar populations of cluster galaxies at z ~ 1:  simultaneous constraints on the location and timescale of satellite quenching	we investigate the velocity vs. position phase space of z ~ 1 clustergalaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic redshifts in 9 clusters drawn fromthe gclass survey. dividing the galaxy population into three categories:quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations havedistinct distributions in phase space. most striking are the poststarburstgalaxies, which are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with highclustercentric velocities, and appear to trace a coherent ``ring" in phasespace. using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherentdistribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using asimple quenching scenario. specifically, the phase space is best reproduced ifsatellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 &lt; tau_{q} &lt; 0.5 gyr) aftergalaxies make their first passage of r ~ 0.5r_{200}, a process that takes atotal time of ~ 1 gyr after first infall. we compare this quenching timescaleto the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburstgalaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapidquenching (tau_{q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy.the similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independentindicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. given that themodel implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within r_{200},this would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gascomponent of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physicalmechanism. the high cold gas consumption rates at z ~ 1 make it difficult todetermine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements ofthe redshift evolution of the satellite quenching timescale and location may becapable of distinguishing between the two.

1404.5469	cfhtlens: cosmological constraints from a combination of cosmic shear  two-point and three-point correlations	higher-order, non-gaussian aspects of the large-scale structure carryvaluable information on structure formation and cosmology, which iscomplementary to second-order statistics. in this work we measure second- andthird-order weak-lensing aperture-mass moments from cfhtlens and combine thosewith cmb anisotropy probes. the third moment is measured with a significance of$2\sigma$. the combined constraint on $\sigma_8 = \sigma_8 (\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^\alpha$ is improved by 10%, in comparison to the second-order only,and the allowed ranges for $\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ are substantiallyreduced. including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighterconstraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles. second- andthird-order cfhtlens lensing measurements improve planck cmb constraints on$\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ by 26% for flat $\lambda$cdm. for a model withfree curvature, the joint cfhtlens-planck result is $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.28 \pm0.02$ (68% confidence), which is an improvement of 43% compared to planckalone. we test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysicalsources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment ofgalaxy shapes, and baryonic effects. we explore future limitations of thecosmological use of third-order weak lensing, such as the nonlinear model andthe gaussianity of the likelihood function.

1406.5196	constraints on the alignment of galaxies in galaxy clusters from  $\sim$14,000 spectroscopic members	torques acting on galaxies lead to physical alignments, but the resultingellipticity correlations are difficult to predict. as they constitute a majorcontaminant for cosmic shear studies, it is important to constrain theintrinsic alignment signal observationally. we measured the alignments ofsatellite galaxies within 90 massive galaxy clusters in the redshift range0.05&lt;z&lt;0.55 and quantified their impact on the cosmic shear signal. we combineda sample of 38,104 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with high-quality datafrom the canada-france-hawaii telescope. we used phase-space information toselect 14,576 cluster members, 14,250 of which have shape measurements andmeasured three different types of alignment: the radial alignment of satellitegalaxies toward the brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs), the common orientationsof satellite galaxies and bcgs, and the radial alignments of satellites witheach other. residual systematic effects are much smaller than the statisticaluncertainties. we detect no galaxy alignment of any kind out to at least 3r200. the signal is consistent with zero for both blue and red galaxies, brightand faint ones, and also for subsamples of clusters based on redshift,dynamical mass, and dynamical state. these conclusions are unchanged if weexpand the sample with bright cluster members from the red sequence. we augmentour constraints with those from the literature to estimate the importance ofthe intrinsic alignments of satellites compared to those of central galaxies,for which the alignments are described by the linear alignment model.comparison of the alignment signals to the expected uncertainties of currentsurveys such as the kilo-degree survey suggests that the linear alignment modelis an adequate treatment of intrinsic alignments, but it is not clear whetherthis will be the case for larger surveys.

1410.2898	mc^2: constraining the dark matter distribution of the violent merging  galaxy cluster ciza j2242.8+5301 by piercing through the milky way	ciza j2242.8+5301 is a merging system with a prominent (~2 mpc long) radiorelic, which together with the morphology of the x-ray emission provides strongevidence for a violent collision along the n-s axis. we present our constraintson the dark matter distribution of this unusual system using subaru and cfhtimaging data. measuring a high s/n lensing signal from this cluster ispotentially a challenging task because of its proximity to the milky way plane(|b|~5 deg). we overcome this challenge with careful observation planning andsystematics control, which enables us to successfully map the dark matterdistribution of the cluster with high fidelity. the resulting mass map showsthat the mass distribution is highly elongated along the n-s merger axisinferred from the orientation of the radio relics. based on our massreconstruction, we identify two sub-clusters, which coincide with the clustergalaxy distributions. we determine their masses using mcmc analysis bysimultaneously fitting two nfw halos without fixing their centroids. theresulting masses of the northern and southern systems are$m_{200}=11.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\times10^{14} m_{\sun}$ and$9.8_{-2.5}^{+3.8}\times10^{14} m_{\sun}$, respectively, indicating that we arewitnessing a post-collision of two giant systems of nearly equal mass. when themass and galaxy centroids are compared in detail, we detect ~ 1' (~190 kpc)offsets in both northern and southern sub-clusters. we find that the galaxyluminosity-mass offset for the northern clump is statistically significant atthe ~2 sigma level whereas the detection is only marginal for the southernsub-cluster in part because of a relatively large mass centroid error. weconclude that it is yet premature to uniquely attribute the galaxy-massmisalignment to sidm and discuss caveats.

1412.2137	evidence for the inside-out growth of the stellar mass distribution in  galaxy clusters since z~1	we study the radial number density and stellar mass density distributions ofsatellite galaxies in a sample of 60 massive clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.26 selectedfrom the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey (meneacs) and the canadian clustercomparison project (cccp). in addition to ~10,000 spectroscopically confirmedmember galaxies, we use deep ugri-band imaging to estimate photometricredshifts and stellar masses, and then statistically subtract fore-, andbackground sources using data from the cosmos survey. we measure the galaxynumber density and stellar mass density distributions in logarithmically spacedbins over 2 orders of magnitude in radial distance from the bcgs. for projecteddistances in the range 0.1&lt;r/r200&lt;2.0, we find that the stellar massdistribution is well-described by an nfw profile with a concentration ofc=2.03+/-0.20. however, at smaller radii we measure a significant excess in thestellar mass in satellite galaxies of about $10^{11}$ msun per cluster,compared to these nfw profiles. we do obtain good fits to generalized nfwprofiles with free inner slopes, and to einasto profiles. to examine howclusters assemble their stellar mass component over cosmic time, we comparethis local sample to the gclass cluster sample at z~1, which represents theapproximate progenitor sample of the low-z clusters. this allows for a directcomparison, which suggests that the central parts (r&lt;0.4 mpc) of the stellarmass distributions of satellites in local galaxy clusters are already in placeat z~1, and contain sufficient excess material for further bcg growth. evolvingtowards z=0, clusters appear to assemble their stellar mass primarily onto theoutskirts, making them grow in an inside-out fashion.

1503.08647	evolution of the luminosity-to-halo mass relation of lrgs from a  combined sdss-dr10+rcs2 analysis	we study the evolution of the luminosity-to-halo mass relation of luminousred galaxies (lrgs). we select a sample of 52 000 lowz and cmass lrgs from thebaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sdss-dr10 in the ~450 deg^2 thatoverlaps with imaging data from the second red-sequence cluster survey (rcs2),group them into bins of absolute magnitude and redshift and measure their weaklensing signals. the source redshift distribution has a median of 0.7, whichallows us to study the lensing signal as a function of lens redshift. weinterpret the lensing signal using a halo model, from which we obtain the halomasses as well as the normalisations of the mass-concentration relations. wefind that the concentration of haloes that host lrgs is consistent with darkmatter only simulations once we allow for miscentering or satellites in themodelling. the slope of the luminosity-to-halo mass relation has a typicalvalue of 1.4 and does not change with redshift, but we do find evidence for achange in amplitude: the average halo mass of lowz galaxies increases by25_{-14}^{+16} % between z=0.36 and 0.22 to an average value of 6.43+/-0.52 x10^13 h70^-1 msun. if we extend the redshift range using the cmass galaxies andassume that they are the progenitors of the lowz sample, we find that theaverage mass of lrgs increases by 80^{+39}_{-28} % between z=0.6 and 0.2

1507.06996	intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report results for the alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owlssimulations as a function of galaxy separation and halo mass. the combinationof these hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four orders ofmagnitude in halo mass ($10.7&lt;log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot])&lt;15$) and alarge range of separations ($-1&lt;log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc])&lt; 2$). we focus on twoclasses of alignments: the orientations of galaxies with respect to either thedirections to, or the orientations of, surrounding galaxies. we find that thestrength of the alignment is a strongly decreasing function of the distancebetween galaxies. the orientation-direction alignment can remain significant upto ~100 mpc, for galaxies hosted by the most massive haloes in our simulations.galaxies hosted by more massive subhaloes show stronger alignment. at a fixedhalo mass, more aspherical or prolate galaxies exhibit stronger alignments. thespatial distribution of satellites is anisotropic and significantly alignedwith the major axis of the main host halo. the major axis of satellitegalaxies, when all stars are considered, are preferentially aligned towards thecentre of the main host halo. the predicted projected direction-orientationalignment, $\epsilon_{g+}(r_{p})$, is in broad agreement with recentobservations when only stars within the typical observable extent of a galaxyare used to define galaxy orientations. we find that theorientation-orientation alignment is weaker than the orientation-directionalignment on all scales. overall, the strength of galaxy alignments dependsstrongly on the subset of stars that are used to measure the orientations ofgalaxies and it is always weaker than the alignment of the dark matter haloes.thus, alignment models that use halo orientation as a direct proxy for galaxyorientation will overestimate the impact of intrinsic alignments on weaklensing analyses.

1509.03318	mapping the galaxy color-redshift relation: optimal photometric redshift  calibration strategies for cosmology surveys	calibrating the photometric redshifts of &gt;10^9 galaxies for upcoming weaklensing cosmology experiments is a major challenge for the astrophysicscommunity. the path to obtaining the required spectroscopic redshifts fortraining and calibration is daunting, given the anticipated depths of thesurveys and the difficulty in obtaining secure redshifts for some faint galaxypopulations. here we present an analysis of the problem based on theself-organizing map, a method of mapping the distribution of data in ahigh-dimensional space and projecting it onto a lower-dimensionalrepresentation. we apply this method to existing photometric data from thecosmos survey selected to approximate the anticipated euclid weak lensingsample, enabling us to robustly map the empirical distribution of galaxies inthe multidimensional color space defined by the expected euclid filters.mapping this multicolor distribution lets us determine where - in galaxy colorspace - redshifts from current spectroscopic surveys exist and where they aresystematically missing. crucially, the method lets us determine whether aspectroscopic training sample is representative of the full photometric spaceoccupied by the galaxies in a survey. we explore optimal sampling techniquesand estimate the additional spectroscopy needed to map out the color-redshiftrelation, finding that sampling the galaxy distribution in color space in asystematic way can efficiently meet the calibration requirements. while theanalysis presented here focuses on the euclid survey, similar analysis can beapplied to other surveys facing the same calibration challenge, such as des,lsst, and wfirst.

1511.07344	evidence for a change in the dominant satellite galaxy quenching  mechanism at z=1	we present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2$,from the gclass and geec2 spectroscopic surveys. we compute a "conversionfraction" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that wereprematurely quenched by their environment. for massive galaxies, $m_{\rmstar}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. thismeans the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final starformation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ gyr. this is substantially longer than theestimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero onceit starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which littledifferential evolution occurs. in contrast with local observations we findevidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$approaching $t_{\rm hubble}$ for $m_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}m_\odot$. the resultsuggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with asimple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. instead, we find the dataare well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to"overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation andexpulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newlyaccreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

astro-ph;0102368	the effect of distant large scale structure on weak lensing mass  estimates	we quantify the uncertainty in weak lensing mass estimates of clusters ofgalaxies, caused by distant (uncorrelated) large scale structure along the lineof sight. we find that the effect is fairly small for deep observations(20&lt;r&lt;26) of massive clusters (sigma=1000 km/s) at intermediate redshifts,where the bulk of the sources are at high redshifts compared to the clusterredshift. if the lensing signal is measured out to 1.5 h_{50}^{-1} mpc thetypical 1sigma relative uncertainty in the mass is about 6%. however, in othersituations the induced uncertainty can be larger. for instance, in the case ofnearby clusters, such as the coma cluster, background structures introduce aconsiderable uncertainty in the mass, limiting the maximum achievable s/n-ratioto \sim 7, even for deep observations. the noise in the cluster mass estimatecaused by the large scale structure increases with increasing aperture size,which will also complicate attempts to constrain cluster mass profiles at largedistances from the cluster centre. however, the distant large scale structurestudied here can be considered an additional (statistical) source of error, andby averaging the results of several clusters the noise is decreased.

astro-ph;0205205	current status of weak gravitational lensing	weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by foreground structures hasproven to be a powerful tool to study the mass distribution in the universe.nowadays, attention has shifted from clusters of galaxies to the statisticalproperties of the large scale structures and the halos of (field) galaxies.these applications have become feasible with the advent of panoramic cameras on4m class telescopes. in this review we will give an overview of recent advancesin this fast evolving field of astronomy. we start with a discussion of therecent measurements of weak lensing by large scale structure (``cosmicshear''), which can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. we also showhow weak lensing can be used to measure the relation between galaxies and darkmatter (galaxy biasing) directly. another area that benefitted greatly from thecurrent data is the weak lensing by galaxies (galaxy-galaxy lensing). weaklensing provides a unique probe of the gravitational potential on large scales.hence, in the context of dark matter, it can provide constrains on the extentand shapes of dark matter halos. furthermore, it can test alternative theoriesof gravity (without dark matter). the best constraint comes from the firstdetection of the anisotropy of the lensing signal around lens galaxies, whichsuggest that the dark matter halos are flattened. an isotropic signal, aspredicted by mond, is excluded with 99% confidence.

astro-ph;0208351	how well can we determine cluster mass profiles from weak lensing?	weak gravitational lensing provides a direct way to study the massdistribution of clusters of galaxies at large radii. unfortunately, large scalestructure along the line of sight also contributes to the lensing signal, andconsequently affects the measurements. we quantify the effect of distantuncorrelated large scale structure on the inferred mass profile of clusters asmeasured from weak lensing. we consider nfw profiles, and find that large scalestructure is a major source of uncertainty for most practical situations, whena model, with the mass m_200 and the concentration parameter c as freeparameters, is fit to the observations. we find that the best constraints arefound for clusters at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3). for a cluster at z=0.3,optimal results are obtained when the lensing signal is measured out to 10-15arcminutes. measurements at larger radii do not improve the accuracy with whichthe profile can be determined, contrary to what is expected when thecontribution from large scale structure is ignored. the true uncertainties inm_200 and the concentration parameter c are ~2 times larger than when distantlarge scale structure is not included in the error budget.

astro-ph;0303341	the incidence of strong-lensing clusters in the red-sequence cluster  survey	the incidence of giant arcs due to strong-lensing clusters of galaxies isknown to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. this resultderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in theframework of the currently favored $\lambda$cdm cosmology, and one possibleexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.in this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the red-sequencecluster survey (rcs), which again shows significant disagreement withtheoretical predictions. we briefly describe a total of eight strong lenssystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. based on thedetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arcsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in thecurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.specifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall highredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population isresponsible for much of the observed lensing. the lack of lensing clusters at$z&lt;0.64$ in the rcs indicates that a property associated with clusters at earlytimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination ofellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changesin the cluster mass profiles is responsible. cluster mass, which should evolveto globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the mostsignificant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.

astro-ph;0306097	the effect of imperfect corrections of psf anisotropy on cosmic shear  measurements	current measurements of the weak lensing signal induced by large scalestructure provide useful constraints on a range of cosmological parameters.however, the ultimate succes of this technique depends on the accuracy withwhich one can correct for the effect of the point spread function (psf). inthis paper we examine the accuracy of the psf anisotropy correction usingimages of fields with a large number of stars. the ellipticity correlationfunction of the residuals is studied to quantify the effect of imperfectcorrections for psf anisotropy on cosmic shear studies. these imperfectionsoccur on the chip scale and consequently the systematic signal decreasesrapidly with increasing angular scale. separation of the signal into ``e''(curl-free) and ``b'' (curl) components can help to identify the presence ofresidual systematics, but in general, the amplitude of the ``b''-mode isdifferent from that of the ``e''-mode. the study of fields with many stars canbe beneficial in finding a proper description of the variation of psfanisotropy, and consequently help to significantly improve the accuracy withwhich the cosmic shear signal can be measured. we show that with such anapproach it is feasible that the accuracy of future cosmic shear studies islimited by the statistical noise introduced by the intrinsic shapes of thesources. in particular, the prospects for accurate measurements of the cosmicshear signal on scales larger than ~10 arcminutes are excellent.

astro-ph;0603588	cosmological constraints from the red-sequence cluster survey	[abridged] we present a first cosmological analysis of a refined clustercatalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). the input cluster sample isderived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] the catalog contains956 clusters over 0.35&lt;z&lt;0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.the calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked againstpublicly available sloan digital sky survey imaging [...] we analyze thecluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter inthe mass-richness relation [...]. we fit simultaneously for omega_m andsigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness tomass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.the principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (orlack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster massobservables) and available results on both from independent measures. from anunconstrained analysis, omega_m and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. an analysis including gaussian priors on the slopeand zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. both analyses are in good agreement with thecurrent literature. the parameters describing the mass-richness relation in theunconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existingfollow-up data on both the rcs-1 and other cluster samples. our resultsdirectly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with muchlarger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probesof cosmology.

astro-ph;0603696	redshift and shear calibration: impact on cosmic shear studies and  survey design	the cosmological interpretation of weak lensing by large-scale structuresrequires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies. currentlensing surveys are often calibrated using external redshift samples which spana significantly smaller sky area in comparison to the lensing survey, and arethus subject to sample variance. some future lensing surveys are expected to becalibrated in the same way, in particular the fainter galaxy populations wherethe entire color coverage, and hence photometric redshift estimate, could bechallenging to obtain. using n-body simulations, we study the impact of thissample variance on cosmic shear analysis and show that, to first approximation,it behaves like a shear calibration error 1+/-epsilon. using the hubble deepfield as a redshift calibration survey could therefore be a problem for currentlensing surveys. we discuss the impact of the redshift distribution samplingerror and a shear calibration error on the design of future lensing surveys,and find that a lensing survey of area theta square degrees and limitingmagnitude m_lim}, has a minimum shear and redshift calibration accuracyrequirements given by epsilon = epsilon_0 10^{beta(m_lim-24.5)} / sqrt(theta/200). above that limit, lensing surveys would not reach their full potential.using the galaxy number counts from the hubble ultra-deep field, we find(epsilon_0,beta)=(0.015,-0.18) and (epsilon_0,beta)=(0.011,-0.23) for groundand space based surveys respectively. lensing surveys with no or limitedredshift information and/or poor shear calibration accuracy will loose theirpotential to analyse the cosmic shear signal in the sub-degree angular scales,and therefore complete photometric redshift coverage should be a top priorityfor future lensing surveys.

astro-ph;0604289	clusters of galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 : the spitzer adaptation of the  red-sequence cluster survey	as the densest galaxy environments in the universe, clusters are vital to ourunderstanding of the role that environment plays in galaxy formation andevolution. unfortunately, the evolution of high-redshift cluster galaxies ispoorly understood because of the ``cluster desert'' that exists at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.the sparcs collaboration is currently carrying out a 1-passband (z') imagingsurvey which, when combined with the pre-existing 50 square degree 3.6 micronspitzer swire legacy survey data, will efficiently detect hundreds of clustersin the cluster desert using an infrared application of the well-proven clusterred-sequence technique. we have already tested this 1-color (z' - [3.6])approach using a 6 square degree ``pilot patch'' and shown it to be extremelysuccessful at detecting clusters at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. the clusters discovered in thisproject will be the first large sample of ``nascent'' galaxy clusters whichconnect the star-forming proto-cluster regions at z &gt; 2 to the quiescentpopulation at z &lt; 1. the existing seven-passband spitzer data (3.6, 4.5, 5.8,8.0, 24, 70, 160 micron) will allow us to make the first measurements of theevolution of the cluster red-sequence, ir luminosity function, and the mid-irdust-obscured star-formation rate for 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 clusters.

astro-ph;0608643	the shear testing programme 2: factors affecting high precision weak  lensing analyses	the shear testing programme (step) is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of weak lensing measurement, in preparation for thenext generation of wide-field surveys. we review sixteen current and emergingshear measurement methods in a common language, and assess their performance byrunning them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.we determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recoverthe input parameters. we achieve previously unattained discriminatory precisionin our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs ofgalaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removingnoise from their intrinsic ellipticities. the robustness of our simulationapproach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods onreal data.  weak lensing measurement has improved since the first step paper. severalmethods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still beingdeveloped. however, the simulations can now distinguish all methods fromperfect performance. our main concern continues to be the potential for amultiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not beinternally calibrated with real data. we determine which galaxy populations areresponsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we alsoinvestigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. we haveisolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,in which focussed development could provide further progress towards thesub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

astro-ph;0609334	multiwavelength mass comparisons of the z~0.3 cnoc cluster sample	results are presented from a detailed analysis of optical and x-rayobservations of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters from the canadian network forobservational cosmology (cnoc) subsample of the emss. the combination ofextensive optical and deep x-ray observations of these clusters make them idealcandidates for multiwavelength mass comparison studies. x-ray surfacebrightness profiles of 14 clusters with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.55 are constructed fromchandra observations and fit to single and double beta-models. spatiallyresolved temperature analysis is performed, indicating that five of theclusters in this sample exhibit temperature gradients within their inner 60-200kpc. integrated spectra extracted within r_2500 provide temperature, abundance,and luminosity information. under assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium andspherical symmetry, we derive gas and total masses within r_2500 and r_200. wefind an average gas mass fraction within r_200 of 0.136 +/- 0.004, resulting inomega_m=0.28 +/- 0.01 (formal error). we also derive dynamical masses for theseclusters to r_200. we find no systematic bias between x-ray and dynamicalmethods across the sample, with an average m(dyn)/m(x-ray) = 0.97 +/- 0.05. wealso compare x-ray masses to weak lensing mass estimates of a subset of oursample, resulting in a weighted average of m(lens)/m(x-ray) of 0.99 +/- 0.07.we investigate x-ray scaling relationships and find powerlaw slopes which areslightly steeper than the predictions of self-similar models, with an e(z)^(-1)lx-tx slope of 2.4 +/- 0.2 and an e(z) m_2500-tx slope of 1.7 +/- 0.1.relationships between red-sequence optical richness (b_gc,red) and globalcluster x-ray properties (tx, lx and m_2500) are also examined and fitted.

astro-ph;0703570	cosmological constraints from the 100 square degree weak lensing survey	we present a cosmic shear analysis of the 100 square degree weak lensingsurvey, combining data from the cfhtls-wide, rcs, virmos-descart and gabodssurveys. spanning ~100 square degrees, with a median source redshift z~0.78,this combined survey allows us to place tight joint constraints on the matterdensity parameter omega_m, and the amplitude of the matter power spectrumsigma_8, finding sigma_8*(omega_m/0.24)^0.59 = 0.84+/-0.05. tables of themeasured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix foreach survey are included.  the accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing tothree important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmicvariance errors by including a non-gaussian contribution estimated fromnumerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias asestimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), ofeach survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currentlyavailable from the cfhtls-deep. this catalogue is randomly sampled to reproducethe magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependentn(z) parametrised using two different models. while our results are consistentfor the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraintsdepend weakly (at the 5% level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies withlow confidence photometric redshift estimates (z&gt;1.5). these high redshiftgalaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensingsignal. it will therefore be important for future weak lensing surveys toobtain near-infra-red data to reliably determine the number of high redshiftgalaxies in cosmic shear analyses.

0809.3832	the x-ray cluster normalization of the matter power spectrum	the number density of galaxy clusters provides tight statistical constraintson the matter fluctuation power spectrum normalization, traditionally phrasedin terms of sigma_8, the root mean square mass fluctuation in spheres withradius 8 h^-1 mpc. we present constraints on sigma_8 and the total matterdensity omega_m0 from local cluster counts as a function of x-ray temperature,taking care to incorporate and minimize systematic errors that plagued previouswork with this method. in particular, we present new determinations of thecluster luminosity - temperature and mass - temperature relations, includingtheir intrinsic scatter, and a determination of the jenkins mass functionparameters for the same mass definition as the mass - temperature calibration.marginalizing over the 12 uninteresting parameters associated with this method,we find that the local cluster temperature function implies sigma_8(omega_m0/0.32)^alpha = 0.86+/-0.04 with alpha = 0.30 (0.41) for omega_m0 &lt;0.32 (omega_mo &gt; 0.32) (68% confidence for two parameters). this result agreeswith a wide range of recent independent determinations, and we find no evidenceof any additional sources of systematic error for the x-ray cluster temperaturefunction determination of the matter power spectrum normalization. the jointwmap5 + cluster constraints are: omega_m0 = 0.30+0.03/-0.02 and sigma_8 =0.85+0.04/-0.02 (68% confidence for two parameters).

0810.2826	the relation between stellar mass and weak lensing signal around  galaxies: implications for mond	we study the amplitude of the weak gravitational lensing signal as a functionof stellar mass around a sample of relatively isolated galaxies. this selectionof lenses simplifies the interpretation of the observations, which consist ofdata from the red- sequence cluster survey and the sloan digital sky survey. wefind that the amplitude of the lensing signal as a function of stellar mass iswell described by a power law with a best fit slope \alpha= 0.74 \pm 0.08. thisresult is inconsistent with modified newtonian dynamics, which predicts \alpha= 0.5 (we find \alpha &gt; 0.5 with 99.7% confidence). as a related test, wedetermine the mond mass-to-light ratio as a function of luminosity. our resultsrequire dark matter for the most luminous galaxies (l &gt;=10^11 l_sun). we ruleout an extended halo of gas or active neutrinos as a way of reconciling ourfindings with mond. although we focus on a single alternative gravity model, wenote that our results provide an important test for any alternative theory ofgravity.
