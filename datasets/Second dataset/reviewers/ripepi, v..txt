0902.4230	pulsating variable stars in the coma berenices dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present b, v, i time-series photometry of the coma berenices dwarfspheroidal galaxy, a faint milky way satellite, recently discovered by thesloan digital sky survey. we have obtained v, b-v and v, v-i color-magnitudediagrams that reach v~23.0-23.2 mag showing the galaxy turnoff at v~21.7 mag,and have performed the first study of the variable star population of this newmilky way companion. two rr lyrae stars (a fundamental-mode -rrab- and a firstovertone -rrc- pulsator) and a short period variable with period p=0.12468 dayswere identified in the galaxy. the rrab star has a rather long period ofp_ab=0.66971 days and is about 0.2 mag brighter than the rrc variable and othernon-variable stars on the galaxy horizontal branch. in the period-amplitudediagram the rrab variable falls closer to the loci of oosterhoff type-iisystems and evolved fundamental-mode rr lyrae stars in the galactic globularcluster m3. the average apparent magnitude of the galaxy horizontal branch,&lt;v_hb&gt;=18.64+-0.04 mag, leads to a distance modulus for the coma dsphmu_0=18.13+-0.08 mag, corresponding to a distance d=42^{+2}_{-1} kpc, byadopting a reddening e(b-v) = 0.045 +- 0.015 mag and a metallicity [fe/h]=-2.53+- 0.05 dex.

0903.4556	multisite photometry of the pulsating herbig ae star v346 ori	context: the study of pulsation in pre--main--sequence intermediate-massstars represents an important tool for deriving information on fundamentalstellar parameters and internal structure, as well as for testing currenttheoretical models. interest in this class of variable stars has significantlyincreased during the last decade and about 30 members are presently known inthe literature. aims: we have constructed the frequency spectrum of theoscillations in v346 ori. we apply asteroseismic tools to these data toestimate the intrinsic parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature) ofv346 ori and to obtain information on its internal structure. methods: ccd timeseries photometry in the johnson v filter has been obtained for a total of145.7 h of observations distributed over 36 nights. the resulting light curveshave been subjected to a detailed frequency analysis using updated numericaltechniques. photometric and spectroscopic data have also been acquired todetermine reliable estimates of the stellar properties. results: we haveidentified 13 oscillation frequencies, 6 of which with higher significance.these have been compared with the predictions of non-radial adiabatic models.the resulting best fit model has a mass of 2.1$\pm$0.2 $m_{\odot}$, luminosity$\log{l/l_{\odot}}=1.37^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, and effective temperature7300$\pm$200 k. these values are marginally consistent with the association ofv346 ori to orion ob1a. alternatively, v346 ori could be placed at a slightlylarger distance than previously estimated.

1001.0747	hybrid gamma doradus - delta scuti pulsators: new insights into the  physics of the oscillations from kepler observations	observations of the pulsations of stars can be used to infer their interiorstructure and test theoretical models. the main sequence $\gamma$ doradus (dor)and $\delta$ scuti (sct) stars with masses 1.2-2.5 $m_{\sun}$ are particularlyuseful for these studies. the $\gamma$ dor stars pulsate in high-order $g$modes with periods of order 1 day, driven by convective blocking at the base oftheir envelope convection zone. the $\delta$ sct stars pulsate in low-order $g$and $p$ modes with periods of order 2 hours, driven by the $\kappa$ mechanismoperating in the heii ionization zone. theory predicts an overlap region in thehertzsprung-russell diagram between instability regions, where 'hybrid' starspulsating in both types of modes should exist. the two types of modes withproperties governed by different portions of the stellar interior providecomplementary model constraints. among the known $\gamma$ dor and $\delta$ sctstars, only four have been confirmed as hybrids. now, analysis of combinedquarter 0 and quarter 1 kepler data for hundreds of variable stars shows thatthe frequency spectra are so rich that there are practically no pure $\delta$sct or $\gamma$ dor pulsators, i.e. essentially all of the stars showfrequencies in both the $\delta$ sct and $\gamma$ dor frequency range. a newobservational classification scheme is proposed that takes into account theamplitude as well as the frequency, and is applied to categorize 234 stars as$\delta$ sct, $\gamma$ dor, $\delta$ sct/$\gamma$ dor or $\gamma$ dor/$\delta$sct hybrids.

1009.0435	pre-main sequence stars in the star forming complex sh 2-284	located at the galactic anticenter, sh 2-284 is a hii region which harborsseveral young open clusters; dolidze 25, a rare metal poor (z~0.004) youngcluster, is one of these. given its association with sh 2-284, it is reasonableto assume the low metallicity for the whole hii region. sh~2-284 is expected tohost a significant population of pre-main sequence (pms) stars of both low andintermediate mass stars (herbig ae stars). we aim at characterizing these starsby means of a spectroscopic and photometric survey conducted with vimos@vlt andcomplemented with additional optical and infrared observations. in this surveywe selected and characterized 23 pms objects. we derived the effectivetemperature, the spectral energy distribution and luminosity of these objects;using theoretical pms evolutionary tracks, with the appropriate metallicity, weestimated the mass and the age of the studied objects. we also estimated adistance of 4 kpc for sh 2-284 by using spectroscopic parallax of 3 ob stars.from the age determination we concluded that triggered star formation is in actin this region. our results show that a significant fraction of the youngstellar objects (ysos) may have preserved their disk/envelopes, in contrastwith what is found in other recent studies of low-metallicity star formingregions in the galaxy. finally, among the 23 bona fide pms stars, we identified8 stars which are good candidates to pulsators of the delta scuti type.

1012.4373	regularities in frequency spacings of delta scuti stars: the kepler star  kic 9700322	in the faint star kic 9700322 observed by the kepler satellite, 76frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29000 ppm were detected. the twodominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 c/d (113.3 and 145.5 \mu hz),interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number ofcombination frequencies. a small additional modulation with a 0.16 c/dfrequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of thestar. the corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrumfrom which v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. the analysis of the spectrumshows that the star is one of the coolest {\delta} sct variables. we alsodetermine teff = 6700 \pm 100 k and log g = 3.7 \pm 0.1, compatible with theobserved frequencies of the radial modes. normal solar abundances are found. an\ell = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separationconsistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. a remarkableresult is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to anamplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against mostforms of nonradial pulsation. the frequency spectrum of this star emphasizesthe need for caution in interpreting low frequencies in {\delta} sct stars asindependent gravity modes. a low frequency peak at 2.7763 c/d in kic 9700322is, in fact, the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and isrepeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the twodominant modes. the relative phases of the combination frequencies show astrong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this resultis not clear.

1012.4376	cors baade-wesselink method in the walraven photometric system: the  period-radius and the period-luminosity relation of classical cepheids	we present a new derivation of the cors baade-wesselink method in thewalraven photometric system. we solved the complete baade-wesselink equation bycalibrating the surface brightness function with a recent grid of atmospheremodels. the new approach was adopted to estimate the mean radii of a sample ofgalactic cepheids for which are available precise light curves in the walravenbands. current radii agree, within the errors, quite well with cepheid radiibased on recent optical and near-infrared interferometric measurements. we alsotested the impact of the projection factor on the period-radius relation usingtwo different values (p=1.36, p=1.27) that bracket the estimates available inthe literature. we found that the agreement of our period-radius relation withsimilar empirical and theoretical period-radius relations in the recentliterature, improves by changing the projection factor from p=1.36 to p=1.27.our period-radius relation is log(r)=(0.75\pm 0.03)log(p)+(1.10 \pm 0.03), witha rms=0.03 dex. thanks to accurate estimates of the effective temperature ofthe selected cepheids, we also derived the period-luminosity relation in the vband and we found mv=(-2.78 \pm 0.11)log(p)+(-1.42 \pm 0.11) with rms=0.13 mag,for p=1.27. it agrees quite well with recent results in the literature, whilethe relation for p=1.36 deviates by more than 2sigma. we conclude that, eventaking into account the intrinsic dispersion of the obtained period-luminosityrelations, that is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the effect of theprojection factor, the results of this paper seem to favour the value p = 1.27.

1106.0418	corot\,102699796, the first metal-poor herbig ae pulsator: a hybrid  $\delta$ sct-$\gamma$ dor variable?	we present the analysis of the time series observations of corot\,102699796obtained by the corot satellite that show the presence of five independentoscillation frequencies in the range 3.6-5 c/d. using spectra acquired withflames@vlt, we derive the following stellar parameters: spectral type f1v,t$_{\rm eff}$=7000$\pm$200 k, log(g)=$3.8\pm0.4$, [m/h]=$-1.1\pm0.2$,$v$sin$i$=$50\pm5$ km/s, l/l$_{\odot}$=21$^{+21}_{-11}$. thus, for the firsttime we report the existence of a metal poor, intermediate-mass pms pulsatingstar. ground-based and satellite data are used to derive the spectral energydistribution of corot\,102699796 extending from the optical to mid-infraredwavelengths. the sed shows a significant ir excess at wavelengths greater than$\sim5 \mu$. we conclude that corot\,102699796 is a young herbig ae (f1ve) starwith a transitional disk, likely associated to the hii region [ft96]213.1-2.2.  the pulsation frequencies have been interpreted in the light of thenon-radial pulsation theory, using the losc code in conjunction with static androtational evolutionary tracks. a minimization algorithm was used to find thebest-fit model with m=1.84 m$_{\odot}$, t$_{\rm eff}$=6900 k which imply anisochronal age of t$\sim$2.5 myr. this result is based on the interpretation ofthe detected frequencies as $g$-modes of low-moderate $n$-value. to ourknowledge, this is the first time that such modes are identified in aintermediate-mass pms pulsating star. since corot\,102699796 lies in the regionof the hr diagram where the $\delta$ sct and $\gamma$ dor instability stripsintersect, we argue that the observed pulsation characteristics areintermediate between these classes of variables, i.e. corot\,102699796 islikely the first pms hybrid $\gamma$ dor-$\delta$ sct pulsator ever studied.

(withminor transformations from the v to the kp passband) have been used to deriveunderlying physical characteristics for all the stars. this procedure seems tobe validated through comparisons of the kepler variables with galactic and lmcrr lyr stars. the most metal-poor star in the sample is nr lyr, with[fe/h]=-2.3 dex; and the four most metal-rich stars have [fe/h] ranging from-0.6 to +0.1 dex. pulsational luminosities and masses are found to besystematically smaller than l and mass values derived from stellar evolutionmodels, and are favoured over the evolutionary values when periods are computedwith the warsaw linear hydrodynamics code. finally, the fourier parameters arecompared with theoretical values derived using the warsaw non-linear convectivepulsation code.

1107.0335	the kepler characterization of the variability among a- and f-type  stars. i. general overview	the kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data withmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of a-f type stars. we present a firstgeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of a-f type stars asobserved in the kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate a-f typestars. we propose three main groups to describe the observed variety inpulsating a-f type stars: gamma dor, delta sct, and hybrid stars. we assign 63%of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part asrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectraltype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has beenobserved before. we characterize for the first time a large number of a-f typestars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,and typical pulsation amplitudes. the majority of hybrid stars show frequencieswith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma dor and delta sct range, alsobetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. we findindications for the existence of delta sct and gamma dor stars beyond the edgesof the current observational instability strips. the hybrid stars occupy theentire region within the delta sct and gamma dor instability strips, andbeyond. non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. thelocation of gamma dor and delta sct classes in the (teff,logg)-diagram has beenextended. we investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma dor and delta sctstars. our results suggest a revision of the current observational instabilitystrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplementthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.

1204.4612	the carina project. v. the impact of nlte effects on the iron content	we have performed accurate iron abundance measurements for 44 red giants(rgs) in the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. we used archival,high-resolution spectra (r~38,000) collected with uves at eso/vlt either inslit mode (5) or in fiber mode (39, flames/giraffe-uves). the sample is morethan a factor of four larger than any previous spectroscopic investigation ofstars in dsphs based on high-resolution (r&gt;38,000) spectra. we did not imposethe ionization equilibrium between neutral and singly-ionized iron lines. theeffective temperatures and the surface gravities were estimated by fittingstellar isochrones in the v, b-v color-magnitude diagram. to measure the ironabundance of individual lines we applied the lte spectrum synthesis fittingmethod using marcs model atmospheres of appropriate metallicity. we foundevidence of nlte effects between neutral and singly-ionized iron abundances.assuming that the feii abundances are minimally affected by nlte effects, wecorrected the fei stellar abundances using a linear fit between fei and feiistellar abundance determinations.  we found that the carina metallicity distribution based on the corrected feiabundances (44 rgs) has a weighted mean metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.80 and aweighted standard deviation of sigma=0.24 dex. the carina metallicitydistribution based on the feii abundances (27 rgs) gives similar estimates([fe/h]=-1.72, sigma=0.24 dex). the current weighted mean metallicities areslightly more metal poor when compared with similar estimates available in theliterature. furthermore, if we restrict our analysis to stars with the mostaccurate iron abundances, ~20 fei and at least three feii measurements (15stars), we found that the range in iron abundances covered by carina rgs (~1dex) agrees quite well with similar estimates based on high-resolution spectra.

1207.2492	the vmc survey - vi. quasars behind the magellanic system	the number and spatial distribution of confirmed quasi-stellar objects (qsos)behind the magellanic system is limited. this undermines their use asastrometric reference objects for different types of studies. we have searchedfor criteria to identify candidate qsos using observations from the vistasurvey of the magellanic clouds system (vmc) that provides photometry in theyjks bands and 12 epochs in the ks band. the (y-j) versus (j-ks) diagram hasbeen used to distinguish qso candidates from milky way stars and stars of themagellanic clouds. then, the slope of variation in the ks band has been used toidentify a sample of high confidence candidates. these criteria were developedbased on the properties of 117 known qsos presently observed by the vmc survey.vmc yjks magnitudes and ks light-curves of known qsos behind the magellanicsystem are presented. about 75% of them show a slope of variation in ks&gt;10^-4mag/day and the shape of the light-curve is in general irregular and withoutany clear periodicity. the number of qso candidates found in tiles includingthe south ecliptic pole and the 30 doradus regions is 22 and 26, respectively,with a ~20% contamination by young stellar objects, planetary nebulae, starsand normal galaxies. by extrapolating the number of qso candidates to theentire vmc survey area we expect to find about 1200 qsos behind the lmc, 400behind the smc, 200 behind the bridge and 30 behind the stream areas, but notall will be suitable for astrometry. further, the ks band light-curves can helpsupport investigations of the mechanism responsible for the variations.

1303.1017	testing different methods for atmospheric parameters determination. the  case study of the am star hd\,71297	in this paper we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the suspectedmarginal am star hd\,71297. our goal is to test the accuracy of two differentapproaches to determine the atmospheric parameters effective temperature,gravity, projected rotational velocity, and chemical abundances. the methodsused in this paper are: classical spectral synthesis and the {\it versatilewavelength analysis} ({\sl vwa}) software.  since our star is bright and very close to the sun, we were able to determineits effective temperature and gravity directly through photometric,interferometric, and parallax measurements. the values found were taken asreference to which we compare the values derived by spectroscopic methods. ouranalysis leads us to conclude that the spectroscopic methods considered in thisstudy to derive fundamental parameters give consistent results, if we considerall the sources of experimental errors, that have been discussed in the text.in addition, our study shows that the spectroscopic results are quite asaccurate as those derived from direct measurements.  as for the specific object analyzed here, according to our analysis,hd\,71297 has chemical abundances not compatible with the previous spectralclassification. we found moderate underabundances of carbon, sodium, magnesium,and iron-peak elements, while oxygen, aluminum, silicon, sulfur, and heavyelements (z $\geq$ 39) are solar in content. this chemical pattern has beenconfirmed by the calculations performed with both methods.

1304.1153	the vmc survey vii. reddening map of the 30 doradus field and the  structure of the cold interstellar medium	context: the details of how galaxies have evolved are imprinted in their starformation history, chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure.parameters behind these can be measured by combining photometric techniqueswith modelling. however, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colourand magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.  aims: in this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30doradus region of the large magellanic cloud; for community use and to test themethods used. the reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracerof the interstellar medium (ism).  methods: near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measurereddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitudevariance. the star formation history is used to convert colour to reddeningvalues which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.  results: presented is a dust map for the 30 doradus field. this map samples aregion of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddeningup to av=6 mag. we compare our map with maps from the literature, includingoptical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomichydrogen and dust emission. through estimation of column density we locatemolecular clouds.  conclusions: this new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps inthe literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. we make ourreddening map available for community use. in terms of ism the red clump starsappear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emissionbecause there is stronger correlation between increasing emission andextinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that wouldheat the dust. the transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occursbetween densities of nh=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2.

1306.4336	the vmc survey -ix. pilot study of the proper motion of stellar  populations in the lmc from 2mass and vista data	we use multi-epoch near-infrared observations from the vista survey of themagellanic cloud system (vmc) to measure the proper motion of stars of the lmc,in one tile of 1.5 deg^2 centred at (alpha, delta) = (05:59:23.136,-66:20:28.68) and including the south ecliptic pole, with respect to their2mass position over a time baseline of ~10 years and from vmc observationsonly, spanning a time range of ~1 year. stars of different ages are selectedfrom the (j-ks) vs. ks diagram and their average coordinate displacement iscomputed from the difference between ks band observations for stars as faint asks=19 mag. proper motions are derived by averaging up to seven 2mass-vmccombinations in the first case and from the slope of the best fit line amongthe seven vmc epochs in the second case. separate proper motion values areobtained for variable stars in the field. the proper motion of ~40,000 lmcstars in the tile, with respect to ~8000 background galaxies, obtained from vmcdata alone, is mu_alpha cos(delta) = +2.20+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.29 (sys) andmu_delta = +1.70+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.30 (sys) mas/yr. this value agrees withrecent ground-based determinations in a nearby field but is larger than studieswith the hst; the cause of this discrepancy may be due to additional systematicerrors in the data. the lmc proper motion is also clearly distinct from theproper motion derived for stars of the milky way. the relative proper motionbetween the foreground stars and the lmc stars is ~5 mas/yr. furthermore, wemeasure a decrease of the proper motion with increasing logarithm of stellarage for lmc stars. this study, based on just one vmc tile, shows the potentialof the 2mass-vmc and vmc-vmc combinations for a comprehensive investigation ofthe proper motion across the magellanic system.

1307.3858	the carina project. vi. the helium burning variable stars	we present new optical (bvi) time-series data for the evolved variable starsin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the quality of the data and theobserving strategy allowed us to identify 14 new variable stars. eight out ofthe 14 are rr lyrae (rrl) stars, four are anomalous cepheids (acs) and two aregeometrical variables. comparison of the period distribution for the entiresample of rrls with similar distributions in nearby dsphs and in the largemagellanic cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systemsshare similar properties. this finding is also supported by the rrldistribution in the bailey diagram. on the other hand, the period distributionand the bailey diagram of acs display significant differences among the abovestellar systems. this evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-agestellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects andstructural parameters. we use the bv period--wesenheit (pw) relation of rrlstogether with evolutionary prescriptions and find a true distance modulus of20.09+/-0.07(intrinsic)+/-0.1(statistical) mag that agrees quite well withsimilar estimates available in the literature. we identified four peculiarvariables. taking into account their position in the bailey diagram and in thebv pw relation, two of them (v14, v149) appear to be candidate acs, while two(v158, v182) might be peculiar rrls. in particular, the variable v158 has aperiod and a v-band amplitude very similar to the low-mass rrl---rrlr-02792---recently identified by pietrzynski at al.

1505.02531	on a new theoretical framework for rr lyrae stars i: the metallicity  dependence	we present new nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models ofrr lyrae stars computed assuming a constant helium-to-metal enrichment ratioand a broad range in metal abundances (z=0.0001--0.02). the stellar masses andluminosities adopted to construct the pulsation models were fixed according todetailed central he burning horizontal branch evolutionary models. thepulsation models cover a broad range in stellar luminosity and effectivetemperatures and the modal stability is investigated for both fundamental andfirst overtones. we predict the topology of the instability strip as a functionof the metal content and new analytical relations for the edges of theinstability strip in the observational plane. moreover, a new analyticalrelation to constrain the pulsation mass of double pulsators as a function ofthe period ratio and the metal content is provided. we derive newperiod-radius-metallicity relations for fundamental and first-overtonepulsators. they agree quite well with similar empirical and theoreticalrelations in the literature. from the predicted bolometric light curves,transformed into optical (ubvri) and near-infrared (jhk) bands, we compute theintensity-averaged mean magnitudes along the entire pulsation cycle and, inturn, new and homogenous metal-dependent (rijhk) period-luminosity relations.moreover, we compute new dual and triple band optical, optical--nir and nirperiod-wesenheit-metallicity relations. interestingly, we find that the opticalperiod-w(v,b-v) is independent of the metal content and that the accuracy ofindividual distances is a balance between the adopted diagnostics and theprecision of photometric and spectroscopic datasets.

1509.02687	the carina project ix: on hydrogen and helium burning variables	we present new multi-band (ubvi) time-series data of helium burning variablesin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the current sample includes 92 rrlyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 anomalous cepheids, one ofwhich is new identification. the analysis of the bailey diagram shows that theluminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variablesis located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables,while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale ofregular fundamental variables. this evidence further supports the transitionalnature of these objects. moreover, the distribution of carina double-modevariables in the petersen diagram (p_1/p_0 vs p_0) is similar to metal-poorglobulars (m15, m68), to the dwarf spheroidal draco and to the galactic halo.this suggests that the carina old stellar population is metal-poor and affectedby a small spread in metallicity. we use trigonometric parallaxes for fivefield rr lyrae stars to provide an independent estimate of the carina distanceusing the observed reddening free period--wesenheit [pw, (bv)] relation. theoryand observations indicate that this diagnostic is independent of metallicity.we found a true distance modulus of \mu=20.01\pm0.02 (standard error of themean) \pm0.05 (standard deviation) mag. we also provided independent estimatesof the carina true distance modulus using four predicted pw relations (bv, bi,vi, bvi) and we found: \mu=(20.08\pm0.007\pm0.07) mag,\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag, \mu=(20.07\pm0.008\pm0.08) mag and\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag. finally, we identified more than 100 new sxphoenicis stars that together with those already known in the literature (340)make carina a fundamental laboratory to constrain the evolutionary andpulsation properties of these transitional variables.

1509.06943	kepler observations of a-f pre-main sequence stars in upper scorpius:  discovery of six new $\delta$~scuti and one $\gamma$~doradus stars	we present light curves and periodograms for 27 stars in the young upperscorpius association (age=$11 \pm 1$\,myr) obtained with the kepler spacecraft.this association is only the second stellar grouping to host several pulsatingpre-main sequence (pms) stars which have been observed from space. from ananalysis of the periodograms, we identify six $\delta$~scuti variables and one$\gamma$~doradus star. these are most likely pms stars or else very close tothe zero-age main sequence. four of the $\delta$~scuti variables were observedin short-cadence mode, which allows us to resolve the entire frequencyspectrum. for these four stars, we are able to infer some qualitativeinformation concerning their ages. for the remaining two $\delta$~scuti stars,only long-cadence data are available, which means that some of the frequenciesare likely to be aliases. one of the stars appears to be a rotational variablein a hierarchical triple system. this is a particularly important object, as itallows the possibility of an accurate mass determination when radial velocityobservations become available. we also report on new high-resolution echellespectra obtained for some of the stars of our sample.

astro-ph;0506206	the metal abundance distribution of the oldest stellar component in the  sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	(abridged): low resolution spectroscopy obtained with fors2 at the very largetelescope (vlt) has been used to measure individual metal abundances ([fe/h])for 107 rr lyrae stars, and trace the metal distribution of the oldest stellarcomponent in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. their metallicities have anaverage value of [fe/h]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover themetallicity range -2.40&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.85 (only 1 star with [fe/h]&gt;-1). thestar-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. the radialvelocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersionderived in sculptor by tolstoy et al. (2004). this along with the metallicitydistribution, suggests that most of the rr lyr's arise from the same burst ofstellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to thegalaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrallyconcentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. the spectroscopicmetallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study theluminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09mag/dex. this result can be due to a high level of evolution off the zero agehorizontal branch of the rr lyrae stars in this galaxy, again in agreement withtheir origin from the blue horizontal branch population.

astro-ph;0508079	metal abundances of rr lyrae stars in the metal rich globular cluster  ngc 6441	low resolution spectra have been used to measure individual metal abundancesof rr lyrae stars in ngc 6441, a galactic globular cluster known to have veryunusual horizontal branch morphology and periods of the rr lyrae stars for itshigh metallicity. we find an average metal abundance of [fe/h]=-0.69 +/- 0.06(r.m.s.=0.33 dex) and [fe/h]=-0.41 +/- 0.06 (r.m.s.=0.36 dex) on zinn &amp; westand carretta &amp; gratton metallicity scales, respectively, consistent with thecluster metal abundance derived by armandroff &amp; zinn. most of the metallicitieswere extrapolated from calibration relations defined for [fe/h] &lt; -1; however,they are clearly high and contrast with the rather long periods of the ngc 6441variables, thus confirming that the cluster does not fit in the generaloosterhoff classification scheme. the r.m.s. scatter of the average is largerthan observational errors (0.15-0.16 dex) possibly indicating some spread inmetallicity. however, even the metal poor variables, if confirmed to be clustermembers, are still more metal rich than those commonly found in the oosterhofftype ii globular clusters.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0512289	a multisite photometric campaign on the pre-main-sequence delta scuti  pulsator ip per	we present the results of a photometric multisite campaign on the $\delta$scuti pre-main-sequence star ip per. nine telescopes have been involved in theobservations, with a total of about 190 hours of observations over 38 nights.present data confirms the multiperiodic nature of this star and leads to theidentification of at least nine pulsational frequencies. comparison with thepredictions of linear non-adiabatic radial pulsation models allowed us toidentify only five of the nine observed frequencies, and to constrain theposition of ip per in the hr diagram. the latter is in good agreement with theempirical determination of the stellar parameters obtained by miroshnichenko etal. (2001). an initial interpretation of the observed frequencies using theaarhus non-radial pulsation code suggests that three frequencies could beassociated with non-radial ($l$=2) modes. finally, we present new evolutionaryand pulsation models at lower metallicity (z=0.008) to take into account thepossibility that ip per is metal deficient, as indicated by miroshnichenko etal.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0610194	discovery of $\delta$ scuti pulsation in the herbig ae star vv ser	a new observational study of the herbig ae star vv ser has been performed inorder to detect and accurately measure pulsation frequencies in the $\delta$scuti range. as it belongs to the continuous field of view of theasteroseismological satellite corot, this study also aims at characterizing theproperties of vv ser as a potential ``corot additional program'' candidate. ccdtime series photometry in the johnson v filter has been obtained during threeconsecutive years. the resulting light curves have been subject to detailedfrequency analysis and the derived frequencies have been compared to modelpredictions. seven pulsation frequencies have been measured on the basis of thebest dataset obtained in 2004, ranging from $\sim$ 31 to $\sim$ 118 $\mu hz$,with an accuracy of the order of 0.5 $\mu hz$. the comparison with an extensiveset of asteroseismological models shows that all the observed periodicities canbe reproduced if the stellar mass is close to $4 m_{\odot}$. conversely, themeasured frequencies can be associated to $p$ modes only if the effectivetemperature is significantly lower than that obtained from the spectral typeconversion. the present results seem to suggest that more accurate spectraltype determination is necessary in order to discriminate the best fit modelsolution. in any case, the stellar mass of vv ser is close to the upper masslimit ($\sim 4 m_{\odot}$) for this class of pulsators.

astro-ph;0611169	the galactic halo density distribution from photometric survey data:  results of a pilot study	our goal is to recover the galactic halo spatial density by means of fieldstars. to this aim, we apply a new technique to the capodimonte deep field(oacdf, alcala' et al. 2004), as a pilot study in view of the vlt surveytelescope (vst) stellar projects. considering the unique chance to collect deepand wide-field photometry with the vst, our method may represent a useful tooltowards a definitive mapping of the galactic halo. in the framework ofsynthetic stellar populations, turn-off stars are used to reconstruct thespatial density. the determination of the space density is achieved bycomparing the data with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (cmds). the onlyassumptions involve the imf, age and metallicity of the synthetic halopopulation. stars are randomly placed in the solid angle. the contributions ofthe various monte carlo distributions (with a step of 4 kpc) along the line ofsight are simultaneously varied to reproduce the observed cmd. our result onthe space density is consistent with a power-law exponent n~3 over a range ofgalactocentric distances from 8 to 40 kpc.

astro-ph;0702110	a theoretical approach for the interpretation of pulsating pms  intermediate-mass stars	the investigation of the pulsation properties of pre-main-sequenceintermediate-mass stars is a promising tool to evaluate the intrinsicproperties of these stars and to constrain current evolutionary models. manynew candidates of this class have been discovered during the last decade andvery accurate data are expected from space observations obtained for examplewith the corot satellite. in this context we aim at developing a theoreticalapproach for the interpretation of observed frequencies, both from the alreadyavailable ground-based observations and from the future more accurate andextensive corot results. to this purpose we have started a project devoted tothe computations of fine and extensive grids of asteroseismic models ofintermediate mass pre-main-sequence stars. the obtained frequencies are used toderive an analytical relation between the large frequency separation and thestellar luminosity and effective temperature and to develop a tool to comparetheory and observations in the echelle diagram. the predictive capabilities ofthe proposed method are verified through the application to two test stars. asa second step, we apply the procedure to two true observations from multisitecampaigns and we are able to constrain their stellar parameters, in particularthe mass, in spite of the small number of frequencies. we expect that with asignificantly higher number of frequencies both the stellar mass and age couldbe constrained and, at the same time, the physics of the models could betested.

astro-ph;9911472	an investigation of the revised cors method based on theoretical models	direct measurements of cepheid radii are a key for understanding the physicalstructure of these variables, and in turn for constraining their pulsationproperties. in this paper we discuss the numerical experiments we performed fortesting the accuracy of cepheid radii obtained by adopting both the purebaade-wesselink (bw) method and the revised cors method, as well as theconsistency of the physical assumptions on which these methods are based. weapplied both the bw and the revised cors methods to the synthetic light, colorand radial velocity curves predicted by cepheid full amplitude, nonlinear,convective models at solar chemical composition. we found that these methodssystematically either underestimate or overestimate "theoretical" radii ifradius determinations are based on optical (bvr) bands or on (vjk) bands,respectively. at the same time, current simulations suggest that cors radii arein very good agreement with "theoretical" radii if the surface brightness iscalibrated by adopting a bidimensional fit of atmosphere models which accountsfor temperature, gravity, and bolometric correction variations along thepulsation cycle.
