0902.1748	interpreting the clustering of distant red galaxies	we analyze the angular clustering of z~2.3 distant red galaxies (drgs)measured by quadri et al 2008. we find that, with robust estimates of themeasurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, themeasured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, incontrast to previous results. however, in order to fit the strong break inw(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the drgluminosity range are required to be drgs. within this luminosity-thresholdsample, the fraction of galaxies that are drgs is ~44%, implying that theformation of drgs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for centralgalaxies. despite the evolved stellar populations contained within drgs atz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the drg luminosity range have been accretedwithin 500 myr. thus, satellite drgs must have known they would becomesatellites well before the time of their accretion. this implies that theformation of drgs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,although the large-scale bias of drgs can be well fit without such assumptions.further data are required to resolve this issue. using the observationalestimate that ~30% of drgs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescalefor star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 myr, although theuncertainty on this number is large. however, unless all non-star formingsatellite drgs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale issignificantly shorter than z~0 estimates. down to the completeness limit of thequadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central drgs are ~50%higher than non-drgs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halomasses the central galaxies are drgs only ~2/3 of the time.

0902.3237	the clustering of mgii absorption systems at z=0.5 and detection of cold  gas in massive halos	we measure the large-scale clustering of mgii \lambda\lambda 2796,2803absorbers with respect to a population of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at z\sim 0.5. from the cross-correlation measurements between mgii absorbers andlrgs, we calculate the mean bias of the dark matter halos in which theabsorbers reside. we investigate systematic uncertainties in the clusteringmeasurements due to the sample selection of lrgs and due to uncertainties inphotometric redshifts. first, we compare the cross-correlation amplitudesdetermined using a it flux-limited lrg sample and a volume-limited one. thecomparison shows that the relative halo bias of mgii absorbers using aflux-limited lrg sample can be overestimated by as much as \approx 20%. next,we assess the systematic uncertainty due to photometric redshift errors using amock galaxy catalog with added redshift uncertainties comparable to the data.we show that the relative clustering amplitude measured without accounting forphotometric redshift uncertainties is overestimated by \approx 10%. afteraccounting for these two main uncertainties, we find a 1-\sigmaanti-correlation between mean halo bias and absorber strength that translatesinto a 1-\sigma anti-correlation between mean galaxy mass and w_r(2796). theresults indicate that a significant fraction of the mgii absorber population ofw_r(2796)=1-1.5 \aa are found in group-size dark matter halos of log m_h &lt;13.4, whereas absorbers of w_r(2796)&gt;1.5 \aa are seen in halos of log m_h&lt;12.7. a larger dataset would improve the precision of the clusteringmeasurements and the relationship between w_r and halo mass. finally, thestrong clustering of mgii absorbers down to \sim 0.3 h^{-1} mpc indicates thepresence of cool gas inside the virial radii of the halos hosting the lrgs.

0908.3691	on the redshift evolution of mgii absorption systems	we use a halo occupation approach to connect mgii absorbers to dark matterhalos as a function of redshift. using the model constructed in tinker &amp; chen(2008), we parameterize the conditional probability of an absorber ofequivalent width wr being produced by a halo of mass m_h at a given redshift,p(wr|m_h,z). we constrain the free parameters of the model by matching theobserved statistics of mgii absorbers: the frequency function f(wr), theredshift evolution n(z), and the clustering bias b(wr). the redshift evolutionof wr&gt;1 a absorbers increases from z=0.4 to z=2, while the total halo crosssection decreases monotonically with redshift. this discrepancy can only beexplained if the gaseous halos evolve with respect to their host halos. we makepredictions for the clustering bias of absorbers as a function of redshiftunder different evolutionary scenarios, eg, the gas cross section per haloevolves or the halo mass scale of absorbers changes. we demonstrate that therelative contribution of these scenarios may be constrained by measurements ofabsorber clustering at z&gt;1 and z~0.1. if we further assume aredshift-independent mass scale for efficient shock heating of halo gas ofmcrit = 10^{11.5} msol/h, absorber evolution is predominantly caused by achanging halo mass scale of absorbers. our model predicts that strong absorbersalways arise in ~mcrit halos, independent of redshift, but the mass scale ofweak absorbers decreases by 2 dex from 0&lt;z&lt;2. thus, the measuredanti-correlation of clustering bias and wr should flatten by z~1.5.

0909.1325	what does clustering tell us about the buildup of the red sequence?	we analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanninga redshift range of 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxiesevolve onto the red sequence. the data are taken from the ukidss ultra deepsurvey, deep2, and combo-17. the use of clustering allows us to determine whatfraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellitegalaxies. at all redshifts, including z=0, the data are consistent with ~60% ofsatellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the redsequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. more than three-fourths of redsatellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted ontoa larger halo. the constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yieldsa quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the sameway as halo dynamical times; t_q ~ (1+z)^{-1.5}. in three of the four samples,the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of allcentral galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies makethe transition from star-forming to red and dead. the large errors on thefourth sample inhibit any conclusions. theoretical models in which starformation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. ascenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weakercorrelation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the mergerscenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5.these results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become redevolves from z=0.5 to z=0.

0707.3445	void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys: does halo occupation  of field galaxies depend on environment?	we use measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function w_p andgalaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixedmass is systematically different in low density environments. we present newmeasurements of the void probability function (vpf) and underdensityprobability function (upf) from data release four of the sloan digital skysurvey, as well as new measurements of the vpf from the full data release ofthe two-degree field galaxy redshift survey. we compare these measurements topredictions calculated from models of the halo occupation distribution (hod)that are constrained to match both w_p and the space density of galaxies. thestandard implementation of the hod assumes that galaxy occupation depends onhalo mass only, and is independent of local environment. for luminosity-definedsamples, we find that the standard hod prediction is a good match to theobservations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiencyis reduced in low-density environments. more remarkably, we find that the voidstatistics of red and blue galaxies (at l ~ 0.4l_*) are perfectly predicted bystandard hod models matched to the correlation function of these samples,ruling out "assembly bias" models in which galaxy color is correlated withlarge-scale environment at fixed halo mass. we conclude that the luminosity andcolor of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo inwhich they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in whichthe host halo formed. in broader terms, our results show that the sizes andemptiness of voids found in the distribution of l &gt; 0.2l_* galaxies are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model witha simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos.

1001.3162	the large scale bias of dark matter halos: numerical calibration and  model tests	we measure the clustering of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of the flat lcdm cosmology. halos areidentified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the massaround isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is deltatimes the background. we calibrate fitting functions for the large scale biasthat are adaptable to any value of delta we examine. we find a ~6% scatterabout our best fit bias relation. our fitting functions couple to the halo massfunctions of tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter isnormalized to unity. we demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos ishigher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of sheth,mo, &amp; tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapsemodel for the rarest halos. halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halosidentified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos withthe canonical delta=200 overdensity by ~10%. in contrast to our previousresults on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolvesvery weakly with redshift, if at all. we use our numerical results, both forthe mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background splitmodel for halo bias. we find that the peak-background split achieves areasonable agreement with the numerical results, but ~20% residuals remain,both at high and low masses.

1004.0705	an empirical characterization of extended cool gas around galaxies using  mgii absorption features	we report results from a survey of mgii absorbers in the spectra ofbackground qsos that are within close angular distances to a foreground galaxyat z&lt;0.5, using the magellan echellette spectrograph. we have established aspectroscopic sample of 94 galaxies at a median redshift of &lt;z&gt; = 0.24 infields around 70 distant background qsos (z_qso&gt;0.6), 71 of which are in an'isolated' environment with no known companions and located at rho &lt;~ 120 h^-1kpc from the line of sight of a background qso. the rest-frame absolute b-bandmagnitudes span a range from m_b-5log h=-16.4 to m_b-5log h=-21.4 andrest-frame b_ab-r_ab colors range from b_ab-r_ab~0 to b_ab-r_ab~1.5. of these'isolated' galaxies, we find that 47 have corresponding mgii absorbers in thespectra of background qsos and rest-frame absorption equivalent widthw_r(2796)=0.1-2.34 a, and 24 do not give rise to mgii absorption to sensitiveupper limits. our analysis shows that (1) wr(2796) declines with increasingdistance from 'isolated' galaxies but shows no clear trend in 'group'environments; (2) more luminous galaxies possess more extended mgii absorbinghalos with the gaseous radius scaled by b-band luminosity according tor_gas=75x(l_b/l_b*)^(0.35+/-0.03) h^{-1} kpc; (3) there is little dependencebetween the observed absorber strength and galaxy intrinsic colors; and (4)within r_gas, we find a mean covering fraction of &lt;kappa_0.3&gt;~70% for absorbersof wr(2796)&gt;=0.3 a and &lt;kappa_0.1&gt;~80% for absorbers of wr(2796)&gt;=0.1 a. thelack of correlation between wr(2796) and galaxy colors suggests a lack ofphysical connection between the origin of extended mgii halos and recent starformation history of the galaxies. finally, we discuss the total gas mass ingalactic halos as traced by mgii absorbers. we also compare our results withprevious studies.

1011.0735	what determines the incidence and extent of mgii absorbing gas around  galaxies?	we study the connections between on-going star formation, galaxy mass, andextended halo gas, in order to distinguish between starburst-driven outflowsand infalling clouds that produce the majority of observed mgii absorbers atlarge galactic radii (&gt;~ 10 h^{-1} kpc) and to gain insights into halo gascontents around galaxies. we present new measurements of total stellar mass(m_star), h-alpha emission line strength (ew(h-alpha)), and specific starformation rate (ssfr) for the 94 galaxies published in h.-w. chen et al.(2010). we find that the extent of mgii absorbing gas, r_mgii, scales withm_star and ssfr, following r_mgii \propto m_star^{0.28}\times ssfr^{0.11}. thestrong dependence of r_mgii on m_star is most naturally explained, if moremassive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed mgiiabsorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formationin the galaxies. the additional scaling relation of r_mgii with ssfr can beunderstood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburstoutflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos.the latter is motivated by the well-known ssfr--m_star} inverse correlation infield galaxies. our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and mgiiabsorbers along common sightlines provides an empirical characterization ofhalo gaseous radius versus halo mass. a comparison study of r_mgii around red-and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint forresolving the physical origin of the observed ssfr--m_star} relation ingalaxies.

0709.1470	on the halo occupation of dark baryons	we introduce a new technique that adopts the halo occupation framework forunderstanding the origin of qso absorption-line systems. our initial studyfocuses specifically on mgii absorbers. we construct a model of the gaseouscontent in which the absorption equivalent width w_r is determined by the theamount of cold gas, in the form of discrete clouds, along a sightline through ahalo. the two quantities that we specify per halo in the model are (1) the meanabsorption strength per unit surface mass density a_w(m), and (2) the meancovering factor kappa_g(m) of the gaseous clouds. these parameters determinethe conditional probability distribution of w_r as a function of halo mass,p(w_r|m). two empirical measurements are applied to constrain the model: (i)the absorber frequency distribution function and (ii) the w_r-dependentclustering amplitude. we find that the data demand a rapid transition in thegas content of halos at ~10^11.5 msol/h, below which halos containpredominantly cold gas and beyond which gas becomes predominantly hot. in orderto reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and theanti-correlation between w_r and halo mass m, roughly 5% of gas in halos up to10^14 msol/h is required to be cold. the gas covering factor is near unity overa wide range of halo mass, supporting that mg ii systems probe an unbiasedsample of typical galaxies. we discuss the implications of our study in thecontexts of mass assembly of distant galaxies and the origin of qso absorptionline systems.

1104.1635	cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and the mass-to-number  ratio of galaxy clusters	we place constraints on the average density (omega_m) and clusteringamplitude (sigma_8) of matter using a combination of two measurements from thesloan digital sky survey: the galaxy two-point correlation function, w_p, andthe mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, m/n, analogous tocluster m/l ratios. our w_p measurements are obtained from dr7 while the sampleof clusters is the maxbcg sample, with cluster masses derived from weakgravitational lensing. we construct non-linear galaxy bias models using thehalo occupation distribution (hod) to fit both w_p and m/n for differentcosmological parameters. hod models that match the same two-point clusteringpredict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when omega_m or sigma_8is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. wedemonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent andcompetitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, even thoughthis technique does not use abundance information. using w_p and m/n alone, wefind omega_m^0.5*sigma_8=0.465+/-0.026, with individual constraints ofomega_m=0.29+/-0.03 and sigma_8=0.85+/-0.06. combined with current cmb data,these constraints are omega_m=0.290+/-0.016 and sigma_8=0.826+/-0.020. allerrors are 1-sigma. the systematic uncertainties that the m/n technique aremost sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halosand the possibility of redshift evolution between the sdss main sample and themaxbcg sample. our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level ofuncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation ofclusters and its scatter, making the m/n technique complementary to clusterabundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1107.5311	galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: star formation rates, red  sequence fractions, and the persistent bimodality	using galaxy group/cluster catalogs created from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (ssfr)distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, hosthalo mass, and halo-centric radius. all galaxies, regardless ofcentral-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal ssfr distribution,with a strong break at ssfr ~ 10^-11 yr^-1 and the same high ssfr peak; in noregime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. satellitegalaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side ofthe ssfr distribution. furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excessabove the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. anenhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo massesdown to 3 x 10^11 msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halocenter. we find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond ~2r_viraround massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centralsand satellites. these trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significantenvironmental effects until they cross within ~r_vir of a more massive hosthalo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolvein the same manner as active central galaxies for several gyrs, and (3) oncebegun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. these results placestrong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we willdiscuss further in companion papers.

0711.0001	the varied fates of z~2 star-forming galaxies	star-forming galaxies constitute the majority of galaxies with stellar masses&gt;10^10 m_sun/h^2 at z~2 and dominate the star-formation rate density of theuniverse at this early epoch. it is thus critical to understand their origins,evolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. to thisend, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely tocontain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2sfgs) within a large dissipationlesscosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow theevolution of z2sfg descendants to z~1 and z~0. the evolved halos at theseepochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order touncover the likely descendants of z2sfgs. though the evolved halos haveclustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find thatthe bulk of z2sfgs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. thisconclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2sfgs ismuch higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting forthe merging of z2sfg descendants, which decreases the number density of z2sfgdescendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. of the ~50% of z2sfgs thatsurvive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with m&gt;10^12m_sun/h. halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos areoccupied by galaxies with m_r&lt;-20.5, implying that these z2sfgs evolve into``typical'' ~ l* galaxies today, including our own galaxy. the remaining ~30%become satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modelingsuggests that they are rather faint, with m_r&lt;-19.5.

1203.6594	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 9  spectroscopic galaxy sample	we present measurements of galaxy clustering from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii). these use the data release 9 (dr9) cmass sample, which contains264,283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effectiveredshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. assuming a concordancelambda-cdm cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2gpc^3, and represents the largest sample of the universe ever surveyed at thisdensity, n = 3 x 10^-4 h^-3 mpc^3. we measure the angle-averaged galaxycorrelation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstructionof the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features aredetected at a significance of 5\sigma in both the correlation function andpower spectrum. combining with the sdss-ii luminous red galaxy sample, thedetection significance increases to 6.7\sigma. fitting for the position of theacoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizondv /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds toa distance dv(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 mpc. at 1.7 per cent, this is the mostprecise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. we place thisresult alongside previous bao measurements in a cosmological distance ladderand find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. we usethese distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, findingcontinuing support for a flat universe with a cosmological constant.

1205.4245	the correlated formation histories of massive galaxies and their dark  matter halos	using observations in the cosmos field, we report an intriguing correlationbetween the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) centralgalaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 mpc) environments oftheir group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. probing the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an x-raydetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relationderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. at z=1,we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two lessthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. this implies that the presenceor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochasticprocess. by z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the differentgrowth rates of these objects. a similar but weaker trend is observed whendividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. remarkably, wefind that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantlymore clustered on 10 mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passivecentrals. we discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recentsimulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higherangular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halosare known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. if confirmed, thiswould be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history ofhalos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that forminside them.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1206.3571	galaxy evolution in groups and clusters: satellite star formation  histories and quenching timescales in a hierarchical universe	satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low starformation rates (sfr) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field)galaxies. using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from sdss dr7, together with acosmological n-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the starformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of m_star &gt; 5 x 10^9m_sun at z=0. we first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessingand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properlyaccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 gyrago. to obtain accurate initial conditions for the sfrs of satellites at theirtime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for theevolution of central galaxy sfrs and quiescent fractions. with this, weconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function ofsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominantprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at m_star &lt; 10^10 m_sun. we thenconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'quenching scenario: satellite sfrs evolve unaffected for 2-4 gyr after infall,after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of &lt; 0.8gyr. these quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but donot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescentfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in alower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsiblefor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. because of the longtime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellarmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. this factprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.

1207.2160	the connection between galaxies and dark matter structures in the local  universe	we provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the localuniverse, identified by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), and dark matterhalos and their constituent substructures in the $\lambda$cdm model using wmap7cosmological parameters. predictions for the abundance and clusteringproperties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hostsand substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, thebolshoi simulation. we associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhaloabundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates theunderlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property ismost closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) howmuch scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be strippedbefore their galaxies are destroyed. the models are jointly constrained by newmeasurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observedconditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. the data put tightconstraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxystellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on theunderlying conditional stellar mass function. these data rule out several haloproperties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellitefractions in the models disagree with those data. we show that an abundancematching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity oftheir halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of $0.20 \pm 0.03$dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. this will yieldimportant constraints for galaxy formation models, and also providesencouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled withsufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark universe.

1207.3794	cosmological constraints from the large scale weak lensing of sdss  maxbcg clusters	we derive constraints on the matter density \om and the amplitude of matterclustering \sig8 from measurements of large scale weak lensing (projectedseparation r=5-30\hmpc) by clusters in the sloan digital sky survey maxbcgcatalog. the weak lensing signal is proportional to the product of \om and thecluster-mass correlation function \xicm. with the relation between opticalrichness and cluster mass constrained by the observed cluster number counts,the predicted lensing signal increases with increasing \om or \sig8, with mildadditional dependence on the assumed scatter between richness and mass. thedependence of the signal on scale and richness partly breaks the degeneraciesamong these parameters. we incorporate external priors on the richness-massscatter from comparisons to x-ray data and on the shape of the matter powerspectrum from galaxy clustering, and we test our adopted model for \xicmagainst n-body simulations. using a bayesian approach with minimal restrictivepriors, we find \sig8(\om/0.325)^{0.501}=0.828 +/- 0.049, with marginalizedconstraints of \om=0.325_{-0.067}^{+0.086} and \sig8=0.828_{-0.097}^{+0.111},consistent with constraints from other maxbcg studies that use weak lensingmeasurements on small scales (r&lt;=2\hmpc). the (\om,\sig8) constraint isconsistent with and orthogonal to the one inferred from wmap cmb data,reflecting agreement with the structure growth predicted by gr for an lcdmcosmological model. a joint constraint assuming lcdm yields \om=0.298 +/- 0.020and \sig8=0.831 +/- 0.020. our cosmological parameter errors are dominated bythe statistical uncertainties of the large scale weak lensing measurements,which should shrink sharply with current and future imaging surveys.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1212.1211	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution	we measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution ofgalaxy clustering in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey ninth data release. we focus on the projected two-pointcorrelation function (2pcf) of subsets of its cmass sample, which includesabout 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43&lt;z&lt;0.7. tominimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-definedluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the cmass galaxyselection cuts. the 2pcf of the whole cmass sample, if approximated by apower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06mpc/h and an index of\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are foundfor the projected 2pcf in all redshift bins, with more luminous and reddergalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2pcf. the colordependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,consistent with the behavior of sdss-ii main sample galaxies at lowerredshifts. at a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution ofthe projected 2pcfs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. wealso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. the clustering of these galaxiesin the cmass redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted bypassive evolution. our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence andredshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of therelation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxyformation and evolution.

1303.7231	galaxy evolution near groups and clusters: ejected satellites and the  spatial extent of environmental quenching	galaxies that are several virial radii beyond groups/clusters showpreferentially quiescent star formation rates. using a galaxy group/clustercatalog from the sloan digital sky survey, together with a cosmological n-bodysimulation, we examine the origin of this environmental quenching beyond thevirial radius. accounting for the clustering of groups/clusters, we show thatcentral galaxies show enhanced sfr quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyondgroups/clusters, and we demonstrate that this extended environmentalenhancement can be explained simply by 'ejected' satellite galaxies that orbitbeyond their host halo's virial radius. we show that ejected satellitestypically orbit for several gyr beyond the virial radius before falling backin, and thus they compose up to 40% of all central galaxies neargroups/clusters. we show that a model in which ejected satellites experiencethe same sfr quenching as satellites within a host halo can explain essentiallyall environmental dependence of galaxy quenching. furthermore, ejectedsatellites (continue to) lose significant halo mass, an effect that ispotentially observable via gravitational lensing. the sfrs/colors andstellar-to-halo masses of ejected satellites highlight the importance ofenvironmental history and present challenges to models of galaxy occupationthat ignore such history.

1306.3990	stellar mass-gap as a probe of halo assembly history and concentration:  youth hidden among old fossils	we investigate the use of the halo mass-gap statistic --- defined as thelogarithmic difference in mass between the host halo and its most massivesatellite subhalo --- as a probe of halo age and concentration. a cosmologicaln-body simulation is used to study n ~25, 000 group/cluster sized halos in themass range 10^12.5 &lt; m_halo/m_sol &lt; 10^14.5. in agreement with previous work,we find that halo mass-gap is related to halo formation time and concentration.on average, older and more highly concentrated halos have larger halomass-gaps, and this trend is stronger than the mass-concentration relation overa similar dynamic range. however, there is a large amount of scatter owing tothe transitory nature of the satellite subhalo population, which limits the useof the halo mass-gap statistic on an object-by-object basis. for example, wefind that 20% of very large halo mass-gap systems (akin to "fossil groups") areyoung, and have likely experienced a recent merger between a massive satellitesubhalo and the central subhalo. we relate halo mass-gap to the observablestellar mass-gap via abundance matching. using a galaxy group catalogconstructed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7, we find that thestar formation and structural properties of galaxies at fixed mass show notrend with stellar mass-gap. this is despite a variation in halo-age of ~2.5gyr over ~1.2 dex in stellar mass-gap. thus, we find no evidence to suggestthat the halo formation history significantly affects galaxy properties.

1308.2974	evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter relation: separating  star-forming and passive galaxies from z=1 to 0	we use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, andgalaxy-galaxy lensing within the cosmos survey to constrain the stellar-to-halomass relation (shmr) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0]. for massive galaxies, m*&gt;~10^10.6 msol, our results indicatethat star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matterhalos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. at lowermasses, there is minimal difference in the shmrs, implying that the majoritylow-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their starformation. our analysis also affords a breakdown of all cosmos galaxies intothe relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. atz=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellarmass function. but the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshiftevolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass centralgalaxies being quenched of their star formation. at m*~10^10 msol, the fractionof central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over ourredshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at thatmass is constant with redshift. we define a "migration rate" to the redsequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. we find thatthe migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearlyan order of magnitude from z=1 to z=0. these results imply that the efficiencyof quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, whilethe mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groupsand clusters is losing efficiency.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1312.4996	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: analysis of potential  systematics in fitting of baryon acoustic feature	extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) to percent levelaccuracy is challenging and demands an understanding of many potentialsystematic to an accuracy well below 1 per cent, in order ensure that they donot combine significantly when compared to statistical error of the baomeasurement. sloan digital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) sdss data release eleven (dr11) reaches a distancemeasurement with $\sim 1\%$ statistical error and this prompts an extensivesearch for all possible sub-percent level systematic errors which could besafely ignored previously. in this paper, we analyze the potential systematicsin bao fitting methodology using mocks and data from boss dr10 and dr11. wedemonstrate the robustness of the fiducial multipole fitting methodology to beat $0.1\%-0.2\%$ level with a wide range of tests in mock galaxy catalogs pre-and post-reconstruction. we also find the dr10 and dr11 data from boss to berobust against changes in methodology at similar level. this systematic errorbudget is incorporated into the the error budget of baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) dr10 and dr11 bao measurements. of the wide rangeof changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting pre-reconstructeddata or mocks, the following changes have the largest effect on the best fitvalues of distance measurements both parallel and perpendicular to the line ofsight: (a) changes in non-linear correlation function template; (b) changes infitting range of the correlation function; (c) changes to the non-lineardamping model parameters. the priors applied do not matter in the estimates ofthe fitted errors as long as we restrict ourselves to physically meaningfulfitting regions.[abridged]

1401.3009	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: modeling of the luminosity and colour dependence in the  data release 10	we investigate the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering of cmassgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey tenth data release. the halo occupation distribution framework isadopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements onsmall and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) and tointerpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to darkmatter halos. we find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos ofmass $m{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$ and more luminousgalaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. the strongsmall-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellitesin massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent anddecreasing with luminosity. the characteristic mass of a halo hosting onaverage one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the samethreshold. at a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are morestrongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a largerfraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. ourclustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$ allow us tostudy the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. whilethe clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by anavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers asteeper or more concentrated profile. finally, we also use galaxy samples ofconstant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution ofluminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passiveevolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

1403.4599	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: signs of neutrino mass in current cosmological datasets	we investigate the cosmological implications of the latest growth ofstructure measurement from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)cmass data release 11 with particular focus on the sum of the neutrino masses,$\sum m_{\nu}$. we examine the robustness of the cosmological constraints fromthe baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale, the alcock-paczynski effect andredshift-space distortions ($d_v/r_s$, $f_{\rm ap}$, $f\sigma_8$) of\citet{beutler:2013b}, when introducing a neutrino mass in the power spectrumtemplate. we then discuss how the neutrino mass relaxes discrepancies betweenthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) and other low-redshift measurementswithin $\lambda$cdm. combining our cosmological constraints with wmap9 yields$\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), which represents a $2.6\sigma$preference for non-zero neutrino mass. the significance can be increased to$3.3\sigma$ when including weak lensing results and other bao constraints,yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.). however, combiningcmass with planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to $\sim2\sigma$. when removing the cmb lensing effect in the planck temperature powerspectrum (by marginalising over $a_{\rm l}$), we see shifts of $\sim 1\sigma$in $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$, which have a significant effect on the neutrinomass constraints. in case of cmass plus planck without the $a_{\rm l}$-lensingsignal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), in excellent agreement with the wmap9+cmass value. theconstraint can be tightened to $3.4\sigma$ yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.) when weak lensing data and other bao constraints areincluded.

1404.3742	a 2.5% measurement of the growth rate from small-scale redshift space  clustering of sdss-iii cmass galaxies	we perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of sdss-iii cmass dr10galaxies on scales of ~ 0.8 - 32 mpc/h. a standard halo occupation distributionmodel evaluated near the best fit planck lcdm cosmology provides a good fit tothe observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for thepeculiar velocity field of m ~ 2 x 10^13 msun/h halos of f*sigma8(z=0.57) =0.450 +/- 0.011. since this constraint includes both quasi-linear andnon-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models thatenhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. though model dependent, ourmeasurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over theanalysis of dr11 on large scales, f*sigma8(z=0.57) = 0.447 +/- 0.028, and isthe tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date.our measurement is consistent with the planck lcdm prediction of 0.480 +/-0.010 at the ~1.9 sigma level. assuming a halo mass function evaluated at thebest fit planck cosmology, we also find that 10% of cmass galaxies aresatellites in halos of mass m ~ 6 x 10^13 msun/h. while none of our tests andmodel generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficientlydetailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these firstresults warrant further investigation into the modeling uncertainties anddegeneracies with cosmological parameters.

1407.4811	velocity bias from the small scale clustering of sdss-iii boss galaxies	we present the measurements and modelling of the projected and redshift-spaceclustering of cmass galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey data release 11. for a volume-limited luminousred galaxy sample in the redshift range of $0.48&lt;z&lt;0.55$, we perform halooccupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale($0.1$--$60h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) projected and redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions, with an accurate model built on high resolution $n$-bodysimulations. to interpret the measured redshift-space distortions, thedistribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matterinside haloes of $\sim 10^{13}$--$10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}}$, i.e. the datarequire the existence of galaxy velocity bias. most notably, central galaxieson average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes(defined by the inner 25% of particles around the halo potential minimum), butrather move around it with a 1d velocity dispersion of $0.22^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at thelevel of $\lesssim$1% of the halo virial radius. the luminous satellitegalaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities$0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ times those of the dark matter, which suggests that thevelocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased.the constraints mainly arise from the fingers-of-god effect at nonlinear scalesand the smoothing to the kaiser effect in the translinear regime; therobustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. in addition,no clear evidence is found for a strong luminosity dependence of the velocitybias. we discuss the implications of the existence of galaxy velocity bias forinvestigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.

1408.5435	tests of redshift-space distortions models in configuration space for  the analysis of the boss final data release	observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveysoffer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmologicalstructure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the universe and ourtheory of gravity. in preparation for analysis of redshift-space distortionsfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) final data release wecompare a number of analytic and phenomenological `streaming' models, specifiedin configuration space, to mock catalogs derived in different ways from severaln-body simulations. the galaxies in each mock catalog have properties similarto those of the higher redshift galaxies measured by boss but differ in thedetails of how small-scale velocities and halo occupancy are determined. wefind that all of the analytic models fit the simulations over a limited rangeof scales while failing at small scales. we discuss which models are mostrobust and on which scales they return reliable estimates of the rate of growthof structure: we find that models based on some form of resummation can fit ourn-body data for boss-like galaxies above $30\,h^{-1}$mpc well enough to returnunbiased parameter estimates.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

0804.2475	the void phenomenon explained	we use high-resolution n-body simulations, combined with a halo occupationmodel of galaxy bias, to investigate voids in the galaxy distribution. our goalis to address the 'void phenomenon' of peebles (2001), which presents theobserved dearth of faint galaxies in voids as a challenge to the currentcosmology. in our model, galaxy luminosity is determined only as a function ofdark matter halo mass. with this simple assumption, we demonstrate that large,empty voids of ~15 mpc/h in diameter are expected even for galaxies sevenmagnitudes fainter than l*. the predictions of our model are in excellentagreement with several statistical measures; (i) the luminosity function ofgalaxies in underdense regions, (ii) nearest neighbor statistics of dwarfgalaxies, (iii) the void probability function of faint galaxies. in thetransition between filaments and voids in the dark matter, the halo massfunction changes abruptly, causing the maximum galaxy luminosity to decrease by~5 magnitudes over a range of ~1 mpc/h. thus the boundary between filaments andvoids in the galaxy distribution is nearly as sharp for dwarfs as for ~l*objects. these results support a picture in which galaxy formation is drivenpredominantly by the mass of the host dark matter halo, and is nearlyindependent of the larger-scale halo environment. further, they demonstratethat lcdm, combined with a straightforward bias model, naturally explains theexistence of the void phenomenon.

astro-ph;0202358	do distinct cosmological models predict degenerate halo populations?	using cosmological n-body simulations, we investigate the influence of thematter density parameter omega_m and the linear theory power spectrum p(k) onstatistical properties of the dark matter halo population -- the mass functionn(m), the halo correlation function, and halo pairwise velocity statistics. forfixed p(k), the effect of changing omega_m is simple: the halo mass scale m_*shifts in proportion to omega_m, pairwise velocities (at fixed m/m_*) areproportional to omega_m^{0.6}, and halo clustering at fixed m/m_* is unchanged.if one simultaneously changes the p(k) amplitude sigma_8 to maintain a "clusternormalization" condition sigma_8 x omega_m^{0.5} = const, then n(m) staysapproximately constant near m ~ 5e14 msun, and halo clustering and pairwisevelocities are similar at fixed m. however, the shape of n(m) changes, with adecrease of omega_m from 0.3 to 0.2 producing a ~30% drop in the number of lowmass halos. one can preserve the shape of n(m) over a large dynamic range bychanging the shape of p(k), but the required changes are substantial, and theysignificantly alter the halo clustering and halo velocities. the sensitivity ofthe dark halo population to cosmological model parameters has encouragingimplications for efforts to constrain cosmology and galaxy bias with observedgalaxy clustering, since the predicted changes in the halo population cannoteasily be masked by altering the way that galaxies occupy halos. a shift inomega_m alone would be detected by any dynamically sensitive clusteringstatistic; a cluster normalized change to sigma_8 and omega_m would require achange in galaxy occupation as a function of m/m_*, which would alter galaxyclustering; and a simultaneous change to p(k) that preserves the halo massfunction would change the clustering of the halos themselves.

astro-ph;0209165	the influence of triaxial halos on collisionless galactic disks	we investigate the effect of rotating, triaxial halos on disk galaxiesthrough an extensive set of numerical n-body simulations. our simulations use arigid potential field for the halos and bulges and collisionless particles forthe disks. the triaxiality and the rotation rate of the halo are varied, aswell as the masses of all three galaxy components. we analyze both the barstability and spiral response of the disk under these conditions.  we characterize most of our models by the mass ratio of the disk to the haloat 2.3 disk scale lengths, (m_d/m_h)_rsun. for models with a mass ratio greaterthan 0.8, a halo pattern speed omega_h = 6.7 km/s/kpc, and anintermediate-to-major axis ratio q_b=0.85, a strong bar will develop within 3gyr, even for models with a bulge mass m_b=0.3m_d. models in which the bulgemass is reduced by half develop bars earlier and with lower omega_h.  we create an artificial hubble sequence of galaxies by varying thebulge-to-disk ratio of our models from 0 to 2.5. the torque induced by arotating, non-axisymmetric halo creates bisymmetric spiral structure in thedisk. we find the the pitch angle of the spiral arms in these models followsthe same general trend found in observations of spiral galaxies, namely thatlater type galaxies have higher pitch angles. our simulations follow closelythe observational relation of spiral pitch angle with maximum rotationalvelocity of the disk, where galaxies with faster rotation have more tightlywound spiral arms. this relation is followed in our simulations regardless ofwhether the dominating mass component of the galaxy is the disk, the halo, orthe bulge.

0808.2988	extending recovery of the primordial matter power spectrum	the shape of the primordial matter power spectrum plin(k) encodes criticalinformation on cosmological parameters. at large scales, the observable galaxypower spectrum pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of plin(k), but onsmaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratiopobs(k)/plin(k) scale-dependent. we develop a method that can extend thedynamic range of the plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on thegalaxy halo occupation distribution (hod) from the projected galaxy correlationfunction wp. we devise an analytic model to calculate pobs(k) in real-space andredshift-space. once hod parameters are determined by matching wp for a givencosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic modelpredicts both the shape and normalization of pobs(k). applying our method tosdss main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space pobs(k) follows the shapeof the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/mpc.when we apply our method to sdss lrg samples, the linear bias approximation isaccurate to 5% at k&lt;0.08 h/mpc, but the scale-dependence of lrg bias preventsthe use of linear theory at k&gt;0.08 h/mpc. our hod model prediction is in goodagreement with the recent sdss lrg pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales(k&lt;0.2 h/mpc), naturally explaining the shape of pobs(k). the "q-model"prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the lrg samples, and itcan lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k&gt;0.1h/mpc are included in the analysis. we quantify the potential bias andconstraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theoryand q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of hod modeling of futurehigh precision measurements of pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales.

astro-ph;0501029	redshift-space distortions with the halo occupation distribution i:  numerical simulations	we show how redshift-space distortions of the galaxy correlation function orpower spectrum can constrain the matter density parameter omega_m and thelinear matter fluctuation amplitude sigma_8. we improve on previous treatmentsby adopting a fully non-linear description of galaxy clustering and bias, whichallows us to break parameter degeneracies by combining large-scale and small-scale distortions. we consider different combinations of omega_m and sigma_8and find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (hod) that yieldnearly identical galaxy correlation functions in real space. we use these hodparameters to populate the dark matter halos of large n-body simulations, fromwhich we measure redshift-space distortions on small and large scales. weinclude a velocity bias parameter alpha_v that allows the velocity dispersionsof satellite galaxies in halos to be systematically higher or lower than thoseof dark matter. large-scale distortions are determined by the parametercombination beta = omega_m^{0.6}/b_g, where b_g is the galaxy bias, inagreement with linear theory. however, linear theory does not accuratelydescribe the distortions themselves on scales accessible to our simulations. weprovide fitting formulas to estimate beta from the redshift-space correlationfunction or power spectrum, and we show that these formulas are significantlymore accurate than those in the existing literature. on small scales, the``finger-of-god'' distortions at projected separations ~0.1 mpc/h depend onomega_m*alpha_v^2 but are independent of sigma_8, while at intermediateseparations they depend on sigma_8 as well. one can thus use redshift-spacedistortions over a wide range of scales to separately determine omega_m,sigma_8, and alpha_v.

astro-ph;0511580	from galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmological parameters	galaxy-galaxy lensing measures the mean excess surface density ds(r) around asample of lensing galaxies. we develop a method for combining ds(r) with thegalaxy correlation function xi_gg(r) to constrain omega_m and sigma_8, goingbeyond the linear bias model to reach the level of accuracy demanded by currentand future measurements. we adopt the halo occupation distribution (hod)framework, and we test its applicability to this problem by examining theeffects of replacing satellite galaxies in the halos of an sph simulation withrandomly selected dark matter particles from the same halos. the differencebetween dark matter and satellite galaxy radial profiles has a ~10% effect onds(r) at r&lt;1 mpc/h. however, if radial profiles are matched, the remainingimpact of individual subhalos around satellite galaxies and environmentaldependence of the hod at fixed halo mass is &lt;5% in ds(r) for 0.1&lt;r&lt;15 mpc/h. wedevelop an analytic approximation for ds(r) that incorporates halo exclusionand scale-dependent halo bias, and we demonstrate its accuracy with testsagainst a suite of populated n-body simulations. we use the analytic model toinvestigate the dependence of ds(r) and the galaxy-matter correlation functionxi_gm(r) on omega_m and sigma_8, once hod parameters for a given cosmologicalmodel are pinned down by matching xi_gg(r). the linear bias prediction isaccurate for r&gt;2 mpc/h, but it fails at the 30-50% level on smaller scales. thescaling of ds(r) ~ omega_m^a(r) sigma_8^b(r) approaches the linear biasexpectation a=b=1 at r&gt;10 mpc/h, but a(r) and b(r) vary from 0.8 to 1.6 atsmaller r. we calculate a fiducial ds(r) and scaling indices a(r) and b(r) fortwo sdss galaxy samples; galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements for these samplescan be combined with our predictions to constrain omega_m and sigma_8.

astro-ph;0603146	cosmic voids and galaxy bias in the halo occupation framework	(abridged) we investigate the power of void statistics to constrain galaxybias and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations. we use the halo occupationdistribution (hod) framework to describe the relation between galaxies and darkmatter. after choosing hod parameters that reproduce the mean space densityn_gal and projected correlation function w_p measured for galaxy samples withm_r&lt;-19 and m_r&lt;-21 from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we predict thevoid probability function (vpf) and underdensity probability function (upf) ofthese samples by populating the halos of a large, high-resolution n-bodysimulation. if we make the conventional assumption that the hod is independentof large scale environment at fixed halo mass, then models constrained to matchn_gal and w_p predict nearly identical void statistics, independent of thescatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or uncertainties in hodparameters. models with sigma_8=0.7 and sigma_8=0.9 also predict very similarvoid statistics. however, the vpf and upf are sensitive to environmentalvariations of the hod in a regime where these variations have little impact onw_p. for example, doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with largescale (5 mpc/h) density contrast delta&lt;-0.65 has a readily detectable impact onvoid probabilities of m_r&lt;-19 galaxies, and a similar change for delta&lt;-0.2alters the void probabilities of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies at a detectable level. thevpf and upf provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude ofdensity- dependence in the hod. by detecting or ruling out hod changes in lowdensity regions, void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in thecosmological constraints derived from hod modeling, and, more importantly,reveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties.

astro-ph;0603543	on the luminosity dependence of the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion	(abridged) we make predictions for the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd) ofgalaxies with models that are constrained to match the projected correlationfunction and luminosity function of galaxies in the two-degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). we use these data to constrain the halo occupationdistribution (hod), then calculate the pvd by populating the halos of a highresolution n-body simulation. we examine the luminosity and scale dependence ofthe predicted pvd. at r&lt;1 mpc/h and r&gt;3 mpc/h, we find that the pvd decreaseswith increasing galaxy luminosity. this result is mostly driven by the fractionof satellite galaxies f_sat, which is well-constrained by the correlationfunction. we find f_sat~25% for galaxies fainter than l_star, while forbrighter galaxies the satellite fraction rapidly declines, creating thedecrease in the pvd with luminosity. at r=1 mpc/h, the pvd has no dependence onluminosity because satellite galaxies dominate the statistics for all objects.recent measurements of the pvd in fourier space using the "dispersion model"have reported a strong decline in pvd with increasing luminosity at k=1 h/mpc.we test this method with our hod models, finding that there is no consistentcomparison between the pvd at a given k and the true dispersion at a givenvalue of r. this results in a luminosity dependence in k-space that is strongerthan in configuration space. the luminosity dependence of the hod results infourier space are consistent with those measured at k=1 h/mpc; thus the recentmeasurements of the pvd are fully explainable in the context of halo occupationmodels. the normalization of the pvd is lower than predicted by our fiducialmodel, and reproducing it requires a lower value of omega_m (~0.2 instead of0.3), a lower value of sigma_8 (~0.7 instead of 0.9), or strong velocity bias.

astro-ph;0604217	redshift-space distortions with the halo occupation distribution ii:  analytic model	we present an analytic model for the galaxy two-point correlation function inredshift space. the model is constructed within the framework of the halooccupation distribution (hod), which quantifies galaxy bias on linear and non-linear scales. we model one-halo pairwise velocities by assuming that satellitegalaxy velocities follow a gaussian distribution with dispersion proportionalto the virial dispersion of the host halo. two-halo velocity statistics are acombination of virial motions and host halo motions. the velocity distributionfunction (df) of halo pairs is a complex function with skewness and kurtosisthat vary substantially with scale. using a series of collisionless n-bodysimulations, we demonstrate that the shape of this df is determined primarilyby the distribution of local densities around a halo pair, and at fixed densitythe velocity df is close to gaussian and nearly independent of halo mass. wecalibrate a model for the conditional probability function of densities aroundhalo pairs on these simulations. with this model, the full shape of the halovelocity df can be accurately calculated as a function of halo mass, radialseparation, angle, and cosmology. the hod approach to redshift-spacedistortions utilizes clustering data from linear to non-linear scales to breakthe standard degeneracies inherent in previous models of redshift-spaceclustering. the parameters of the occupation function are well constrained byreal-space clustering alone, separating constraints on bias and cosmology. wedemonstrate the ability of the model to separately constrain omega_m, sigma_8,and galaxy velocity bias in models that are constructed to have the same valueof beta at large scales as well as the same finger-of-god distortions at smallscales.
