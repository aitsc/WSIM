0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.2003	a faint type of supernova from a white dwarf with a helium-rich  companion	supernovae (sne) are thought to arise from two different physical processes.the cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse andtypically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. these are thought toappear as as type ib/c and ii sne, and are associated with young stellarpopulations. a type ia sn is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonationof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose massapproaches the chandrasekhar limit. such sne are observed in both young and oldstellar environments. here we report our discovery of the faint type ib sn2005e in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, ngc 1032.  the lack of any trace of recent star formation near the sn location (fig. 1),and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 m_sun), argue strongly against acore-collapse origin for this event. spectroscopic observations and the derivednucleosynthetic output show that the sn ejecta have high velocities and aredominated by helium-burning products, indicating that sn 2005e was neither asubluminous nor a regular sn ia (fig. 2). we have therefore found a new type ofstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likelyinvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. thesn ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of sn and likelyadditional large amounts of radioactive 44ti. such sne may thus help resolvefundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitivesolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the galactic production ofpositrons.

0906.5350	the palomar transient factory: system overview, performance and first  results	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a fully-automated, wide-field surveyaimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. the transientsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the48-inch samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory; colors and light curvesfor detected transients are obtained with the automated palomar 60-inchtelescope. ptf uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-mtelescope time. with an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth ofapproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in r (5 sigma, median seeing). four majorexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernovasearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in orion; and 4) a3-pi sr deep h-alpha survey. ptf provides automatic, realtime transientclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every sourcedetected in each frame. this paper summarizes the ptf project, includingseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, theobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. we conclude by detailing thefirst 51 ptf optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

0908.0940	discovery of the very red near-infrared and optical afterglow of the  short-duration grb 070724a	[abridged] we report the discovery of the near-infrared and optical afterglowof the short-duration gamma-ray burst grb070724a. the afterglow is detected ini,j,h,k observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with k=19.59+/-0.16 magand i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.fading is also detected in the k-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigmasignificance level. the optical/near-ir spectral index, beta_{o,nir}=-2, ismuch redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to eithersignificant dust extinction, a_{v,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin forthe near-ir emission. the case for extinction is supported by a shallow opticalto x-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',and a normal near-ir to x-ray spectral index. moreover, a comparison to theoptical discovery magnitudes of all short grbs with optical afterglowsindicates that the near-ir counterpart of grb070724a is one of the brightest todate, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. in thecontext of a non-afterglow origin, the near-ir emission may be dominated by amini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of m~10^-4 msun and aradioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). however, themini-sn model predicts a spectral peak in the uv rather than near-ir,suggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that themini-sn models need to be revised. finally, the afterglow coincides with a starforming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on itscoincidence with the x-ray afterglow position (~2" radius). our discovery ofthe optical/near-ir afterglow makes this association secure.

0910.0059	hydrogen-poor superluminous stellar explosions	supernovae (sne) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational orthermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeksor more. in all known sne, this radiation comes from internal energy depositedin the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesizedelements (typically 56ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in theenvelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the sn debris andslowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. here we report on a newclass of luminous sne whose observed properties cannot be explained by any ofthese known processes. these include four new sne we have discovered, and twopreviously unexplained events (sn 2005ap; scp 06f6) that we can now identify asmembers. these sne are all ~10 times brighter than sne ia, do not show anytrace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (uv) flux for extended periodsof time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent withradioactivity. our data require that the observed radiation is emitted byhydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) andexpanding at high velocities (&gt;10^4 km s^-1). these long-lived, uv-luminousevents can be observed out to redshifts z&gt;4 and offer an excellent opportunityto study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distantgalaxies.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

1001.1156	supernova 2007bi as a pair-instability explosion	stars with initial masses 10 m_{solar} &lt; m_{initial} &lt; 100 m_{solar} fuseprogressively heavier elements in their centres, up to inert iron. the corethen gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to anexplosion -- an iron-core-collapse supernova (sn). in contrast, extremelymassive stars (m_{initial} &gt; 140 m_{solar}), if such exist, have oxygen coreswhich exceed m_{core} = 50 m_{solar}. there, high temperatures are reached atrelatively low densities. conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photonsinto electron-positron pairs occurs prior to oxygen ignition, and leads to aviolent contraction that triggers a catastrophic nuclear explosion. tremendousenergies (&gt;~ 10^{52} erg) are released, completely unbinding the star in apair-instability sn (pisn), with no compact remnant. transitional objects with100 m_{solar} &lt; m_{initial} &lt; 140 m_{solar}, which end up as iron-core-collapsesupernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps due to short instances ofthe pair instability, may have been identified. however, genuine pisne, perhapscommon in the early universe, have not been observed to date. here, we presentour discovery of sn 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving supernova locatedwithin a dwarf galaxy (~1% the size of the milky way). we measure the explodingcore mass to be likely ~100 m_{solar}, in which case theory unambiguouslypredicts a pisn outcome. we show that &gt;3 m_{solar} of radioactive 56ni weresynthesized, and that our observations are well fit by pisn models. a pisnexplosion in the local universe indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probablyhost extremely massive stars, above the apparent galactic limit, perhapsresulting from star formation processes similar to those that created the firststars in the universe.

1003.1720	discovery of a new photometric sub-class of faint and fast classical  novae	we present photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of a sample ofextragalactic novae discovered by the palomar 60-inch telescope during a searchfor "fast transients in nearest galaxies" (p60-fasting). designed as a fastcadence (1-day) and deep (g &lt; 21 mag) survey, p60-fasting was particularlysensitive to short-lived and faint optical transients. the p60-fasting novasample includes 10 novae in m31, 6 in m81, 3 in m82, 1 in ngc2403 and 1 inngc891. this significantly expands the known sample of extragalactic novaebeyond the local group, including the first discoveries in a starburstenvironment. surprisingly, our photometry shows that this sample is quiteinconsistent with the canonical maximum magnitude rate of decline (mmrd)relation for classical novae. furthermore, the spectra of the p60-fastingsample are indistinguishable from classical novae. we suggest that we haveuncovered a sub-class of faint and fast classical novae in a new phase space inluminosity-timescale of optical transients. thus, novae span two orders ofmagnitude in both luminosity and time. perhaps, the mmrd, which ischaracterized only by the white dwarf mass, was an over-simplification. novaphysics appears to be characterized by quite a rich four-dimensional parameterspace in white dwarf mass, temperature, composition and accretion rate.

1004.2900	afterglow observations of fermi-lat gamma-ray bursts and the emerging  class of hyper-energetic events	we present broadband (radio, optical, and x-ray) light curves and spectra ofthe afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 090323, 090328,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. with its wide spectralbandpass, extending to gev energies, fermi is sensitive to grbs with very largeisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). although rare, these events areparticularly important for testing grb central-engine models. when combinedwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are ableto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburstmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of theoutflows. in agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativisticenergy budget of at least one of these events (grb 090926a) exceeds thecanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. such energies pose asevere challenge for models in which the grb is powered by a magnetar orneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectationsfor magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd) collapsar models. our jet opening angles(theta) are similar to those found for pre-fermi grbs, but the large initiallorentz factors (gamma_0) inferred from the detection of gev photons implytheta gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in mhd models ofjet acceleration. finally, we find that these fermi-lat events preferentiallyoccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that thismight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicityprogenitor stars. future studies of fermi-lat afterglows in the radio with theorder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the evla shoulddefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

1103.1797	the subluminous and peculiar type ia supernova ptf09dav	ptf09dav is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn) discovered by thepalomar transient factory (ptf). spectroscopically, it appears superficiallysimilar to the class of subluminous sn1991bg-like sne, but it has severalunusual features which make it stand out from this population. its peakluminosity is fainter than any previously discovered sn1991bg-like sn ia (m_b-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faintluminosity were due to extinction. the photospheric optical spectra have veryunusual strong lines of sc ii and mg i, with possible sr ii, together withstronger than average ti ii and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. the host galaxyof ptf09dav is ambiguous. the sn lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (m_r&gt;-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other1991bg-like sne which are invariably associated with massive, old stellarpopulations. ptf09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosityand color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous sne ia. theinferred 56ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003msun), as is the estimated ejectamass of 0.36msun. taken together, these properties make ptf09dav a remarkableevent. we discuss various physical models that could explain ptf09dav. heliumshell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a co white-dwarf can explainsome of the features of ptf09dav, including the presence of sc and the lowphotospheric velocities, but the observed si and mg are not predicted to bevery abundant in these models. we conclude that no single model is currentlycapable of explaining all of the observed signatures of ptf09dav.

1106.5491	automating discovery and classification of transients and variable stars  in the synoptic survey era	the rate of image acquisition in modern synoptic imaging surveys has alreadybegun to outpace the feasibility of keeping astronomers in the real-timediscovery and classification loop. here we present the inner workings of aframework, based on machine-learning algorithms, that captures expert trainingand ground-truth knowledge about the variable and transient sky to automate 1)the process of discovery on image differences and, 2) the generation ofpreliminary science-type classifications of discovered sources. since follow-upresources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients areprecious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched interms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. weestimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epochimage-difference discovery algorithm for the palomar transient factory (ptf)survey. once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classificationtrained on ptf data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars witha 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the sloandigital sky survey footprint). at &gt;96% classification efficiency, the samplesachieve 90% purity. initial classifications are shown to rely primarily oncontext-based features, determined from the data itself and external archivaldatabases. in the ~one year since autonomous operations, this discovery andclassification framework has led to several significant science results, fromoutbursting young stars to subluminous type iip supernovae to candidate tidaldisruption events. we discuss future directions of this approach, including thepossible roles of crowdsourcing and the scalability of machine learning tofuture surveys such a the large synoptical survey telescope (lsst).

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

0710.3192	the environment of m85 optical transient 2006-1: constraints on the  progenitor age and mass	m85 optical transient 2006-1 (m85 ot 2006-1) is the most luminous member ofthe small family of v838 mon-like objects, whose nature is still a mystery.this event took place in the virgo cluster of galaxies and peaked at anabsolute magnitude of i~-13. here we present hubble space telescope images ofm85 ot 2006-1 and its environment, taken before and after the eruption, alongwith a spectrum of the host galaxy at the transient location. we find that theprogenitor of m85 ot 2006-1 was not associated with any star forming region.the g and z-band absolute magnitudes of the progenitor were fainter than about-4 and -6 mag, respectively. therefore, we can set a lower limit of ~50 myr onthe age of the youngest stars at the location of the progenitor thatcorresponds to a mass of &lt;7 solar mass. previously published line indicessuggest that m85 has a mean stellar age of 1.6+/-0.3 gyr. if this mean age isrepresentative of the progenitor of m85 ot 2006-1, then we can furtherconstrain its mass to be less than 2 solar mass. we compare the energetics andmass limit derived for the m85 ot 2006-1 progenitor with those expected from asimple model of violent stellar mergers. combined with further modeling, thesenew clues may ultimately reveal the true nature of these puzzling events.

1112.3963	the luminous infrared host galaxy of short-duration grb 100206a	the known host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) to date arecharacterized by low to moderate star-formation rates and a broad range ofstellar masses. in this paper, we positionally associate the recentunambiguously short-hard swift grb 100206a with a disk galaxy at redshiftz=0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ~30 m_sun/yr, almost anorder of magnitude higher than any previously identified short grb host. usingphotometry from gemini, keck, pairitel, and wise, we show that the galaxy isvery red (g-k = 4.3 ab mag), heavily obscured (a_v ~ 2 mag), and has thehighest metallicity of any grb host to date (12 + log[o/h]_kd02 = 9.2): it is aclassical luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), with l_ir ~ 4 x 10^11 l_sun. whilethese properties could be interpreted to support an association of this grbwith very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energydistribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly olderstars is present. the current specific star-formation rate is modest (specificsfr ~ 0.5 gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantiallyelevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign ofrecent merger activity. our observations are therefore equally consistent withan older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard grbs.given the precedent established by previous short grb hosts and the significantfraction of the universe's stellar mass in lirg-like systems at z &gt;~0.3, anolder progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event.

1112.4851	the palomar transient factory photometric calibration	the palomar transient factory (ptf) provides multiple epoch imaging for alarge fraction of the sky. here we describe the photometric calibration of theptf data products that relates the ptf magnitudes to other mag systems. thecalibration process utilizes sdss r~16 mag point source objects as photometricstandards. during photometric conditions, this allows us to solve for theextinction coefficients and color terms, and to estimate the cameraillumination correction. this also enables the calibration of fields that areoutside the sdss footprint. we test the precision and repeatability of the ptfphotometric calibration. given that ptf is observing in a single filter eachnight, we define a ptf calibrated magnitude system for r-band and g-band. weshow that, in this system, 59% (47%) of the photometrically calibrated ptfr-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric precision of 0.02-0.04 mag. giventhe objects' color, the ptf magnitude system can be converted to other systems.a night-by-night comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual starsobserved on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a level of ~0.02mag. most of the data that were taken under non-photometric conditions can becalibrated relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained duringphotometric conditions. we provide a guide describing the use of the ptfphotometric calibration data products, as well as the transformations betweenthe ptf magnitude system and the sdss and johnson-cousins systems.

1205.7075	the afterglow and environment of the short grb111117a	we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of the shortgrb111117a, and follow-up observations of its host galaxy. from rapid opticaland radio observations we place limits of r \gtrsim 25.5 mag at \deltat \approx0.55 d and f_nu(5.8 ghz) &lt; 18 \mujy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.however, using a chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute positionof the x-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6times better than the swift-xrt position. this allows us to robustly identifythe host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20"from the host centroid. using optical and near-ir observations of the hostgalaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of thehighest for any short grb, and leading to a projected physical offset for theburst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short grbs. at this redshift,the isotropic gamma-ray energy is e_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg(rest-frame 23-2300 kev) with a peak energy of e_{pk} \approx 850-2300 kev(rest-frame). in conjunction with the isotropic x-ray energy, grb111117aappears to follow our recently-reported e_x,iso-e_gamma,iso-e_pk universalscaling. using the x-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detectionswe find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of e_{k,iso} \approx e_{gamma,iso},the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range ofepsilon_b=0.001-0.1). similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the x-raylight curve at t&lt;3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow oftheta_j&gt; 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). we conclude thatchandra observations of short grbs are effective at determining precisepositions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical andradio detections.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

0712.3585	grb 070201: a possible soft gamma ray repeater in m31	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 070201 was a bright short-duration hard-spectrumgrb detected by the inter-planetary network (ipn). its error quadrilateral,which has an area of 0.124 sq. deg, intersects some prominent spiral arms ofthe nearby m31 (andromeda) galaxy. given the properties of this grb, along withthe fact that ligo data argues against a compact binary merger origin in m31,this grb is an excellent candidate for an extragalactic soft gamma-ray repeater(sgr) giant flare, with energy of 1.4x10^45 erg. analysis of rotse-iiib visiblelight observations of m31, taken 10.6 hours after the burst and covering 42% ofthe grb error region, did not reveal any optical transient down to a limitingmagnitude of 17.1. we inspected archival and proprietary xmm-newton x-rayobservations of the intersection of the grb error quadrilateral and m31,obtained about four weeks prior to the outburst, in order to look for periodicvariable x-ray sources. no sgr or anomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) candidates(periods in range 1 to 20 s) were detected. we discuss the possibility ofdetecting extragalactic sgrs/axps by identifying their periodic x-ray lightcurves. our simulations suggest that the probability of detecting the periodicx-ray signal of one of the known galactic sgrs/axps, if placed in m31, is about10% (50%), using 50 ks (2 ms) xmm-newton exposures.

1305.1928	evidence for dust destruction from the early-time colour change of grb  120119a	we present broadband observations and analysis of swift gamma-ray burst (grb)120119a. our early-time afterglow detections began under 15 s after the burstin the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and they yield constraints on the burstenergetics and local environment. late-time afterglow observations of the burstshow evidence for a moderate column of dust (a_v ~ 1.1 mag) similar to, butstatistically distinct from, dust seen along small magellanic cloud sightlines.deep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly star-forming host galaxy.most notably, our early-time observations exhibit a significant red-to-bluecolour change in the first ~200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseenin grb afterglows. this colour change, which is coincident with the finalphases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark prediction of the photodestructionof dust in grb afterglows. we test whether dust-destruction signatures aresignificantly distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change inthe intrinsic spectral index {\beta}. we find that a time-varying power-lawspectrum alone cannot adequately describe the observed colour change, andallowing for dust destruction (via a time-varying a_v) significantly improvesthe fit. while not definitively ruling out other possibilities, this eventprovides the best support yet for the direct detection of dust destruction inthe local environment of a grb.

1306.2028	gemini spectroscopy of the short grb 130603b afterglow and host	we present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow andhost galaxy of the bright short-duration gamma-ray burst grb 130603b discoveredby the swift satellite. using the gemini south telescope, our prompt opticalspectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow superimposed on continuum andemission lines from the $z = 0.3568 \pm 0.0005$ host galaxy. the combination ofa relatively bright optical afterglow (r' = 21.52 at $\delta_t $= 8.4hr),together with an observed offset of 0\farcs9 from the host nucleus (4.8kpcprojected distance at z=0.3568), allow us to extract a relatively cleanspectrum dominated by afterglow light . the spatially resolved spectrum allowsus to constrain the properties of the explosion site directly, and comparethese with the host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration grb hostgalaxies. we find that while the host is a relatively luminous ($l \approx 0.8l^{*}_{b}$), star-forming galaxy with solar metallicity, the spectrum of theafterglow exhibits weak caii absorption features but negligible emissionfeatures. the explosion site therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation,consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in acompact binary merger scenario. the star formation rate (both in an absolutesense and normalized to the luminosity) and metallicity of the host are bothconsistent with the known sample of short-duration grb hosts and with recentresults which suggest grb130603b emission to be the product of the decay ofradioactive species produced during the merging process of a ns-ns binary("kilonova").  ultimately, the discovery of more events similar to grb130603b and theirrapid follow-up from 8-m class telescopes will open new opportunities for ourunderstanding of the final stages of compact-objects binary systems.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1307.2247	sn 2010jl: optical to hard x-ray observations reveal an explosion  embedded in a ten solar mass cocoon	(abridged) some supernovae (sne) may be powered by the interaction of the snejecta with a large amount of circumstellar matter (csm). here we outline amethod to measure the mass of the optically thick csm around such sne. wepresent observations of sn2010jl, including the first detection of a sn usingnustar. the total radiated luminosity of sn2010jl is extreme, at least 9e50erg. by modeling the visible-light data, we robustly show that the mass of thecircumstellar material within ~1e16 cm of the progenitor was in excess of 10solar masses, likely ejected tens of years prior to the sn explosion. ourmodeling suggests that the shock velocity during shock breakout was ~6000 km/s,decelerating to ~2600 km/s about two years after maximum light. our late-timenustar+xmm spectra of the sn presumably provide the first direct measurement ofsn shock velocity two years after the sn maximum light -- measured to be in therange of 2000 to 4500 km/s if the ions and electrons are in equilibrium, and&gt;~2000 km/s if they are not in equilibrium. this measurement is in agreementwith the shock velocity predicted by our modeling of the optical data. we alsoshow that the mean radial density distribution of the csm roughly follows anr^-2 law. a possible explanation for the massive csm with a wind-like profileis that they are the result of multiple pulsational pair instability eventsprior to the sn explosion, separated from each other by years.

1307.2366	a multi-wavelength investigation of the radio-loud supernova ptf11qcj  and its circumstellar environment	we present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic (fromradio to x-ray) follow-up observations of ptf11qcj, a supernova discovered bythe palomar transient factory. ptf11qcj is located at a distance of dl ~ 124mpc. our observations with the karl g. jansky very large array show that thisevent is radio-loud: ptf11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable tothat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (l_{5ghz} ~10^{29} erg/s/hz). ptf11qcj is also detected in x-rays with the chandraobservatory, and in the infrared band with spitzer. our multi-wavelengthanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. theradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} msun/yr x(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta(at ~10d after explosion). however, these estimates are derived assuming thesimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellarmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not accountfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.the radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as are-brightening at late times. the x-ray flux from ptf11qcj is compatible withthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within thelarge uncertainties). an ir light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreementwith our infrared data. our analysis of pre-explosion data from the palomartransient factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude m_r~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. based onour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that ptf11qcj fits theexpectations from the explosion of a wolf-rayet star. precursor eruptions maybe a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

1307.4401	the afterglow of grb 130427a from 1 to 10^16 ghz	we present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of grb 130427a, thebrightest (in total fluence) gamma-ray burst of the past 29 years. opticalspectroscopy from gemini-north reveals the redshift of the grb to be z=0.340,indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily the result of itsrelatively close proximity to earth; the intrinsic luminosities of both the grband its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright grbs. wepresent a large suite of multiwavelength observations spanning from 300 s to130 d after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows relativelysimple, smooth evolution at all frequencies with no significant late-timeflaring or rebrightening activity. the entire dataset from 1 ghz to 10 gev canbe modeled as synchrotron emission from a combination of reverse and forwardshocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model, providing strongsupport to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the natureof the gev emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other verybright grbs. a tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is requiredby the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-lossrate, perhaps due to low metallicity. grbs similar in nature to grb 130427a,inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probablynot uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past due to theirrelatively faint late-time radio emission; more such events should be found inabundance by the new generation of sensitive radio and millimeter instruments.

1311.6344	the host galaxies of type ia supernovae discovered by the palomar  transient factory	we present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of 82 low-redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf).we determine star-formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellarmasses and ages of these objects. as expected, strong correlations between thesn ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:fainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-richgalaxies. there is some evidence that redder sne ia explode in highermetallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the sn colour and hostgalaxy extinction based on the balmer decrement, suggesting that the colourvariation of these sne does not primarily arise from this source. sne ia inhigher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colourcorrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the strongercorrelation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the moreimportant variable. we also compared the host stellar mass distribution to thatin galaxy targeted sn surveys and the high-redshift untargeted supernova legacysurvey (snls). snls has many more low mass galaxies, while the targetedsearches have fewer. this can be explained by an evolution in the galaxystellar mass function, coupled with a sn delay-time distribution proportionalto $t^{-1}$. finally, we found no significant difference in themass--metallicity relation of our sn ia hosts compared to field galaxies,suggesting any metallicity effect on the sn ia rate is small.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1404.4085	interaction-powered supernovae: rise-time vs. peak-luminosity  correlation and the shock-breakout velocity	interaction of supernova (sn) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellarmedium (csm) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shockbreakout event. candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne.if some of these sne are powered by interaction, then there should be arelation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, andshock-breakout velocity. given that the shock velocity during shock breakout isnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between therise time and the peak luminosity of these sne. here, we present a sample of 15sne iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peakluminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory. wereport on a possible correlation between the r-band rise time and peakluminosity of these sne, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. assuming thatthese sne are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theoryallows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. the lowerlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected forsne (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). this supports the suggestion that the early-time lightcurves of sne iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm. we note thatsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. performing such atest on other classes of sne (e.g., superluminous sne) can be used to rule outthe interaction model for a class of events.

1406.7640	a wolf-rayet-like progenitor of supernova sn 2013cu from spectral  observations of a wind	the explosive fate of massive stripped wolf-rayet (w-r) stars is a key openquestion in stellar physics. an appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient w-rstars are the progenitors of some h-poor supernova (sn) explosions of typesiib, ib, and ic. a blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent withthose of some w-r stars, has been recently identified at the location of asn~ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined tohave been the progenitor. similar previous works have so far only resulted innondetections. comparison of early photometric observations of type icsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii&lt;10^12 cm, as expected for some w-r stars. however, the hallmark signature ofw-r stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. here,we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum ofsn 2013cu (iptf13ast; type iib) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flashspectroscopy"). we identify w-r-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor ofthe wn(h) subclass. the extent of this dense wind may indicate increased massloss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

1506.01624	optimisation of the swift x-ray follow-up of advanced ligo and virgo  gravitational wave triggers in 2015--16	one of the most exciting near-term prospects in physics is the potentialdiscovery of gravitational waves by the advanced ligo and virgo detectors. tomaximise both the confidence of the detection and the science return, it isessential to identify an electromagnetic counterpart. this is not trivial, asthe events are expected to be poorly localised, particularly in the near-term,with error regions covering hundreds or even thousands of square degrees. inthis paper we discuss the prospects for finding an x-ray counterpart to agravitational wave trigger with the swift x-ray telescope, using the assumptionthat the trigger is caused by a binary neutron star merger which also producesa short gamma-ray burst. we show that it is beneficial to target galaxieswithin the gw error region, highlighting the need for substantially completegalaxy catalogues out to distances of 300 mpc. we also show that nearby,on-axis short grbs are either extremely rare, or are systematically lessluminous than those detected to date. we consider the prospects for detectingafterglow emission from an an off-axis grb which triggered the gw facilities,finding that the detectability, and the best time to look, are stronglydependent on the characteristics of the burst such as circumburst density andour viewing angle.

1508.04420	detection of broad h$\alpha$ emission lines in the late-time spectra of  a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova	iptf13ehe is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=0.3434, witha slow-evolving light curve and spectral features similar to sn2007bi. it riseswithin (83-148)days (rest-frame) to reach a peak bolometric luminosity of1.3x$10^{44}$erg/s, then decays very slowly at 0.015mag. per day. the measuredejecta velocity is 13000km/s. the inferred explosion characteristics, such asthe ejecta mass (67-220$m_\odot$), the total radiative and kinetic energy($10^{51}$ &amp; 2x$10^{53}$erg respectively), is typical of a slow-evolving h-poorslsn event. however, the late-time spectrum taken at +251days reveals a balmerhalpha emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never beendetected before among other h-poor slsne. the broad component has a velocitywidth of ~4500km/s and has a ~300km/s blue-ward shift relative to the narrowcomponent. we interpret this broad h$\alpha$ emission with luminosity of$\sim$2$\times10^{41}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ as resulting from the interaction betweenthe supernova ejecta and a discrete h-rich shell, located at a distance of$\sim4\times10^{16}$\,cm from the explosion site. this ejecta-csm interactioncauses the rest-frame r-band lc to brighten at late times. the fact that thelate-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock ionized csm shellimplies that its thomson scattering optical depth is likely &lt;1, thus settingupper limits on the csm mass &lt;30$m_\odot$ and the volume number density&lt;4x$10^8cm^{-3}$. of the existing models, a pulsational pair instabilitysupernova model can naturally explain the observed 30$m_\odot$ h-shell, ejectedfrom a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95-150)$m_\odot$ about 40 yearsago. we estimate that at least $\sim$15\%\ of all slsne-i may have late-timebalmer emission lines.

astro-ph;0502468	the discovery of the optical and near-ir afterglows of the first swift  gamma-ray bursts	we present optical and near-infrared searches for afterglow emission from thefirst four swift bursts with accurate positions from the x-ray telescope (xrt).using telescopes at las campanas, keck, and palomar observatories we rapidlyidentified and followed up afterglows for three of the four bursts. the burstpositions were also observed with the very large array, but no radio afterglowemission was detected. the optical/nir afterglows are fainter than about 75% ofall afterglows detected to date, with grb 050126 being the faintest, and wereidentified thanks to accurate and rapid positions from the xrt and rapidresponse with &gt;1-m telescopes. this suggests that the fraction of dust-obscuredbursts is small, &lt;10% when combined with afterglows localized by the hete-2soft x-ray camera. the x-ray fluxes are typical of the known population, withthe exception of grb 050126 which has the faintest x-ray afterglow to date(normalized to t=10 hr), and was detected thanks to a response time of only 130s after the burst. finally, we find that all three optical/nir afterglows arelocated &lt;2 arcsec away from the nominal xrt positions, suggesting that the xrtis capable of delivering highly accurate positions, which will revolutionizeafterglow studies.

astro-ph;0505107	the afterglows, redshifts, and properties of swift gamma-ray bursts	we present optical, near-ir, and radio follow up of sixteen swift bursts,including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination forthree. these observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide anafterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-ir, much higher than inprevious missions (bepposax, hete-2, integral, and ipn). the optical/near-irafterglows of swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than thoseof previous missions. the x-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared tothose of pre-swift bursts. in the radio the limiting factor is the vlathreshold and the detection rate for swift bursts is similar to that for pastmissions. the redshift distribution of pre-swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereasthe five swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between1.3 and 3.2. from these results we conclude that (i) the pre-swiftdistributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of swift result in a betterrepresentation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (whichare higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the burstscan be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.we remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity swift bursts,and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 peryear), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of batse. in viewof these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to makesignificant changes in follow up strategies of swift events.

astro-ph;0506472	a high angular-resolution search for the progenitor of the type ic  supernova 2004gt	we report the results of a high-spatial-resoltion search for the progenitorof type ic supernova sn 2004gt, using the newly commissioned keck laser-guidestar adaptive optics system (lgsao) along with archival hubble space telescopedata. this is the deepest search yet performed for the progenitor of any typeib/c event in a wide wavelength range stretching from the far uv to the nearir. we determine that the progenitor of sn 2004gt was most likely less luminousthan m_v=-5.5 and m_b=-6.5 magnitudes. the massive stars exploding ashydrogen-deficient core-collapse supernovae (sne) should have lost their outerhydrogen envelopes prior to their explosion, either through winds -- such starsare identified within our galaxy as wolf-rayet (w-r) stars -- or to a binarycompanion. the luminosity limits we set rule out more than half of the knowngalactic w-r stars as possible progenitors of this event. in particular, theyimply that a w-r progenitor should have been among the more-evolved (highlystripped, less luminous) of these stars, a concrete constraint on itsevolutionary state just prior to core collapse. the possibility of a lessluminous, lower-mass binary progenitor cannot be constrained. this studydemonstrates the power of lgs observations in furthering our understanding ofcore collapse, and the physics powering supernovae, grbs and xrfs.

astro-ph;0508115	the afterglow and elliptical host galaxy of the short gamma-ray burst  grb 050724	despite a rich phenomenology, gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are divided into twoclasses based on their duration and spectral hardness -- the long-soft and theshort-hard bursts. the discovery of afterglow emission from long grbs was awatershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hencethe death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51erg. while theoretical arguments suggest that short grbs are produced in thecoalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), theprogenitors, energetics, and environments of these events remain elusivedespite recent localizations. here we report the discovery of the first radioafterglow from a short burst, grb 050724, which unambiguously associates itwith an elliptical galaxy at a redshift, z=0.257. we show that the burst ispowered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long grbs, with theejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is10-1000 times smaller. more importantly, the nature of the host galaxydemonstrates that short grbs arise from an old (&gt;1 gyr) stellar population,strengthening earlier suggestions, and providing support for coalescing compactobject binaries as the progenitors.

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0511498	spectroscopy of grb 050505 at z=4.275: a logn(hi)=22.1 dla host galaxy  and the nature of the progenitor	we present the discovery of the optical afterglow of grb 050505 and anoptical absorption spectrum obtained with the keck i 10-m telescope. thespectrum exhibits three redshifted absorption systems with the highest, atz=4.2748, arising in the grb host galaxy. the host absorption system is markedby a damped ly-alpha (dla) feature with a neutral hydrogen column density oflogn(hi)=22.05+/-0.10, higher than that of any qso-dla detected to date, butsimilar to several other recent measurements from grb spectra. in addition, wedetect absorption lines from both low- and high-ionization species from whichwe deduce a metallicity, z~0.06 z_solar, with a depletion pattern that isroughly similar to that of the galactic warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo.more importantly, we detect strong absorption from siii* indicating a denseenvironment, n_h&gt;10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with a size of about4 pc. in addition, the civ absorption system spans a velocity range of about1000 km/s, which is not detected in any other absorption feature. we show thatthe most likely interpretation for this wide velocity range is absorption inthe wind from the progenitor star. in this context, the lack of correspondingsiiv absorption indicates that the progenitor had a mass of &lt;25 m_solar and ametallicity &lt;0.1 z_solar, and therefore required a binary companion to ejectits hydrogen envelope prior to the grb explosion. finally, by extending thegrb-dla sample to z~4.3 we show that these objects appear to follow a similarmetallicity-redshift relation as in qso-dlas, but with systematically highermetallicities. it remains to be seen whether this trend is simply due to thehigher neutral hydrogen columns in grb-dlas, or if it is a manifestation ofdifferent star formation properties in grb-dlas.

astro-ph;0601455	the afterglow, energetics and host galaxy of the short-hard gamma-ray  burst 051221a	we present detailed optical, x-ray and radio observations of the brightafterglow of the short gamma-ray burst 051221a obtained with gemini, swift/xrt,and the very large array, as well as optical spectra from which we measure theredshift of the burst, z=0.5464. at this redshift the isotropic-equivalentprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standardafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy issimilar, e_k,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. an observed jet break at t ~ 5 daysindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-correctedenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred forprevious short grbs. we further show that the burst experienced an episode ofenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which wasaccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. this result providescontinued evidence that the central engines of short grbs may be activesignificantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide rangeof lorentz factors. finally, we show that the host galaxy of grb051221a isactively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 m_solar/yr, but at the same timeexhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 gyr) and nearsolar metallicity. the lack of bright supernova emission and the lowcircumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that shortbursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistentwith a compact object merger. given that the total energy release is a factorof ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,this suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power theburst.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

astro-ph;0604389	relativistic ejecta from xrf 060218 and the rate of cosmic explosions	over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) including thesubclass of x-ray flashes (xrfs) have been revealed to be a rare variety oftype ibc supernova (sn). while all these events result from the death ofmassive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of grbs and xrfs exceed thoseof ordinary type ibc sne by many orders of magnitude. the essential physicalprocess that causes a dying star to produce a grb or xrf, and not just an sn,remains the crucial open question. here we present radio and x-ray observationsof xrf 060218 (associated with sn 2006aj), the second nearest grb identifiedto-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the largercontext of cosmic explosions. we show that this event is 100 times lessenergetic but ten times more common than cosmological grbs. moreover, it isdistinguished from ordinary type ibc sne by the presence of 10^48 erg coupledto mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed,rapidly rotating compact source) which produces x-rays for weeks after theexplosion. this suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the keyphysical distinction between grbs/xrfs and ordinary sne, while the nature ofthe central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts fromlow-luminosity, spherical events like xrf 060218.

astro-ph;0604580	an energetic afterglow from a distant stellar explosion	we present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift(z=6.295) burst grb 050904. the peak flux density for this burst is similar totypical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grb). we further show that beyond aredshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largelyinsensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. by combining the existingx-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for thekinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of thecircumburst medium into which it expands. both the kinetic and radiated energyindicate that grb 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). moreimportantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the densitystructure of the circumburst medium. we conclude that grb 050904 exploded intoa constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitudeabove the nominal value for low-redshift grbs. the next generation ofcentimeter (evla) and millimeter radio instuments (alma) will be able toroutinely detect events like grb 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift universe.

astro-ph;0608183	multi-wavelength observations of grb 050820a: an exceptionally energetic  event followed from start to finish	we present observations of the unusually bright and long gamma-ray burst grb050820a, one of the best-sampled broadband data sets in the swift era. thegamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before themain event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to aphysical mechanism distinct from the grb itself. the large time lag between theprecursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in thegamma-ray, x-ray, and optical band-passes, something only achieved for ahandful of events to date. while the contemporaneous x-rays are the low-energytail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-rayflux. instead, the early-time optical data appear mostly consistent with theforward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical, and are thereforelikely the beginning of the afterglow. on hour time scales after the burst, thex-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion ofthe shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is aperiod of energy injection. observations at late times allow us to constrainthe collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to theta = 6.8 - 9.3 degrees.our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow and the promptgamma-ray energy release make grb 050820a one of the most energetic events forwhich such values could be determined.

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).
