0907.0370	high zenith angle observations of pks 2155-304 with the magic telescope	the high frequency peaked bl lac pks 2155-304 with a redshift z=0.116 wasdiscovered 1997 in the vhe range by the university of durham mark 6 gamma-raytelescope in australia with a flux corresponding to approx. 0.2 times the crabnebula flux. it was later observed and detected with high significance by thesouthern observatories cangaroo and h.e.s.s. establishing this source as thebest studied southern tev blazar. detection from the northern hemisphere wasvery difficult due to challenging observation conditions under large zenithangles. in july 2006, the h.e.s.s. collaboration reported an extraordinaryoutburst of vhe gamma-emission. during the outburst, the vhe gamma-ray emissionwas found to be variable on the time scales of minutes and at a mean flux ofapprox. 7 times the flux observed from the crab nebula. the magic collaborationoperates a 17m imaging air cherenkov telescope at la palma (northernhemisphere). follow up observations of the extraordinary outburst have beentriggered in a target of opportunity program by an alert from the h.e.s.s.collaboration. the measured spectrum and light curve are presented.

0907.0466	the readout system of the magic-ii cherenkov telescope	in this contribution we describe the hardware, firmware and softwarecomponents of the readout system of the magic-ii cherenkov telescope on thecanary island la palma. the pmt analog signals are transmitted by means ofoptical fibers from the magic-ii camera to the 80 m away counting house wherethey are routed to the new high bandwidth and fully programmable receiverboards (monster), which convert back the signals from optical to electricalones. then the signals are split, one half provide the input signals for thelevel one trigger system while the other half is sent to the digitizing units.the fast cherenkov pulses are sampled by low-power domino ring sampler chips(drs2) and temporarily stored in an array of 1024 capacitors. signals aresampled at the ultra-fast speed of 2 gsample/s, which allows a very precisemeasurement of the signal arrival times in all pixels. they are then digitizedwith 12-bit resolution by an external adc readout at 40 mhz speed. the dominosamplers are integrated in the newly designed mezzanines which equip a set offourteen multi-purpose pulsar boards. finally, the data are sent through ans-link optical interface to a single computer. the entire daq hardware iscontrolled through a vme interface and steered by the slow control softwareprogram (mir). the data acquisition software program (daq) proceeds finally tothe event building and data storage.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1111.0350	results from the binaries ls i +61{\deg}303 and ls 5039 after 2.5 years  of fermi monitoring	the fermi large area telescope (lat) has made the first definitive gevdetections of the binaries ls i +61^{\circ}303 and ls5039 in the first yearafter its launch in august 2008. these detections were unambiguous because,apart from a reduced positional uncertainty, the gamma-ray emission in eachcase was orbitally modulated with the corresponding orbital period. the latresults posed new questions about the nature of these objects, after theunexpected observation of an exponential cutoff in the gev gamma-ray spectra ofboth ls i +61^{\circ}303 and ls5039, at least along part of their orbitalmotion. we present here the analysis of new data from the lat, comprising 2.5years of observations through which ls i +61^{\circ}303 continues to providesome surprises. we find an increase in flux in march 2009 and a steady decreasein the flux fraction modulation. the lat now detects emission up to 30 gev,where prior datasets led to upper limits only. at the same time,contemporaneous tev observations either no longer detected the source, or foundit -at least in some orbits- close to periastron, far from the usual phases inwhich the source usually appeared at tev energies. the on-source exposure of ls5039 has also drastically increased along the last years, and whilst ouranalysis shows no new behavior in comparison with our earlier report, thehigher statistics of the current dataset allows for a deeper investigation ofits orbital and spectral evolution.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1111.6572	detection of the gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303 in a low flux state at  very high energy gamma-rays with the magic telescopes in 2009	we present very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) {\gamma}-ray observations ofthe {\gamma}-ray binary system ls i+61 303 obtained with the magic stereosystem between 2009 october and 2010 january. we detect a 6.3{\sigma}{\gamma}-ray signal above 400 gev in the combined data set. the integral fluxabove an energy of 300 gev is f(e&gt;300 gev)=(1.4 +- 0.3stat +- 0.4syst) *10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which corresponds to about 1.3% of the crab nebulaflux in the same energy range. the orbit-averaged flux of ls i +61 303 in theorbital phase interval 0.6--0.7, where a maximum of the tev flux is expected,is lower by almost an order of magnitude compared to our previous measurementsbetween 2005 september and 2008 january. this provides evidence for a new lowemission state in ls i +61 303. we find that the change to the low flux statecannot be solely explained by an increase of photon-photon absorption aroundthe compact star.

1112.3917	detection of very-high energy \gamma-ray emission from ngc 1275 by the  magic telescopes	we report on the detection of very-high energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rayemission from ngc 1275, the central radio galaxy of the perseus cluster ofgalaxies. the source has been detected by the magic telescopes with astatistical significance of 6.6 sigma above 100 gev in 46 hr of stereoobservations carried out between august 2010 and february 2011. the measureddifferential energy spectrum between 70 gev and 500 gev can be described by apower law with a steep spectral index of \gamma=-4.1+/-0.7stat+/-0.3syst, andthe average flux above 100 gev is f_{gamma}=(1.3+/-0.2stat+/-0.3syst) x 10^-11cm^-2 s^-1. these results, combined with the power-law spectrum measured in thefirst two years of observations by the fermi-lat above 100 mev, with a spectralindex of gamma ~ -2.1, strongly suggest the presence of a break or cut-offaround tens of gev in the ngc 1275 spectrum. the light curve of the sourceabove 100 gev does not show hints of variability on a month time scale.finally, we report on the nondetection in the present data of the radio galaxyic 310, previously discovered by the fermi-lat and magic. the derived fluxupper limit f^{u.l.}_{gamma} (&gt;300 gev)=1.2 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 is a factor ~ 3lower than the mean flux measured by magic between october 2009 and february2010, thus confirming the year time-scale variability of the source at vhe.

1201.4074	morphological and spectral properties of the w51 region measured with  the magic telescopes	the w51 complex hosts the supernova remnant w51c which is known to interactwith the molecular clouds in the star forming region w51b. in addition, apossible pulsar wind nebula cxo j192318.5+140305 was found likely associatedwith the supernova remnant. gamma-ray emission from this region was discoveredby fermi/lat (between 0.2 and 50 gev) and h.e.s.s. (&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1202.1866	long-term monitoring of the high-energy gamma-ray emission from ls i  +61{\deg} 303 and ls 5039	the fermi large area telescope (lat) reported the first definitive gevdetections of the binaries ls i +61\degree 303 and ls 5039 in the first yearafter its launch in june, 2008. these detections were unambiguous as aconsequence of the reduced positional uncertainty and the detection ofmodulated gamma-ray emission on the corresponding orbital periods. an analysisof new data from the lat, comprising 30 months of observations, identifies achange in the gamma-ray behavior of ls i +61\degree 303. an increase in flux isdetected in march 2009 and a steady decline in the orbital flux modulation isobserved. significant emission up to 30gev is detected by the lat; priordatasets led to upper limits only. contemporaneous tev observations no longerdetected the source, or found it -in one orbit- close to periastron, far fromthe phases at which the source previously appeared at tev energies. thedetailed numerical simulations and models that exist within the literature donot predict or explain many of these features now observed at gev and tevenergies. new ideas and models are needed to fully explain and understand thisbehavior. a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the spectral characterizationof ls i +61\degree 303 in the gev regime ascribes a power law with anexponential cutoff spectrum along each analyzed portion of the system's orbit.the on-source exposure of ls 5039 is also substantially increased with respectto our prior publication. in this case, whereas the general gamma-rayproperties remain consistent, the increased statistics of the current datasetallows for a deeper investigation of its orbital and spectral evolution.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1209.0357	prospects for observations of pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae with cta	the last few years have seen a revolution in very-high gamma-ray astronomy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) driven largely by a new generation of cherenkov telescopes(namely the h.e.s.s. telescope array, the magic and magic-ii large telescopesand the veritas telescope array). the cherenkov telescope array (cta) projectforesees a factor of 5 to 10 improvement in sensitivity above 0.1 tev,extending the accessible energy range to higher energies up to 100 tev, in thegalactic cut-off regime, and down to a few tens gev, covering the vhe photonspectrum with good energy and angular resolution. as a result of the fastdevelopment of the vhe field, the number of pulsar wind nebulae (pwne) detectedhas increased from one pwn in the early '90s to more than two dozen firmcandidates today. also, the low energy threshold achieved and good sensitivityat tev energies has resulted in the detection of pulsed emission from the crabpulsar (or its close environment) opening new and exiting expectations aboutthe pulsed spectra of the high energy pulsars powering pwne. here we discussthe physics goals we aim to achieve with cta on pulsar and pwne physicsevaluating the response of the instrument for different configurations.

1209.0582	gamma-ray signatures of cosmic ray acceleration, propagation, and  confinement in the era of cta	galactic cosmic rays are commonly believed to be accelerated at supernovaremnants via diffusive shock acceleration. despite the popularity of this idea,a conclusive proof for its validity is still missing. gamma-ray astronomyprovides us with a powerful tool to tackle this problem, because gamma rays areproduced during cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas. the detection ofgamma rays from several supernova remnants is encouraging, but still does notconstitute a proof of the scenario, the main problem being the difficulty indisentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the emission. oncereleased by their sources, cosmic rays diffuse in the interstellar medium, andfinally escape from the galaxy. the diffuse gamma-ray emission from thegalactic disk, as well as the gamma-ray emission detected from a few galaxiesis largely due to the interactions of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.on much larger scales, cosmic rays are also expected to permeate theintracluster medium, since they can be confined and accumulated within clustersof galaxies for cosmological times. thus, the detection of gamma rays fromclusters of galaxies, or even upper limits on their emission, will allow us toconstrain the cosmic ray output of the sources they contain, such as normalgalaxies, agns, and cosmological shocks. in this paper, we describe the impactthat the cherenkov telescope array, a future ground-based facility forvery-high energy gamma-ray astronomy, is expected to have in this field ofresearch.

1210.3215	binaries with the eyes of cta	the binary systems that have been detected in gamma rays have proven veryuseful to study high-energy processes, in particular particle acceleration,emission and radiation reprocessing, and the dynamics of the underlyingmagnetized flows. binary systems, either detected or potential gamma-rayemitters, can be grouped in different subclasses depending on the nature of thebinary components or the origin of the particle acceleration: the interactionof the winds of either a pulsar and a massive star or two massive stars;accretion onto a compact object and jet formation; and interaction of arelativistic outflow with the external medium. we evaluate the potentialitiesof an instrument like the cherenkov telescope array (cta) to study thenon-thermal physics of gamma-ray binaries, which requires the observation ofhigh-energy phenomena at different time and spatial scales. we analyze thecapability of cta, under different configurations, to probe the spectral,temporal and spatial behavior of gamma-ray binaries in the context of the knownor expected physics of these sources. cta will be able to probe with highspectral, temporal and spatial resolution the physical processes behind thegamma-ray emission in binaries, significantly increasing as well the number ofknown sources. this will allow the derivation of information on the particleacceleration and emission sites qualitatively better than what is currentlyavailable.

1401.7154	magic reveals a complex morphology within the unidentified gamma-ray  source hess j1857+026	hess j1857+026 is an extended tev gamma-ray source that was discovered byh.e.s.s. as part of its galactic plane survey. given its broadband spectralenergy distribution and its spatial coincidence with the young energetic pulsarpsr j1856+0245, the source has been put forward as a pulsar wind nebula (pwn)candidate. magic has performed follow-up observations aimed at mapping thesource down to energies approaching 100 gev in order to better understand itscomplex morphology. hess j1857+026 was observed by magic in 2010, yielding 29hours of good quality stereoscopic data that allowed us to map the sourceregion in two separate ranges of energy. we detected very-high-energy gamma-rayemission from hess j1857+026 with a significance of $12 \sigma$ above $150$gev. the differential energy spectrum between $100$ gev and $13$ tev is welldescribed by a power law function $dn/de = n_0(e/1\textrm{tev})^{-\gamma}$ with$n_0 = (5.37 \pm0.44_{stat} \pm1.5_{sys}) \times 10^{-12} (\textrm{tev}^{-1}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ $\textrm{ s}^{-1})$ and $\gamma = 2.16\pm0.07_{stat}\pm0.15_{sys}$, which bridges the gap between the gev emission measured byfermi-lat and the multi-tev emission measured by h.e.s.s.. in addition, wepresent a detailed analysis of the energy-dependent morphology of this region.we couple these results with archival multi-wavelength data and outlineevidence in favor of a two-source scenario, whereby one source is associatedwith a pwn, while the other could be linked with a molecular cloud complexcontaining an hii region and a possible gas cavity.

1402.0291	search for very-high-energy gamma rays from the z = 0.896 quasar 4c  +55.17 with the magic telescopes	the bright gamma-ray quasar 4c +55.17 is a distant source ($z = 0.896$) witha hard spectrum at gev energies as observed by the large area telescope (lat)on board the {{\it fermi}} satellite. this source is identified as a goodsource candidate for very-high-energy (vhe; $&gt; 30$ gev) gamma rays. in generalvhe gamma rays from distant sources provide an unique opportunity to study theextragalactic background light (ebl) and underlying astrophysics. the fluxintensity of this source in the vhe range is investigated. then, constraints onthe ebl are derived from the attenuation of gamma-ray photons coming from thedistant blazar. we searched for a gamma-ray signal from this object using the35-hour observations taken by the magic telescopes between november 2010 andjanuary 2011. no significant vhe gamma-ray signal was detected. we computed theupper limits of the integrated gamma-ray flux at $95\%$ confidence level of$9.4 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above $100$ gev and $200$ gev, respectively. the differential upperlimits in four energy bins in the range from $80$ gev to $500$ gev are alsoderived. the upper limits are consistent with the attenuation predicted bylow-flux ebl models on the assumption of a simple power-law spectrumextrapolated from lat data.

1402.4219	detection of bridge emission above 50 gev from the crab pulsar with the  magic telescopes	the crab pulsar is the only astronomical pulsed source detected at very highenergy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma-rays. the emission mechanism of vhe pulsation isnot yet fully understood, although several theoretical models have beenproposed. in order to test the new models, we measured the light curve and thespectra of the crab pulsar with high precision by means of deep observations.we analyzed 135 hours of selected magic data taken between 2009 and 2013 instereoscopic mode. in order to discuss the spectral shape in connection withlower energies, 4.6 years of {\it fermi}-lat data were also analyzed. the knowntwo pulses per period were detected with a significance of $8.0 \sigma$ and$12.6 \sigma$. in addition, significant emission was found between the twopulses with $6.2 \sigma$. we discovered the bridge emission above 50 gevbetween the two main pulses. this emission can not be explained with theexisting theories. these data can be used for testing new theoretical models.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.02711	discovery of variable vhe gamma-ray emission from the binary system 1fgl  j1018.6-5856	re-observations with the h.e.s.s. telescope array of the very-high-energy(vhe) source hess j1018-589 a coincident with the fermi-lat $\gamma$-ray binary1fgl j1018.6-5856 have resulted in a source detection significance of more than9$\sigma$, and the detection of variability ($\chi^2$/$\nu$ of 238.3/155) inthe emitted $\gamma$-ray flux. this variability confirms the association ofhess j1018-589 a with the high-energy $\gamma$-ray binary detected byfermi-lat, and also confirms the point-like source as a new very-high-energybinary system. the spectrum of hess j1018-589 a is best fit with a power-lawfunction with photon index $\gamma = 2.20 \pm 0.14_{\rm stat} \pm 0.2_{\rmsys}$. emission is detected up to ~20 tev. the mean differential flux level is$(2.9 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-13}$ tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev,equivalent to ~1% of the flux from the crab nebula at the same energy.variability is clearly detected in the night-by-night lightcurve. when foldedon the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phasewith the observed x-ray and high-energy phaseograms. the fit of the h.e.s.s.phaseogram to a constant flux provides evidence of periodicity at the level of3$\sigma$. the shape of the vhe phaseogram and measured spectrum suggest a lowinclination, low eccentricity system with a modest impact from vhe $\gamma$-rayabsorption due to pair production ($\tau$ &lt; 1 at 300 gev).

1504.06115	magic detection of short-term variability of the high-peaked bl lac  object 1es 0806+524	the high-frequency-peaked bl lac (hbl) 1es 0806+524 (z = 0.138) wasdiscovered in vhe $\gamma$ rays in 2008. until now, the broad-band spectrum of1es 0806+524 has been only poorly characterized, in particular at highenergies. we analysed multiwavelength observations from $\gamma$ rays to radioperformed from 2011 january to march, which were triggered by the high activitydetected at optical frequencies. these observations constitute the most precisedetermination of the broad-band emission of 1es 0806+524 to date. thestereoscopic magic observations yielded a $\gamma$-ray signal above 250 gev of$(3.7 \pm 0.7)$ per cent of the crab nebula flux with a statisticalsignificance of 9.9 $\sigma$. the multiwavelength observations showedsignificant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a vhe$\gamma$-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which providedunprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1es 0806+524. the spectrumof this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of $2.97 \pm0.29$ between $\sim$150 gev and 1 tev and an integral flux of $(9.3 \pm 1.9)$per cent of the crab nebula flux above 250 gev. the spectrum during thenon-flaring vhe activity is compatible with the only available vhe observationperformed in 2008 with veritas when the source was in a low optical state. thebroad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zonesynchrotron self compton model with parameters typical for hbls, indicatingthat 1es 0806+524 is not substantially different from the hbls previouslydetected.

1509.01364	development of slow control boards for the large size telescopes of the  cherenkov telescope array	the camera of the large size telescopes (lsts) of the cherenkov telescopearray (cta) consists of 265 photosensor modules, each of them containing 7photomultiplier tubes (pmts), a slow control board (scb), a readout board, anda trigger logic. we have developed the scb, which is installed between the 7pmts and the readout board. the main task for scbs is the controlling of thehigh voltages for the pmts and the monitoring of their anode currents. inaddition, the scb provides the functionality to create test pulses that can beinjected at the input of the pmt preamplifier in order to emulate a pmt signalwithout the need of setting a high voltage, or even without the pmt itself. thetest pulses have a very similar width as the pmt pulses (less than 3 ns fwhm)and their amplitude can be adjusted in a wide dynamic range. these featuresallow us not only to test the functionality of the camera modules but also tofully characterize these. we report on the design and the functions of the scbtogether with the results of test measurements.

1510.03101	vhe gamma-ray observations of transient and variable stellar objects  with the magic telescopes	galactic transients, x-ray and gamma-ray binaries provide a properenvironment for particle acceleration. this leads to the production of gammarays with energies reaching the gev-tev regime. magic has carried out deepobservations of different transient and variable stellar objects of which wehighlight 4 of them here: lsi+61 303, mwc 656, cygnus x-1 and sn 2014j. wepresent the results of those observations, including long-term monitoring ofcygnus x-1 and lsi+61 303 (7 and 8 years, respectively). the former is one ofthe brightest x-ray sources and best studied microquasars across a broad rangeof wavelengths, whose steady and variable signal was studied by magic within amultiwavelength scenario. the latest results of an unique object, mwc 656, arealso shown in this presentation. this source is the first high-mass x-raybinary system detected that is composed of a black hole and a be star. finally,we report on the observations of sn 2014j, the nearest type ia sn of the last40 years. its proximity and early observation gave a remarkable opportunity tostudy important features of these powerful events.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1511.06778	the 1st fermi lat supernova remnant catalog	to uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (snrs) at highenergies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to100 gev using data from the fermi large area telescope. based on the spatialoverlap of sources detected at gev energies with snrs known from radio surveys,we classify 30 sources as likely gev snrs. we also report 14 marginalassociations and 245 flux upper limits. a mock catalog in which the positionsof known remnants are scrambled in galactic longitude, allows us to determinean upper limit of 22% on the number of gev candidates falsely identified assnrs. we have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatialsystematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a keycomponent of all galactic fermi lat analyses. by studying remnants uniformly inaggregate, we measure the gev properties common to these objects and provide acrucial context for the detailed modeling of individual snrs. combining our gevresults with multiwavelength (mw) data, including radio, x-ray, and tev,demonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple modelsdescribing the gev and radio emission from these objects. we model the gev andmw emission from snrs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution toobserved galactic cosmic rays.
