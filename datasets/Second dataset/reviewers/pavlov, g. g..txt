0903.4864	chandra observation of quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries in the globular  cluster ngc 6304	this paper presents the analysis of candidate quiescent low mass xray binarie(qlmxbs) observed during a short chandra/acis observation of the globularcluster (gc) ngc 6304. two out of the three candidate qlmxbs of this cluster,xmmu 171433-292747 and xmmu 171421-292917, lie within the field of view. thispermits comparison with the discovery observation of these sources. the one inthe gc core -- xmmu 171433-292747 -- is spatially resolved into two separatex-ray sources, one of which is consistent with a pure h-atmosphere qlmxb, andthe other is an x-ray power-law spectrum source. these two spectral componentsseparately account for those observed from xmmu 171433-292747 in its discoveryobservation. we find that the observed flux and spectral parameters of theh-atmosphere spectral components are consistent with the previous observation,as expected from a qlmxb powered by deep crustal heating. xmmu 171421-292917also has neutron star atmosphere spectral parameters consistent with those inthe xmm-newton observation and the observed flux has decreased by a factor0.54^{+0.30}_{-0.24}.

0904.2219	chandra observation of the relativistic binary j1906+0746	psr j1906+0746 is a 112-kyr-old radio pulsar in a tight relativistic binarywith a compact high-mass companion, at the distance of about 5 kpc. we observedthis unique system with the chandra acis detector for 31.6 ks. surprisingly,not a single photon was detected within the 3" radius from the j1906+0746 radioposition. for a plausible range of hydrogen column densities,n_h=(0.5-1)\times10^{22} cm^{-2}, the nondetection corresponds to the 90% upperlimit of (3-5)\times10^{30} erg s^{-1} on the unabsorbed 0.5-8 kev luminosityfor the power-law model with gamma=1.0-2.0, and ~10^{32} erg s^{-1} on thebolometric luminosity of the thermal emission from the ns surface. the inferredlimits are the lowest known for pulsars with spin-down properties similar tothose of psr j1906+0746. we have also tentatively detected a puzzling extendedstructure which looks like a tilted ring with a radius of 1.6' centered on thepulsar. the measured 0.5-8 kev flux of the feature, 3.1\times10^{-14} ergcm^{-2} s^{-1}, implies an unabsorbed luminosity of 1.2\times10^{32} erg s^{-1}(4.5\times10^{-4} of the pulsar's spin-down power). although all conventionalinterpretations of the ring appear to be problematic, the pulsar-wind nebulawith an unusually underluminous pulsar remains the most viable interpretation.

0905.3190	a dedicated chandra acis observation of the central compact object in  the cassiopeia a supernova remnant	we present results of a recent chandra x-ray observatory observation of thecentral compact object (cco) in the supernova remnant cassiopeia a. thisobservation was obtained in an instrumental configuration that combines a highspatial resolution with a minimum spectral distortion, and it allowed us tosearch for pulsations with periods longer than 0.68 s. we found no evidence ofextended emission associated with the cco, nor statistically significantpulsations (the 3-sigma upper limit on pulsed fraction is about 16%). the fitsof the cco spectrum with the power-law model yield a large photon index,gamma\approx 5, and a hydrogen column density larger than that obtained fromthe snr spectra. the fits with the blackbody model are statisticallyunacceptable. better fits are provided by hydrogen or helium neutron staratmosphere models, with the best-fit effective temperature kt_{eff}^\infty\approx 0.2 kev, but they require a small star's radius, r = 4 - 5.5 km, and alow mass, m &lt; 0.8 m_sol. a neutron star cannot have so small radius and mass,but the observed emission might emerge from an atmosphere of a strange quarkstar. more likely, the cco could be a neutron star with a nonuniform surfacetemperature and a low surface magnetic field (the so-called anti-magnetar),similar to three other ccos for which upper limits on period derivative havebeen established. the bolometric luminosity, l_{bol}^\infty \sim 6\times10^{33} erg s^{-1}, estimated from the fits with the hydrogen atmospheremodels, is consistent with the standard neutron star cooling for the cco age of330 yr. the origin of the surface temperature nonuniformity remains to beunderstood; it might be caused by anisotropic heat conduction in the neutronstar crust with very strong toroidal magnetic fields.

1001.0973	quantum nature of cyclotron harmonics in thermal spectra of neutron  stars	some isolated neutron stars show harmonically spaced absorption features intheir thermal soft x-ray spectra. the interpretation of the features as acyclotron line and its harmonics has been suggested, but the usual explanationof the harmonics as caused by relativistic effects fails because therelativistic corrections are extremely small in this case. we suggest that thefeatures correspond to the peaks in the energy dependence of the free-freeopacity in a quantizing magnetic field, known as quantum oscillations. thepeaks arise when the transitions to new landau levels become allowed withincreasing the photon energy; they are strongly enhanced by the square-rootsingularities in the phase-space density of quantum states in the case when thefree (non-quantized) motion is effectively one-dimensional. to exploreobservable properties of these quantum oscillations, we calculate models ofhydrogen neutron star atmospheres with b \sim 10^{10} - 10^{11} g (i.e.,electron cyclotron energy e_{c,e} = 0.1 - 1 kev) and t_{eff} = 1 - 3 mk. suchconditions are thought to be typical for the so-called central compact objectsin supernova remnants, such as 1e 1207.4-5209 in pks 1209-51/52. we show thatobservable features at the electron cyclotron harmonics form at moderatelylarge values of the quantization parameter, b_{eff} = e_{c,e}/kt_{eff} = 0.5 -20. the equivalent widths of the features can reach 100 - 200 ev; they growwith increasing b_{eff} and are lower for higher harmonics.

1002.1109	new x-ray observations of the geminga pulsar wind nebula	previous observations of the middle-aged pulsar geminga with xmm-newton andchandra have shown an unusual pulsar wind nebula (pwn), with a 20" long central(axial) tail directed opposite to the pulsar's proper motion and two 2' long,bent lateral (outer) tails. here we report on a deeper (78 ks) chandraobservation and a few additional xmm-newton observations of the geminga pwn.the new chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up tothree brighter blobs, extends at least 50" (i.e., 0.06 d_{250} pc) from thepulsar. it also allowed us to image the patchy outer tails and the emission inthe immediate vicinity of the pulsar with high resolution. the pwn luminosity,l_{0.3-8 kev} ~ 3\times 10^{29} d_{250}^2 erg/s, is lower than the pulsar'smagnetospheric luminosity by a factor of 10. the spectra of the pwn elementsare rather hard (photon index ~ 1). comparing the two chandra images, we foundevidence of pwn variability, including possible motion of the blobs along theaxial tail. the x-ray pwn is the synchrotron radiation from relativisticparticles of the pulsar wind; its morphology is connected with the supersonicmotion of geminga. we speculate that the outer tails are either (1) a skyprojection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region ofcontact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shearinstability, or (2) polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressurefrom the ism. in the former case, the axial tail may be a jet emanating alongthe pulsar's spin axis, perhaps aligned with the direction of motion. in thelatter case, the axial tail may be the shocked pulsar wind collimated by theram pressure.

0704.2079	x-ray emission from the planet pulsar b1257+12	we report the detection of the millisecond pulsar b1257+12 with the chandrax-ray observatory. in a 20 ks exposure we detected 25 photons from the pulsar,with energies between 0.4 and 2.0 kev, corresponding to the flux f_x=(4.4+/-0.9)*10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in this energy range. the x-ray spectrum canbe described by a power-law model with photon index gamma = 2.8 and luminosityl_x \approx 2.5*10^{29} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--8 kev band, for a plausibledistance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density n_h=3*10^{20} cm^{-2}.alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kt ~ 0.22kev and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. if the thermal x-rays are emittedfrom two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2l_bol ~ 3*10^{29} ergs s^{-1}. we compared our results with the data on other30 millisecond pulsars observed in x-rays and found that the apparent x-rayefficiency of psr b1257+12, l_x/edot ~ 3*10^{-5} for d=500 pc, is lower thanthose of most of millisecond pulsars. this might be explained by an unfavorableorientation of the x-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or bystrong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of thepolar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most partof the pulsar period). alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption ofx-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over afterformation of the planetary system around the pulsar.

1007.2940	optical-uv spectrum and proper motion of the middle-aged pulsar b1055-52	psrb1055-52 is a middle-aged (~535 kyr) radio, x-ray, and gamma-ray pulsarshowing x-ray thermal emission from the neutron star (ns) surface. a candidateoptical counterpart to psrb1055-52 was proposed by mignani and coworkers basedon hubble space telescope (hst) observations performed in 1996, in one spectralband only. we report on hst observations of this field carried out in 2008, infour spectral bands. the astrometric and photometric analyses of these dataconfirm the identification of the proposed candidate as the pulsar's opticalcounterpart. similarly to other middle-aged pulsars, its optical-uv spectrumcan be described by the sum of a power-law (plo) component, presumably emittedfrom the pulsar magnetosphere, and a rayleigh-jeans (rj) component emitted fromthe ns surface. the spectral index of the plo component, alpha_o=1.05+/-0.34,is larger than for other pulsars with optical counterparts. the rj component,with the brightness temperature to=(0.66+/-0.10) d_350**2 r_o,13**-2 mk (whered_350 and r_o,13 are the distance to the pulsar in units of 350 pc and theradius of the emitting area in units of 13 km), shows a factor of 4 excess withrespect to the extrapolation of the x-ray thermal component into theuv-optical. this hints that the rj component is emitted from a larger, colderarea, and suggests that the distance to the pulsar is smaller than previouslythought. from the absolute astrometry of the hst images we measured the pulsarcoordinates with a position accuracy of 0.15". from the comparison withprevious observations we measured the pulsar proper motion, mu = 42+/-5 mas/yr,which corresponds to a transverse velocity v_t = (70+/-8) d_350 km/s.

1010.0125	absorption features in spectra of magnetized neutron stars	the x-ray spectra of some magnetized isolated neutron stars (nss) showabsorption features with equivalent widths (ews) of 50 - 200 ev, whose natureis not yet well known. to explain the prominent absorption features in the softx-ray spectra of the highly magnetized (b ~ 10^{14} g) x-ray dim isolated nss(xdinss), we theoretically investigate different ns local surface models,including naked condensed iron surfaces and partially ionized hydrogen modelatmospheres, with semi-infinite and thin atmospheres above the condensedsurface. we also developed a code for computing light curves and integralemergent spectra of magnetized neutron stars with various temperature andmagnetic field distributions over the ns surface. we compare the generalproperties of the computed and observed light curves and integral spectra forxdins rbs\,1223 and conclude that the observations can be explained by a thinhydrogen atmosphere above the condensed iron surface, while the presence of astrong toroidal magnetic field component on the xdins surface is unlikely. wesuggest that the harmonically spaced absorption features in the soft x-rayspectrum of the central compact object (cco) 1e 1207.4-5209 (hereafter 1e 1207)correspond to peaks in the energy dependence of the free-free opacity in aquantizing magnetic field, known as quantum oscillations. to explore observableproperties of these quantum oscillations, we calculate models of hydrogen nsatmospheres with b ~ 10^{10} - 10^{11} g (i.e., electron cyclotron energye_{c,e} ~ 0.1 - 1 kev) and t_eff = 1 - 3 mk. such conditions are thought to betypical for 1e 1207. we show that observable features at the electron cyclotronharmonics with ews \approx 100 - 200 ev can arise due to these quantumoscillations.

1106.3441	x-ray stripes in tycho's supernova remant: synchrotron footprints of a  nonlinear cosmic ray-driven instability	high-resolution chandra observations of tycho's snr have revealed severalsets of quasi-steady, high-emissivity, nearly-parallel x-ray stripes in somelocalized regions of the snr. these stripes are most likely the result ofcosmic-ray (cr) generated magnetic turbulence at the snr blast wave. however,for the amazingly regular pattern of these stripes to appear requires thesimultaneous action of a number of shock-plasma phenomena and is not predictedby most models of magnetic field amplification. a consistent explanation ofthese stripes yields information on the complex nonlinear plasma processesconnecting efficient cr acceleration and magnetic field fluctuations in strongcollisionless shocks. the nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (nl-dsa) modeldescribed here, which includes magnetic field amplification from a cosmic-raycurrent driven instability, does predict stripes consistent with thesynchrotron emission observations of tycho's snr. we argue that the localambient mean magnetic field geometry determines the orientation of the stripesand therefore it can be reconstructed with the high resolution x-ray imaging.the estimated maximum energy of the cr protons responsible for the stripes is$\sim 10^{15}$\,ev. furthermore, the model predicts that a specific x-raypolarization pattern, with a polarized fraction ~ 50%, accompanies the stripes,which can be tested with future x-ray polarimeter missions.

1111.2346	the spectrum of the recycled psr j0437-4715 and its white dwarf  companion	we present extensive spectral and photometric observations of the recycledpulsar/white-dwarf binary containing psr j0437-4715, which we analyzed togetherwith archival x-ray and gamma-ray data, to obtain the complete mid-infrared togamma-ray spectrum. we first fit each part of the spectrum separately, and thenthe whole multi-wavelength spectrum. we find that the optical-infrared part ofthe spectrum is well fit by a cool white dwarf atmosphere model with purehydrogen composition. the model atmosphere (teff = 3950pm150k, logg=6.98pm0.15, r_wd=(1.9pm0.2)e9 cm) fits our spectral data remarkably well forthe known mass and distance (m=0.25pm0.02msun, d=156.3pm1.3pc), yielding thewhite dwarf age (tau=6.0pm0.5gyr). in the uv, we find a spectral shapeconsistent with thermal emission from the bulk of the neutron star surface,with surface temperature between 1.25e5 and 3.5e5k. the temperature of thethermal spectrum suggests that some heating mechanism operates throughout thelife of the neutron star. the temperature distribution on the neutron starsurface is non-uniform. in the x-rays, we confirm the presence of a high-energytail which is consistent with a continuation of the cut-off power-law component(gamma=1.56pm0.01, ecut=1.1pm0.2gev) that is seen in gamma-rays and perhapseven extends to the near-uv.

1112.3114	twinkling pulsar wind nebulae in the synchrotron cut-off regime and the  gamma-ray flares in the crab nebula	synchrotron radiation of ultra-relativistic particles accelerated in a pulsarwind nebula may dominate its spectrum up to gamma-ray energies. because of theshort cooling time of the gamma-ray emitting electrons, the gamma-ray emissionzone is in the immediate vicinity of the acceleration site. the particleacceleration likely occurs at the termination shock of the relativistic stripedwind, where multiple forced magnetic field reconnections provide strongmagnetic fluctuations facilitating fermi acceleration processes. theacceleration mechanisms imply the presence of stochastic magnetic fields in theparticle acceleration region, which cause stochastic variability of thesynchrotron emission. this variability is particularly strong in the steepgamma-ray tail of the spectrum, where modest fluctuations of the magnetic fieldlead to strong flares of spectral flux. in particular, stochastic variations ofmagnetic field, which may lead to quasi-cyclic gamma-ray flares, can beproduced by the relativistic cyclotron ion instability at the terminationshock. our model calculations of the spectral and temporal evolution ofsynchrotron emission in the spectral cut-off regime demonstrate that theintermittent magnetic field concentrations dominate the gamma-ray emission fromhighest energy electrons and provide fast, strong variability even for aquasi-steady distribution of radiating particles. the simulated light curvesand spectra can explain the very strong gamma-ray flares observed in the crabnebula and the lack of strong variations at other wavelengths. the modelpredicts high polarization in the flare phase, which can be tested with futurepolarimetry observations.

1311.0888	new constraints on the cooling of the central compact object in cas a	to examine the previously claimed fast cooling of the central compact object(cco) in the cas a supernova remnant (snr), we analyzed two chandraobservations of this cco, taken in a setup minimizing instrumental spectraldistortions. we fit the two cco x-ray spectra from 2006 and 2012 with hydrogenand carbon neutron star atmosphere models. the temperature and flux changes inthe 5.5 years between the two epochs depend on the adopted constraints on thefitting parameters and the uncertainties of the effective area calibrations. ifwe allow a change of the equivalent emitting region size, r_em, the effectivetemperature remains essentially the same. if r_em is held constant, thebest-fit temperature change is negative, but its statistical significanceranges from 0.8sigma to 2.5sigma, depending on the model. if we assume that theoptical depth of the acis filter contaminant in 2012 was +/-10% different fromits default calibration value, the significance of the temperature drop becomes0.8sigma to 3.1sigma, for the carbon atmospheres with constant r_em. thus, wedo not see a statistically significant temperature drop in our data, but theinvolved uncertainties are too large to firmly exclude the previously reportedfast cooling. our analysis indicate a decrease of 4%-6% (1.9-2.9sigmasignificance) for the absorbed flux in the energy range 0.6-6kev between 2006and 2012, most prominent in the 1.4-1.8 kev energy range. it could be caused byunaccounted changes of the detector response or contributions from unresolvedsnr material along the line of sight to the cco.

0803.0761	detection of x-ray emission from the very old pulsar j0108-1431	psr j0108-1431 is a nearby, 170 myr old, very faint radio pulsar near the"pulsar death line" in the p-pdot diagram. we observed the pulsar field withthe chandra x-ray observatory and detected a point source (53 counts in a 30 ksexposure, energy flux (9+/-2)\times 10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 0.3-8kev band) close to the radio pulsar position. based on the large x-ray/opticalflux ratio at the x-ray source position, we conclude that the source is thex-ray counterpart of psr j0108-1431.the pulsar spectrum can be described by apower-law model with photon index gamma \approx 2.2 and luminosity l_{0.3-8kev} \sim 2\times 10^{28} d_{130}^2 ergs s^{-1}, or by a blackbody model withthe temperature kt\approx 0.28 kev and bolometric luminosity l_{bol} \sim1.3\times 10^{28} d_{130}^2 ergs s^{-1}, for a plausible hydrogen columndensity nh = 7.3\times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (d_{130}=d/130 pc). the pulsar converts\sim 0.4% of its spin-down power into the x-ray luminosity, i.e., its x-rayefficiency is higher than for most younger pulsars. from the comparison of thex-ray position with the previously measured radio positions, we estimated thepulsar proper motion of 0.2 arcsec yr^{-1} (v_\perp \sim 130 d_{130} kms^{-1}), in the south-southeast direction.

1409.0008	herschel and spitzer observations of slowly rotating, nearby isolated  neutron stars	supernova fallback disks around neutron stars have been discussed toinfluence the evolution of the diverse neutron star populations. slowlyrotating neutron stars are most promising to find such disks. searching for thecold and warm debris of old fallback disks, we carried out herschel pacs (70$\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m) and spitzer irac (3.6 $\mu$m, 4.5 $\mu$m) observations ofeight slowly rotating ($p\approx 3 - 11$ s) nearby ($&lt;1$ kpc) isolated neutronstars. herschel detected 160 $\mu$m emission ($&gt;5\sigma$) at locationsconsistent with the positions of the neutron stars rx j0806.4-4123 and rxj2143.0+0654. no other significant infrared emission was detected from theeight neutron stars. we estimate probabilities of 63%, 33% and 3% that,respectively, none, one, or both herschel pacs 160 $\mu$m detections areunrelated excess sources due to background source confusion or an interstellarcirrus. if the 160 $\mu$m emission is indeed related to cold (10 k to 22 k)dust around the neutron stars, this dust is absorbing and re-emitting $\sim10$% to $\sim 20$% of the neutron stars' x-rays. such high efficiencies wouldbe at least three orders of magnitude larger than the efficiencies of debrisdisks around nondegenerate stars. while thin dusty disks around the neutronstars can be excluded as counterparts of the 160 $\mu$m emission, dustyasteroid belts constitute a viable option.

0805.1041	young energetic psr j1617-5055, its underluminous nebula and  unidentified tev source hess j1616-508	we observed the young energetic pulsar j1617-5055 with the chandra acisdetector for 60 ks. in addition to the pulsar, the x-ray images show a faintpulsar-wind nebula (pwn) seen up to ~1' from the pulsar. deconvolution andreconstruction of the image reveal a brighter compact pwn component of ~1''size, possibly with a jet-torus morphology. the pwn spectrum fits an absorbedpower-law (pl) model with the photon index gamma=1.5. the total pwn luminosityin the 0.5-8 kev band, l_{pwn}=3.2\times10^{33} ergs s^{-1} for d=6.5 kpc, is afraction of 2\times 10^{-4} of the pulsar's spin-down power and a fraction of0.2 of the pulsar's x-ray luminosity, which is a factor of 20 lower than onewould expect from an average empirical relation found for a sample of pwneobserved with chandra. the pulsar's spectrum can be described by an absorbed plwith n_{h}=3.5\times10^{22} cm^{-2} and gamma=1.1, harder than any other pulsarspectrum reliably measured in the soft x-ray band. this non-thermal emission is50% pulsed showing one peak per period. we have also investigated a possibleconnection between j1617 and the extended tev source hess j1616-508 whosecenter is located about 10' west of the pulsar. we find no preferentialextension of the x-ray pwn toward the tev source. therefore, the chandra datado not provide conclusive evidence for psr j1617-5055 and hess j1616-508association. we have also analyzed archival x-ray, radio, and ir data on thehess j1616-508 region and found traces of diffuse emission (resembling a shellin the radio) coinciding with the central part of hess j1616-508. we speculatethat the tev source may be multiple, with most of the emission coming from anunknown snr or a star-forming region, while some fraction of the tev emissionstill may be attributed to the j1617 pwn.

0805.2586	a possible optical counterpart to the old nearby pulsar j0108-1431	the multi-wavelength study of old (&gt;100 myr) radio pulsars holds the key tounderstanding the long-term evolution of neutron stars, including the advancedstages of neutron star cooling and the evolution of the magnetosphere.optical/uv observations are particularly useful for such studies because theyallow one to explore both thermal and non-thermal emission processes. inparticular, studying the optical/uv emission constrains temperature of the bulkof the neutron star surface, too cold to be measured in x-ray observations.aimof this work is to identify the optical counterpart of the very old (166 myr)radio pulsar j0108-1431. we have re-analyzed our original vlt observations(mignani et al. 2003), where a very faint object was tentatively detected closeto the radio position, near the edge of a field galaxy. we found that thebackward extrapolation of the psr j0108-1431 proper motion recently measured bychandra(pavlov et al. 2008) nicely fits the position of this object. based onthat, we propose it as a viable candidate for the optical counterpart to psrj0108-1431. the object fluxes (u =26.4+/-0.3; b =27.9; v &gt;27.8) are consistentwith a thermal spectrum with a brightness temperature of 9x10^4 k (for r = 13km at a distance of 130 pc), emitted from the bulk of the neutron star surface.new optical observations are required to confirm the optical identification ofpsr j0108-1431 and measure its spectrum.

astro-ph;0103171	the x-ray spectrum of the vela pulsar resolved with chandra	we report the results of the spectral analysis of two observations of thevela pulsar with the chandra x-ray observatory. the spectrum of the pulsar doesnot show statistically significant spectral lines in the observed 0.25-8.0 kevband. similar to middle-aged pulsars with detected thermal emission, thespectrum consists of two distinct components. the softer component can bemodeled as a magnetic hydrogen atmosphere spectrum - for the pulsar magneticfield $b=3\times 10^{12}$ g and neutron star mass $m=1.4 m_\odot$ and radius$r^\infty =13$ km, we obtain $\tef^\infty =0.68\pm 0.03$ mk, $l_{\rmbol}^\infty = (2.6\pm 0.2)\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $d=210\pm 20$ pc (theeffective temperature, bolometric luminosity, and radius are as measured by adistant observer). the effective temperature is lower than that predicted bystandard neutron star cooling models. a standard blackbody fit gives $t^\infty=1.49\pm 0.04$ mk, $l_{\rm bol}^\infty=(1.5\pm 0.4)\times 10^{32} d_{250}^2$erg s$^{-1}$ ($d_{250}$ is the distance in units of 250 pc); the blackbodytemperature corresponds to a radius, $r^\infty =(2.1\pm 0.2) d_{250}$ km, muchsmaller than realistic neutron star radii. the harder component can be modeledas a power-law spectrum, with parameters depending on the model adopted for thesoft component - $\gamma=1.5\pm 0.3$, $l_x=(1.5\pm 0.4)\times 10^{31}d_{250}^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\gamma=2.7\pm 0.4$, $l_x=(4.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{31} d_{250}^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the hydrogen atmosphere and blackbody softcomponent, respectively ($\gamma$ is the photon index, $l_x$ is the luminosityin the 0.2--8 kev band). the extrapolation of the power-law component of theformer fit towards lower energies matches the optical flux at $\gamma\simeq1.35$--1.45.

astro-ph;0305510	the variable jet of the vela pulsar	observations of the vela pulsar-wind nebula (pwn) with the chandra x-rayobservatory have revealed a complex, variable pwn structure, including innerand outer arcs, a jet in the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, and acounter-jet in the opposite direction, embedded in diffuse nebular emission.  from the analysis of thirteen chandra observations spread over about 2.5years we found that this outer jet shows particularly strong variability,changing its shape and brightness. we observed bright blobs in the outer jetmoving away from the pulsar with apparent speeds (0.3-0.6)c and fading ontime-scales of days to weeks. the spectrum of the outer jet fits a power-lawmodel with a photon index of 1.3. the x-ray emission of the outer jet can beinterpreted as synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons/positrons.this interpretation allows one to estimate the magnetic field, ~100 microgauss,maximum energy of x-ray emitting electrons, $2 \times 10^{14}$ ev, and energyinjection rate, $8\times 10^{33}$ erg/s, for the outer jet. in the summed pwnimage, we see a faint, strongly bent, extension of the outer jet. the moreextreme bends closer to the pulsar, as well as the apparent side motions of theouter jet, can be associated with kink instabilities of a magneticallyconfined, pinched jet flow. another feature found in the summed image is a dim,2'-long outer counter-jet, which also shows a power-law spectrum with photonindex of 1.2-1.5. southwest of the jet/counter-jet (i.e., approximatelyperpendicular to the direction of pulsar's proper motion), an extended regionof diffuse emission is seen. relativistic particles responsible for thisradiation are apparently supplied by the outer jet.

astro-ph;0306177	the jets of the vela pulsar	chandra observations of the vela pulsar-wind nebula (pwn) have revealed a jetin the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, and a counter-jet in theopposite direction, embedded in diffuse nebular emission. the jet consists of abright, 8''-long inner jet, between the pulsar and the outer arc, and a dim,curved outer jet that extends up to 100'' in approximately the same direction.  from the analysis of thirteen chandra observations spread over about 2.5years we found that this outer jet shows particularly strong variability,changing its shape and brightness. we observed bright blobs in the outer jetmoving away from the pulsar with apparent speeds (0.3-0.6)c and fading ontime-scales of days to weeks. the spectrum of the outer jet fits a power-lawmodel with a photon index of 1.3\pm0.1. the x-ray emission of the outer jet canbe interpreted as synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativisticelectrons/positrons. this interpretation allows one to estimate the magneticfield, ~100 microgauss, maximum energy of x-ray emitting electrons, ~2\times10^{14} ev, and energy injection rate, ~8\times 10^{33} erg/s, for the outerjet. in the summed pwn image we see a dim, 2'-long outer counter-jet, whichalso shows a power-law spectrum with photon ined of 1.2-1.5. southwest of thejet/counter-jet an extended region of diffuse emission is seen. relativisticparticles responsible for this radiation are apparently supplied by the outerjet.

astro-ph;0403287	spatial variation of the x-ray spectrum of the crab nebula	we present spectral analysis of the crab nebula obtained with the {\itchandra} x-ray observatory. the x-ray spectrum is characterized by a power-lawwhose index varies across the nebula. the variation can be discussed in termsof the particle injection from the pulsar in two different directions: theequatorial plane containing the torus and the symmetry axis along the jet. inthe equatorial plane, spectra within the torus are the hardest, with photonindex $\alpha \approx 1.9$, and are almost independent of the surfacebrightness. at the periphery of the torus, the spectrum gradually softens inthe outer, lower surface brightness regions, up to $\alpha \approx 3.0$. thisindicates that synchrotron losses become significant to x-ray emittingparticles at the outer boundary of the torus. we discuss the nature of thetorus, incorporating information from observations at other wavelengths.spectral variations are also seen within the southern jet. the core of the jetis the hardest with $\alpha \approx$ 2.0, and the outer sheath surrounding thecore becomes softer with $\alpha$ up to 2.5 at the outermost part. based on thesimilarity between the spectra of the jet core and the torus, we suggest thatthe electron spectra of the particles injected from the pulsar are also similarin these two different directions. the brightness ratio between the near andfar sides of the torus can be explained by doppler boosting and relativisticaberration; however, the observed ratio cannot be derived from the standardweakly magnetized pulsar wind model. we also found a site where an opticalfilament comprised of supernova ejecta is absorbing the soft x-ray emission($&lt;$ 2 kev).

astro-ph;0405212	x-ray emission from the old pulsar b0950+08	we present the timing and spectral analyses of thexmm-newton data on the17-myr-old, nearby radio pulsar b0950+08. this observation revealed pulsationsof the x-ray flux of the pulsar at its radio period. the pulse shape and pulsedfraction are apparently different at lower and higher energies of the observed0.2-10 kev energy range, which suggests that the radiation cannot be explainedby a single emission mechanism. the x-ray spectrum of the pulsar can be fittedwith a power-law model with a photon index about 1.75 and an (isotropic)luminosity about 9.8e29 erg/s in the 0.2-10 kev. better fits are obtained withtwo-component, power-law plus thermal, models with index of 1.30 and 9.7e29erg/s for the power-law component that presumably originates from the pulsar'smagnetosphere. the thermal component, dominating at e&gt;0.7 kev, can beinterpreted as radiation from heated polar caps on the neutron star surfacecovered with a hydrogen atmosphere. the inferred effective temperature, radius,and bolometric luminosity of the polar caps are about 1 mk, 250 m, and 3e29erg/s. optical through x-ray nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar can be describedas a single power-law with index 1.3-1.4 for the two-component x-ray fit. theratio of the nonthermal x-ray (1-10 kev) luminosity to the nonthermal optical(4000-9000 \aa) luminosity is within the range of 1e2-1e3 observed for youngerpulsars, which suggests that the magnetospheric x-ray and optical emissions arepowered by the same mechanism in all pulsars. an upper limit on the temperatureof the bulk of the neutron star surface, inferred from the optical and x-raydata, is about 0.15 mk. we also analyze x-ray observations of several other oldpulsars, b2224+65, j2043+2740, b0628-28, b1813-36, b1929+10, and b0823+26.

astro-ph;0502076	ultraviolet, x-ray, and optical radiation from the geminga pulsar	we observed the gamma-ray pulsar geminga with the hst stis/mama detectors tomeasure the geminga's uv spectrum and pulsations. the slope of the far-uv (fuv)spectrum is close to that of a rayleigh-jeans spectrum, suggesting that the fuvradiation is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star (ns) surface.the measured fuv flux, f_fuv=(3.7+/-0.2)x10^-15 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 in 1155-1702 aband, corresponds to a brightness temperature t_rj=(0.3-0.4)(d_200/r_13)^2 mk.the soft thermal component of the geminga's x-ray spectrum measured with thexmm-newton observatory corresponds to a temperature t_s=0.49+/-0.01 mk andradius r_s = (12.9+/-1.0)d_200 km. unlike other nss detected in the uv-optical,the fuv spectrum of geminga lies below the extrapolation of the soft thermalcomponent, which might be associated with the geminga's very low temperature.surprisingly, the thermal fuv radiation is strongly pulsed, showing a narrowdip at a phase close to that of a broader minimum of the soft x-ray lightcurve. the strong pulsations might be attributed to partial occultations of thethermal uv radiation by regions of the magnetosphere filled withelectron/positron plasma. in contrast with the fuv spectrum, the near-ir (nir)through near-uv (nuv) spectrum of geminga is clearly nonthermal. it can bedescribed by a power-law model, f_nu \propto nu^{-alpha} with a slope alpha =0.43+/-0.15, close to alpha = 0.56+/-0.24 of the hard x-ray (e&gt;2.5 kev)magnetospheric component. the observed nir-optical-nuv spectrum is marginallyconsistent with the extrapolation of the x-ray magnetospheric spectrum. the nuvpulsations, however, do not show a clear correlation with the hard x-raypulsations.

astro-ph;9604072	model neutron star atmospheres with low magnetic fields. 1. atmospheres  in radiative equilibrium	we present a detailed investigation of neutron star atmospheres with lowmagnetic fields, $b &lt; 10^8 -10^{10}$ g, which do not affect opacities andequation of state of the atmospheric matter. we compute the atmosphericstructure, emergent spectral fluxes and specific intensities for hydrogen,helium and iron atmospheres in a wide domain of effective temperatures andgravitational accelerations expected for neutron stars. the iron atmospheresare computed with the opacities and equations of state from the opal opacitylibrary. we show that the model atmosphere spectra are substantially differentfrom the blackbody spectra. for light element atmospheres, the flux is greaterthan the blackbody flux, and the spectrum is harder, at high photon energies,whereas at low energies the spectral flux follows the rayleigh-jeans law with a(surface) temperature lower than the effective temperature. the spectra of ironatmospheres display prominent spectral features in the soft x-ray range. theemergent specific intensity is anisotropic, with the anisotropy depending onenergy. these properties of the atmospheric radiation should be taken intoaccount for the proper interpretation of the thermal component of the neutronstar radiation detectable at x-ray through uv energies. in particular, fittingof the thermal component with the blackbody model may result in substantiallyincorrect parameters of the radiating regions. we discuss an application of ouratmosphere models to the nearby millisecond pulsar psr j0437-4715.

astro-ph;9609097	multiwavelength observations of isolated neutron stars as a tool to  probe the properties of their surfaces	we show that an analysis of multiwavelength observations of isolated neutronstars based on neutron star atmosphere models can be used not only to evaluatethe neutron star effective temperature, but also to determine chemicalcomposition of its surface. to demonstrate how this new method can be appliedto a specific object, we chose the old isolated neutron star candidaterxj1856.5-3754, whose soft x-ray radiation has been studied recently by walteret al. (1996). we fitted the soft x-ray spectrum of this object with neutronstar atmosphere models of different chemical compositions and used these fitsto calculate the source spectrum over a broad wavelength range. we showed, inparticular, that the optical/uv flux expected from this object dependsdrastically on the composition of its surface. in particular, the neutron starcovered with hydrogen would be 5-6 magnitudes brighter than the neutron starwith an iron surface. the object should also be observable with $euve$; the euvflux is expected to be almost twice higher for the iron surface than for thehydrogen one. thus, multiwavelength observations of this object would enableone to examine, for the first time, chemical composition of the neutron starsurface. the method proposed can be applied to other nearby isolated neutronstars.

astro-ph;9702004	photoionization of hydrogen in atmospheres of magnetic neutron stars	the strong magnetic fields (b ~ 10^{12} - 10^{13} g) characteristic ofneutron stars make all the properties of an atom strongly dependent on thetransverse component k_\perp of its generalized momentum. in particular, thephotoionization process is modified substantially: (i) threshold energies aredecreased as compared with those for an atom at rest, (ii) cross section valuesare changed significantly, and (iii) selection rules valid for atoms at restare violated by the motion so that new photoionization channels become allowed.to calculate the photoionization cross sections, we, for the first time, employexact numerical treatment of both initial and final atomic states. this enablesus to take into account the quasi-bound (autoionizing) atomic states as well ascoupling of different ionization channels. we extend the previousconsideration, restricted to the so-called centered states corresponding torelatively small values of k_\perp, to arbitrary states of atomic motion. wefold the cross sections with the thermal distribution of atoms over k. fortypical temperatures of neutron star atmospheres, the averaged cross sectionsdiffer substantially from those of atoms at rest. in particular, thephotoionization edges are strongly broadened by the thermal motion of atoms;this "magnetic broadening" exceeds the usual doppler broadening by orders ofmagnitude. the decentered states of the atoms give rise to the low-energycomponent of the photoionization cross section. this new component growssignificantly with increasing temperature above 10^{5.5} k and decreasingdensity below 1 g/cm^3, i.e., for the conditions expected in atmospheres ofmiddle-aged neutron stars.

astro-ph;9912024	the compact central object in cas a: a neutron star with hot polar caps  or a black hole?	the central pointlike x-ray source of the cas a supernova remnant wasdiscovered in the chandra first light observation and found later in thearchival rosat and einstein images. the analysis of these data does not showstatistically significant variability of the source. the power-law fit yieldsthe photon index 2.6-4.1, and luminosity (2-60)e34 erg/s, for d=3.4 kpc. thepower-law index is higher, and the luminosity lower, than those observedfromvery young pulsars. one can fit the spectrum equally well with a blackbodymodel with t=6-8 mk, r=0.2-0.5 km, l=(1.4-1.9)e33 erg/s. the inferred radii aretoo small, and the temperatures too high, for the radiationcould be interpretedas emitted from the whole surface of a uniformly heated neutron star. fits withthe neutron star atmosphere models increase the radius and reduce thetemperature, but these parameters are still substantially different from thoseexpected for a young neutron star. one cannot exclude, however, that theobserved emission originates from hot spots on a cooler neutron star surface.because of strong interstellar absorption, the possible low-temperaturecomponent gives a small contribution to the observed spectrum; an upper limiton the (gravitationally redshifted) surface temperature is &lt; 1.9-2.3 mk.amongst several possible interpretations, we favor a model of a stronglymagnetized neutron star with magnetically confined hydrogen or helium polarcaps on a cooler iron surface. alternatively, the observed radiation may beinterpreted as emitted by a compact object (more likely, a black hole)accreting from a fossil disk or from a late-type dwarf in a close binary.

atom-ph;9605001	ionization of the hydrogen atom in strong magnetic fields: beyond the  adiabatic approximation	high magnetic fields in neutron stars, b ~ 10^{11} - 10^{13} g, substantiallymodify the properties of atoms and their interaction with radiation. inparticular, the photoionization cross section becomes anisotropic and stronglypolarization dependent. in a number of previous works based on the adiabaticapproximation the conclusion was drawn that the transverse cross sectionvanishes for frequencies smaller than the electron cyclotron frequency. inother works (which employed a different form of the interaction operator)appreciable finite values were obtained. an adequate interpretation of theneutron star thermal-like radiation requires a resolution of this controversy.  in this work the atomic wave functions for both discrete and continuum statesare calculated by solving the coupled channel equations allowing the admixturebetween different landau levels, which provides much higher accuracy than theadiabatic approximation. this enables to resolve the above contradiction infavour of the finite transverse cross sections. the non-adiabatic treatment ofthe continuum includes coupling between closed and open channels, which leadsto the autoionization of quasi-bound energy levels associated with the electroncyclotron excitations and gives rise to beutler - fano resonances of thephotoionization cross section. autoionization widths of these quasi-boundlevels are calculated and compared with the radiative widths. the results areimportant for investigations of the radiation emergent from the surface layersof neutron stars.
