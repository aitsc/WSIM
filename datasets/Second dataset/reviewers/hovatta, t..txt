0910.2607	long-term variability of radio-bright bl lacertae objects	radio-bright bl lacertae objects (blos) are typically variable and exhibitprominent flaring. we use a sample of 24 blos to get a clear idea of theirflaring behavior and to find possible commonalities in their variabilitypatterns. our goal was to compare the results given by computational timescales and the observed variability parameters determined directly from theflux curves. also, we wanted to find out if the blo flares adhere to thegeneralized shock model. we use long-term monitoring data from 4.8, 8, 14.5,22, 37, 90 and 230 ghz. the structure function, discrete correlation functionand lomb-scargle periodogram time scales, calculated in a previous study, areanalyzed in more detail. we determine flare durations, rise and decay times,absolute and relative peak fluxes from the monitoring data. we find that blosdemonstrate a wide range of variability behavior. blos include sources withfast and strong variability, such as oj 287, pks 1749+096 and bl lac, but alsosources with more rolling fluctuations like pks 0735+178. the most extremeflares can last for up to 13 years or have peak fluxes of approximately 12 jyin the observer's frame. when the doppler boosting effect is taken intoaccount, the peak flux of a flare does not depend on the duration of the flare.a rough analysis of the time lags and peak flux evolution indicates that bloflares in the mm - cm wavelengths are high-peaking, i.e., are in the adiabaticstage. thus, the results concur with the generalized shock model.

0911.4924	relativistic beaming and gamma-ray brightness of blazars	we investigate the dependence of gamma-ray brightness of blazars on intrinsicproperties of their parsec-scale radio jets and the implication forrelativistic beaming. by combining apparent jet speeds derived fromhigh-resolution vlba images from the mojave program with millimetre-wavelengthflux density monitoring data from metsahovi radio observatory, we estimate thejet doppler factors, lorentz factors, and viewing angles for a sample of 62blazars. we study the trends in these quantities between the sources which weredetected in gamma-rays by the fermi large area telescope (lat) during its firstthree months of science operations and those which were not detected. thelat-detected blazars have on average higher doppler factors thannon-lat-detected blazars, as has been implied indirectly in several earlierstudies. we find statistically significant differences in the viewing angledistributions between gamma-ray bright and weak sources. most interestingly,gamma-ray bright blazars have a distribution of comoving frame viewing anglesthat is significantly narrower than that of gamma-ray weak blazars and centredroughly perpendicular to the jet axis. the lack of gamma-ray bright blazars atlarge comoving frame viewing angles can be explained by relativistic beaming ofgamma-rays, while the apparent lack of gamma-ray bright blazars at smallcomoving frame viewing angles, if confirmed with larger samples, may suggest anintrinsic anisotropy or lorentz factor dependence of the gamma-ray emission.

1002.1020	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. iii. eighteen months of agile  monitoring of the "crazy diamond"	we report on 18 months of multiwavelength observations of the blazar 3c 454.3(crazy diamond) carried out in july 2007-january 2009. we show the results ofthe agile campaigns which took place on may-june 2008, july-august 2008, andoctober 2008-january 2009. during the may 2008-january 2009 period, the sourceaverage flux was highly variable, from an average gamma-ray flux f(e&gt;100mev) &gt;200e-8 ph/cm2/s in may-june 2008, to f(e&gt;100mev)~80e-8 ph/cm2/s in october2008-january 2009. the average gamma-ray spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev canbe fit by a simple power law (gamma_grid ~ 2.0 to 2.2). only 3-sigma upperlimits can be derived in the 20-60 kev energy band with super-agile. duringjuly-august 2007 and may-june 2008, rxte measured a flux of f(3-20 kev)=8.4e-11 erg/cm2/s, and f(3-20 kev)=4.5e-11 erg/cm2/s, respectively and aconstant photon index gamma_pca=1.65. swift/xrt observations were carried outduring all agile campaigns, obtaining a f(2-10 kev)=(0.9-7.5)e-11 erg/cm2/s anda photon index gamma_xrt=1.33-2.04. bat measured an average flux of ~5 mcrab.gasp-webt monitored 3c 454.3 during the whole 2007-2008 period from the radioto the optical. a correlation analysis between the optical and the gamma-rayfluxes shows a time lag of tau=-0.4 days. an analysis of 15 ghz and 43 ghz vlbicore radio flux observations shows an increasing trend of the core radio flux,anti- correlated with the higher frequency data. the modeling seds, and thebehavior of the long-term light curves in different energy bands, allow us tocompare the jet properties during different emission states, and to study thegeometrical properties of the jet on a time-span longer than one year.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1109.5844	correlation between fermi/lat gamma-ray and 37 ghz radio properties of  northern agn averaged over 11 months	although the fermi mission has increased our knowledge of gamma-ray agn, manyquestions remain, such as the site of gamma-ray production, the emissionmechanism, and the factors that govern the strength of the emission. using datafrom a high radio band, 37 ghz, uncontaminated by other radiation componentsbesides the jet emission, we study these questions with averaged flux densitiesover the the first year of fermi operations. we look for possible correlationsbetween the 100 mev - 100 gev band used by the fermi satellite and 37 ghz radioband observed at the aalto university metsahovi radio telescope, as well as fordifferences between the gamma-ray emission of different agn subsamples. we usedata averaged over the 1fgl period. our sample includes 249 northern agn,including a complete sample of 68 northern agn with a measured average fluxdensity exceeding 1 jy. we find significant correlation between both the fluxdensities and luminosities in gamma and radio bands. the fermi luminosity isinversely correlated with the peak frequency of the synchrotron component ofthe agn spectral energy distributions. we also calculate the gamma dominances,defined as the ratio between the gamma and radio flux densities, and find anindication that high-energy blazars are more gamma-dominated than low-energyblazars. after studying the distributions of gamma and radio luminosities, itis clear that bl lacertae objects are different from quasars, withsignificantly lower luminosities. it is unclear whether this is an intrinsicdifference, an effect of variable relativistic boosting across the synchrotronpeak frequency range, or the result of fermi being more sensitive to hardspectrum sources like bl lacertae objects. our results suggest that the gammaradiation is produced co-spatially with the 37 ghz emission, i.e., in the jet.

1205.0490	faraday rotation in the mojave blazars: connection with gamma-ray  studies	we have conducted a survey of faraday rotation in a sample of 191 compactradio-loud agns as part of the mojave (monitoring of jets in active galacticnuclei with vlba experiments) project. the observations were carried out withthe vlba at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 ghz over 12 epochs in 2006. we detectsufficiently strong linear polarization in 159 out of 211 observations tocalculate the rotation measure values, resulting in a large enough sample forstatistical analysis of the faraday rotation in blazars. these faraday rotationmeasures can be used to study the intrinsic magnetic field order andorientation in parsec-scale blazar jets. our sample includes 119 sources listedin the 1fgl or 2fgl catalogs and we detect rotation measure values in 111 outof 131 maps. of the 72 sources that are not in the gamma-ray catalogs we detectrm in 48 out of 80 maps. the median rm values of the lat-detected sources donot differ significantly from the non-lat-detected sources. nine of the sourcesin our sample have resolved enough jets to study the transverse faradayrotation structure, and we detect significant transverse rotation measuregradients in four sources. in two of these (3c~273 and 3c~454.3) there isadditional evidence to support helical magnetic field in the parsec-scale jets.the two others (0923+392 and 2230+114) require further observations to identifythe nature of the gradient. it is interesting that three of the four sourceswith significant rotation measure gradients are sources that have shown largegamma-ray flares.

1205.6746	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. viii. faraday rotation in parsec-scale agn jets	we report observations of faraday rotation measures (rms) for a sample of 191extragalactic radio jets observed within the mojave program. multifrequencyvlba observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at fourfrequencies between 8 and 15 ghz. we detect parsec-scale faraday rms in 149sources and find the quasars to have larger rms on average than bl lac objects.the median core rms are significantly higher than in the jet components. thisis especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negativecorrelation between the magnitude of the rm and the de-projected distance fromthe core. we perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of totalintensity, polarization and faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors oftransverse faraday rm gradients in unresolved jets. our simulations show thatthe finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observedrm gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if thejet is less than two beams wide in polarization. we detect significanttransverse rm gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and2251+158). in 1226+023 the rm is for the first time seen to change sign frompositive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of ahelical magnetic field in the jet. in this source we also detect variations inthe jet rm over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explainwith external faraday screens and suggest internal faraday rotation. bycomparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the fourfrequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely randomfaraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of ourpolarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,internal faraday rotation is needed.

1305.6005	vlba observations of a rare multiple quasar imaging event caused by  refraction in the interstellar medium	we report on the first detection of the theoretically-predicted rarephenomenon of multiple parsec-scale imaging of an active galactic nucleusinduced by refractive effects due to localized foreground electron densityenhancements, e.g., in an au-scale plasma lens(es) in the ionized component ofthe galactic interstellar medium. we detected multiple imaging in the lowgalactic latitude (b=-2 deg) quasar 2023+335 from the 15.4 ghz mojaveobservations when the source was undergoing an ese. while the parsec-scale jetof the source normally extends along pa -20 deg, in the 28 may 2009 and 23 july2009 images a highly significant multi-component pattern of secondary images isstretched out nearly along the constant galactic latitude line with a local pa40 deg, indicating that the direction of relative motion of the plasma lens isclose to orbital. weaker but still detectable imaging patterns at similarposition angles are sporadically manifest at several other epochs. modeling theese that occurred in early 2009 and lasted ~0.14 yr, we determined that theforeground screen has a double-lens structure, with proper motion (~6.8mas/yr), and angular size (~0.27 mas). we also found that the angularseparation between the two brightest sub-images roughly follows awavelength-squared dependence expected from plasma scattering. furthermore, byanalyzing archival non-simultaneous vlba observations covering a wide frequencyrange from 1.4 to 86 ghz, we found that the scattered angular size of the vlbicore follows a $\nu^{-1.89}$ dependence, implying the presence of a turbulent,refractive dominated scattering screen that has a confined structure or istruncated transverse to the line of sight toward 2023+335.

1308.3709	multifrequency studies of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513 was first detected by the largearea telescope (lat) on-board fermi in 2011 june-july when it underwent aperiod of flaring activity. since then, as fermi continues to accumulate dataon this source, its flux has been monitored on a daily basis. two furthergamma-ray flaring episodes from sbs 0846+513 were observed in 2012 may andaugust, reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 mev of (50+/-12)x10^-8ph/cm^2/s, and (73+/-14)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s on may 24 and august 7, respectively.three outbursts were detected at 15 ghz by the owens valley radio observatory40-m telescope in 2012 may, 2012 october, and 2013 january, suggesting acomplex connection with the gamma-ray activity. the most likely scenariosuggests that the 2012 may gamma-ray flare may not be directly related to theradio activity observed over the same period, while the two gamma-ray flaringepisodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz in 2012october and 2013 january. the gamma-ray flare in 2012 may triggered swiftobservations that confirmed that sbs 0846+513 was also exhibiting high activityin the optical, uv and x-ray bands, thus providing a firm identificationbetween the gamma-ray source and the lower-energy counterpart. we compared thespectral energy distribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2012 may with thatof a quiescent state. the two seds, modelled as an external compton componentof seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the electrondistribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. no significant evidenceof thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed. interestingly,in the 5 ghz radio luminosity vs. synchrotron peak frequency plot sbs 0846+513seems to lie in the flat spectrum radio quasar part of the so-called `blazarsequence'.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1311.3304	the robopol optical polarization survey of gamma-ray - loud blazars	we present first results from robopol, a novel-design optical polarimeteroperating at the skinakas observatory in crete. the data, taken during the may- june 2013 commissioning of the instrument, constitute a single-epoch linearpolarization survey of a sample of gamma-ray - loud blazars, defined accordingto unbiased and objective selection criteria, easily reproducible insimulations, as well as a comparison sample of, otherwise similar, gamma-ray -quiet blazars. as such, the results of this survey are appropriate for bothphenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical populationmodels. we have measured polarization fractions as low as $0.015$ down to $r$magnitude of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. the hypothesis thatthe polarization fractions of gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazarsare drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the $10^{-3}$ level. wetherefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources havedifferent optical polarization properties. this is the first time thisstatistical difference is demonstrated in optical wavelengths. the polarizationfraction distributions of both samples are well-described by exponentialdistributions with averages of $\langle p \rangle =6.4 ^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\times10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--loud blazars, and $\langle p \rangle =3.2^{+2.0}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--quiet blazars. the most probablevalue for the difference of the means is $3.4^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\times 10^{-2}$. thedistribution of polarization angles is statistically consistent with beinguniform.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1401.0538	connection between optical and gamma-ray variability in blazars	we use optical data from the palomar transient factory (ptf) and the catalinareal-time transient survey (crts) to study the variability of gamma-raydetected and non-detected objects in a large population of active galacticnuclei (agn) selected from the candidate gamma-ray blazar survey and fermigamma-ray space telescope catalogs. our samples include 714 sources with ptfdata and 1244 sources with crts data. we calculate the intrinsic modulationindex to quantify the optical variability amplitude in these samples. we findthe gamma-ray detected objects to be more variable than the non-detected ones.the flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) are more variable than the bl lacobjects in our sample, but the significance of the difference depends on thesample used. when dividing the objects based on their synchrotron peakfrequency, we find the low synchrotron peaked (lsp) objects to be significantlymore variable than the high synchrotron peaked (hsp) ones, explaining thedifference between the fsrqs and bl lacs. this could be due to the lsps beingobserved near their electron energy peak, while in the hsps the emission iscaused by lower energy electrons, which cool more slowly. we also find asignificant correlation between the optical and gamma-ray fluxes that isstronger in the hsp bl lacs than in the fsrqs. the fsrqs in our sample are alsomore compton dominated than the hsp bl lacs. these findings are consistent withmodels where the gamma-ray emission of hsp objects is produced by thesynchrotron self-compton mechanism, while the lsp objects need an additionalexternal compton component that increases the scatter in the flux-fluxcorrelation.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

1404.0014	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. xi. spectral distributions	we have obtained milliarcsecond-scale spectral index distributions for asample of 190 extragalactic radio jets through the mojave project. the sourceswere observed in 2006 at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1, and 15.4 ghz, and we study thefour-frequency spectrum in individual jet features. we performed detailedsimulations to study the effects of image alignment and (u,v)-plane coverage onthe spectral index maps to verify our results. the core spectral indices are onaverage flat, while the jet spectrum is in general steep with a mean index of-1.04. a simple power-law fit is often inadequate for the core regions, asexpected if the cores are partially self-absorbed. the overall jet spectrumsteepens at a rate of about -0.001 to -0.004 per deprojected parsec when movingfurther out from the core with flat spectrum radio quasars having significantlysteeper spectra than the bl lac objects. the spectrum in both types of objectsflattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particleacceleration or density enhancements along the jet. the mean spectral index atthe component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 forthe electron energy distribution. we find a significant trend that jetcomponents with linear polarization parallel to the jet (magnetic fieldperpendicular to the jet) have flatter spectra, as expected for transverseshocks. compared to quasars, bl lacs have more jet components withperpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generallyflatter spectra. the overall steepening of the spectra with distance can beexplained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with theevolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets areconical. this interpretation is supported by a significant correlation with theage of the component and the spectral index, with older components havingsteeper spectra.

1404.0976	studies of the jet in bl lacertae i. recollimation shock and moving  emission features	parsec-scale vlba images of bl lac at 15 ghz show that the jet contains apermanent quasi-stationary emission feature 0.26 mas (0.34 pc projected) fromthe core, along with numerous moving features. in projection, the tracks of themoving features cluster around an axis at position angle -166.6 deg thatconnects the core with the standing feature. the moving features appear toemanate from the standing feature in a manner strikingly similar to the resultsof numerical 2-d relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (rmhd) simulations in whichmoving shocks are generated at a recollimation shock. because of this, and theclose analogy to the jet feature hst-1 in m87, we identify the standing featurein bl lac as a recollimation shock. we assume that the magnetic field dominatesthe dynamics in the jet, and that the field is predominantly toroidal. fromthis we suggest that the moving features are compressions established by slowand fast mode magneto-acoustic mhd waves. we illustrate the situation with asimple model in which the slowest moving feature is a slow-mode wave, and thefastest feature is a fast-mode wave. in the model the beam has lorentz factorabout 3.5 in the frame of the host galaxy, and the fast mode wave has lorentzfactor about 1.6 in the frame of the beam. this gives a maximum apparent speedfor the moving features 10c. in this model the lorentz factor of the pattern inthe galaxy frame is approximately 3 times larger than that of the beam itself.

0803.0654	blazar sequence - an artefact of doppler boosting	the blazar sequence is a scenario in which the bolometric luminosity of theblazar governs the appearance of its spectral energy distribution. the mostprominent result is the significant negative correlation between thesynchrotron peak frequencies and the synchrotron peak luminosities of theblazar population. observational studies of the blazar sequence have, ingeneral, neglected the effect of doppler boosting. we study the dependence ofboth the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity with doppler-correctedquantities. we determine the spectral energy distributions of 135 radio-brightagn and find the best-fit parabolic function for the distribution to quantifytheir synchrotron emission. the corresponding measurements of synchrotron peakluminosities and frequencies are doppler-corrected with a new set of dopplerfactors calculated from variability data. the relevant correlations for theblazar sequence are determined for these intrinsic quantities. the dopplerfactor depends strongly on the synchrotron peak frequency, the lower energysources being more boosted. applying the doppler correction to the peakfrequencies and luminosities annuls the negative correlation between the twoquantities, which becomes positive. for bl lacertae objects, the positivecorrelation is particularly strong. the blazar sequence, when defined as theanticorrelation between the peak frequency and luminosity of the synchrotroncomponent of the spectral energy distribution, disappears when the intrinsic,doppler-corrected values are used. it is an observational phenomenon created byvariable doppler boosting across the synchrotron peak frequency range.

1408.6264	time-correlation between the radio and gamma-ray activity in blazars and  the production site of the gamma-ray emission	in order to determine the location of the gamma-ray emission site in blazars,we investigate the time-domain relationship between their radio and gamma-rayemission. light-curves for the brightest detected blazars from the first 3years of the mission of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope arecross-correlated with 4 years of 15ghz observations from the ovro 40-mmonitoring program. the large sample and long light-curve duration enable us tocarry out a statistically robust analysis of the significance of thecross-correlations, which is investigated using monte carlo simulationsincluding the uneven sampling and noise properties of the light-curves.modeling the light-curves as red noise processes with power-law power spectraldensities, we find that only one of 41 sources with high quality data in bothbands shows correlations with significance larger than 3-sigma (ao 0235+164),with only two more larger than even 2.25-sigma (pks 1502+106 and b2 2308+34).additionally, we find correlated variability in mrk 421 when including a strongflare that occurred in july-september 2012. these results demonstrate veryclearly the difficulty of measuring statistically robust multiwavelengthcorrelations and the care needed when comparing light-curves even when manyyears of data are used. this should be a caution. in all four sources the radiovariations lag the gamma-ray variations, suggesting that the gamma-ray emissionoriginates upstream of the radio emission. continuous simultaneous monitoringover a longer time period is required to obtain high significance levels incross-correlations between gamma-ray and radio variability in most blazars.

1411.0334	the connection between the 15 ghz radio and gamma-ray emission in  blazars	since mid-2007 we have carried out a dedicated long-term monitoring programmeat 15 ghz using the owens valley radio observatory 40 meter telescope. one ofthe main goals of this programme is to study the relation between the radio andgamma-ray emission in blazars and to use it as a tool to locate the site ofhigh energy emission. using this large sample of objects we are able tocharacterize the radio variability, and study the significance of correlationsbetween the radio and gamma-ray bands. we find that the radio variability ofmany sources can be described using a simple power law power spectral density,and that when taking into account the red-noise characteristics of the lightcurves, cases with significant correlation are rare. we note that whilesignificant correlations are found in few individual objects, radio variationsare most often delayed with respect to the gamma-ray variations. this suggeststhat the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission. becausestrong flares in most known gamma-ray-loud blazars are infrequent, longer lightcurves are required to settle the issue of the strength of radio-gammacross-correlations and establish confidently possible delays between the two.for this reason continuous multiwavelength monitoring over a longer time periodis essential for statistical tests of jet emission models.

1501.07407	a combined radio and gev gamma-ray view of the 2012 and 2013 flares of  mrk 421	in 2012 markarian 421 underwent the largest flare ever observed in thisblazar at radio frequencies. in the present study, we start exploring thisunique event and compare it to a less extreme event in 2013. we use 15 ghzradio data obtained with the owens valley radio observatory 40-m telescope, 95ghz millimeter data from the combined array for research in millimeter-waveastronomy, and gev gamma-ray data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. theradio light curves during the flaring periods in 2012 and 2013 have verydifferent appearances, both in shape and peak flux density. assuming that theradio and gamma-ray flares are physically connected, we attempt to model themost prominent sub-flares of the 2012 and 2013 activity periods by using thesimplest possible theoretical framework. we first fit a one-zone synchrotronself-compton (ssc) model to the less extreme 2013 flare and estimate parametersdescribing the emission region. we then model the major gamma-ray and radioflares of 2012 using the same framework. the 2012 gamma-ray flare shows twodistinct spikes of similar amplitude, so we examine scenarios associating theradio flare with each spike in turn. in the first scenario, we cannot explainthe sharp radio flare with a simple ssc model, but we can accommodate this byadding plausible time variations to the doppler beaming factor. in the secondscenario, a varying doppler factor is not needed, but the ssc model parametersrequire fine tuning. both alternatives indicate that the sharp radio flare, ifphysically connected to the preceding gamma-ray flares, can be reproduced onlyfor a very specific choice of parameters.

1502.00934	long-term ovro monitoring of lsi+61303: confirmation of the two close  periodicities	context: the gamma-ray binary lsi+61303 shows multiple periodicities. thetiming analysis of 6.7 yr of gbi radio data and of 6 yr of fermi-lat gevgamma-ray data both have found two close periodicities p1(gbi) = 26.49 \pm 0.07d, p2(gbi)=26.92 \pm 0.07 d and p1(gamma)=26.48 \pm 0.08 d, p2(gamma) = 26.99\pm 0.08 d. aims: the system lsi+61303 is the object of several continuousmonitoring programs at low and high energies. the frequency difference betweenf1 and f2 of only 0.0006 d(-1) requires long-term monitoring because thefrequency resolution in timing analysis is related to the inverse of theoverall time interval. the owens valley radio observatory (ovro) 40 m telescopehas been monitoring the source at 15 ghz for five years and overlaps withfermi-lat monitoring. the aim of this work is to establish whether the twofrequencies are also resolved in the ovro monitoring. methods: we analysed ovrodata with the lomb-scargle method. we also updated the timing analysis offermi-lat observations. results: the periodograms of ovro data confirm the twoperiodicities p1(ovro) = 26.5 \pm 0.1 d and p2(ovro) = 26.9 \pm 0.1 d.conclusions: the three indipendent measurements of p1 and p2 with gbi, ovro,and fermi-lat observations confirm that the periodicities are permanentfeatures of the system lsi+61303. the similar behaviours of the emission athigh (gev) and low (radio) energy when the compact object in lsi+61303 istoward apastron suggest that the emission is caused by the same periodically(p1) ejected population of electrons in a precessing (p2) jet.

1502.02019	the extreme gamma-ray blazar s5 0716+714: jet conditions from radio-band  variability and radiative transfer modeling	as part of a program to identify the physical conditions in the jets ofgamma-ray-flaring blazars detected by fermi, including the role of shocks inthe production of high-energy flaring, we obtained 4 years of 3-frequency,centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization monitoringobservations of the radio-bright blazar s5 0716+714 with the university ofmichigan 26-m paraboloid. light curves constructed from these data exhibit aseries of rapid, high-amplitude, centimeter-band total flux density outbursts,and changes in the linear polarization consistent with the passage of shocksduring the gamma-ray flaring. the observed spectral evolution of the radio-bandflares, in combination with radiative transfer simulations incorporatingpropagating shocks, was used to constrain the shock and jet flow conditions inthe parsec-scale regions of the jet. eight forward-moving, transverse shockswith unusually-strong shock compression factors, a very fast lorentz factor ofthe shocks of 77, a bulk lorentz factor of the flow of 20, a viewing angle of12 degrees, and an intrinsic opening angle of the radio jet of 5.2 degrees wereidentified.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1504.06115	magic detection of short-term variability of the high-peaked bl lac  object 1es 0806+524	the high-frequency-peaked bl lac (hbl) 1es 0806+524 (z = 0.138) wasdiscovered in vhe $\gamma$ rays in 2008. until now, the broad-band spectrum of1es 0806+524 has been only poorly characterized, in particular at highenergies. we analysed multiwavelength observations from $\gamma$ rays to radioperformed from 2011 january to march, which were triggered by the high activitydetected at optical frequencies. these observations constitute the most precisedetermination of the broad-band emission of 1es 0806+524 to date. thestereoscopic magic observations yielded a $\gamma$-ray signal above 250 gev of$(3.7 \pm 0.7)$ per cent of the crab nebula flux with a statisticalsignificance of 9.9 $\sigma$. the multiwavelength observations showedsignificant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a vhe$\gamma$-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which providedunprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1es 0806+524. the spectrumof this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of $2.97 \pm0.29$ between $\sim$150 gev and 1 tev and an integral flux of $(9.3 \pm 1.9)$per cent of the crab nebula flux above 250 gev. the spectrum during thenon-flaring vhe activity is compatible with the only available vhe observationperformed in 2008 with veritas when the source was in a low optical state. thebroad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zonesynchrotron self compton model with parameters typical for hbls, indicatingthat 1es 0806+524 is not substantially different from the hbls previouslydetected.

0805.1283	long-term radio variability of agn: flare characteristics	we have studied the flare characteristics of 55 agn at 8 different frequencybands between 4.8 and 230 ghz. our extensive database enables us to study thevarious observational properties of flares in these sources and compare ourresults with theoretical models. we visually extracted 159 individual flaresfrom the flux density curves and calculated different parameters, such as thepeak flux density and duration, in all the frequency bands. the selection offlares is based on the 22 and 37 ghz data from mets\"ahovi radio observatoryand 90 and 230 ghz data from the sest telescope. additional lower frequency4.8, 8, and 14.5 ghz data are from the university of michigan radioobservatory. we also calculated variability indices and compared them withearlier studies. the observations seem to adhere well to the shock model, butthere is still large scatter in the data. especially the time delays betweendifferent frequency bands are difficult to study due to the incomplete samplingof the higher frequencies. the average duration of the flares is 2.5 years at22 and 37 ghz, which shows that long-term monitoring is essential forunderstanding the typical behaviour in these sources. it also seems that theenergy release in a flare is independent of the duration of the flare.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

1507.04287	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars from  correlation analysis between 37 ghz radio and gamma-ray light curves	we address the highly debated issue of constraining the gamma-ray emissionregion in blazars from cross-correlation analysis using discrete correlationfunction between radio and gamma-ray light curves. the significance of thecorrelations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating lightcurves and mixed source correlations. the cross-correlation analysis yielded 26sources with significant correlations. in most of the sources, the gamma-raypeaks lead the radio with time lags in the range +20 and +690 days, whereas insources 1633+382 and 3c 345 we find the radio emission to lead the gamma raysby -15 and -40 days, respectively. apart from the individual source study, westacked the correlations of all sources and also those based on sub-samples.the time lag from the stacked correlation is +80 days for the whole sample andthe distance travelled by the emission region corresponds to 7 pc. we alsocompared the start times of activity in radio and gamma rays of the correlatedflares using bayesian block representation. this shows that most of the flaresat both wavebands start at almost the same time, implying a co-spatial originof the activity. the correlated sources show more flares and are brighter inboth bands than the uncorrelated ones.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1511.02654	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars. ii  multifrequency correlations	in an attempt to constrain and understand the emission mechanism of gammarays, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of 15 blazars using light curvesin millimetre, optical and gamma rays. we use discrete correlation function andconsider only correlations significant at 99 per cent level. a strongcorrelation was found between 37 and 95 ghz with a near-zero time delay in mostof the sources, and ~1 month or longer in the rest. a similar result wasobtained between the optical and gamma-ray bands. of the 15 sources, less than50 per cent showed a strong correlation between the millimetre and gamma-ray ormillimetre and optical bands. the primary reason for the lack of statisticallysignificant correlation is the absence of a major outburst in the millimetrebands of most of the sources during the 2.5 yr time period investigated in ourstudy. this may indicate that only the long-term variations or large flares arecorrelated between these bands. the variability of the sources at everywaveband was also inspected using fractional rms variability. the fractionalrms variability displays an increase with frequency reaching its maximum in thegamma rays.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0705.3293	statistical analyses of long-term variability of agn at high radio  frequencies	we present a study of variability time scales in a large sample of activegalactic nuclei at several frequencies between 4.8 and 230 ghz. we investigatethe differences of various agn types and frequencies and correlate the measuredtime scales with physical parameters such as the luminosity and the lorentzfactor. our sample consists of both high and low polarization quasars, bllacertae objects and radio galaxies. the basis of this work is the 22 ghz, 37ghz and 87 ghz monitoring data from the metsahovi radio observatory spanningover 25 years. in addition,we used higher 90 ghz and 230 ghz frequency dataobtained with the sest-telescope between 1987 and 2003. further lower frequencydata at 4.8 ghz, 8 ghz and 14.5 ghz from the university of michigan monitoringprogramme have been used. we have applied three different statistical methodsto study the time scales: the structure function, the discrete correlationfunction and the lomb-scargle periodogram. we discuss also the differences andrelative merits of these three methods. our study reveals that smaller fluxdensity variations occur in these sources on short time scales of 1-2 years,but larger outbursts happen quite rarely, on the average only once in every 6years. we do not find any significant differences in the time scales betweenthe source classes. the time scales are also only weakly related to theluminosity suggesting that the shock formation is caused by jet instabilitiesrather than the central black hole.

0811.4278	doppler factors, lorentz factors and viewing angles for quasars, bl  lacertae objects and radio galaxies	we have calculated variability doppler boosting factors, lorentz factors, andviewing angles for a large sample of sources by using total flux densityobservations at 22 and 37 ghz and vlbi data. we decomposed the flux curves intoexponential flares and determined the variability brightness temperatures ofthe fastest flares. by assuming the same intrinsic brightness temperature foreach source, we calculated the doppler boosting factors for 87 sources. inaddition we used new apparent jet speed data to calculate the lorentz factorsand viewing angles for 67 sources. we find that all quasars in our sample aredoppler-boosted and that the doppler boosting factors of bl lacertae objectsare lower than of quasars. the new lorentz factors are about twice as high asin earlier studies, which is mainly due to higher apparent speeds in ouranalyses. the jets of bl lacertae objects are slower than of quasars. there aresome extreme sources with very high derived lorentz factors of the order of ahundred. these high lorentz factors could be real. it is also possible that thesources exhibit such rapid flares that the fast variations have remainedundetected in monitoring programmes, or else the sources have a complicated jetstructure that is not amenable to our simple analysis. almost all the sourcesare seen in a small viewing angle of less than 20 degrees. our results followthe predictions of basic unification schemes for agn.
