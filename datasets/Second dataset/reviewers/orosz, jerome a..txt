0901.0920	a determination of the spin of the black hole primary in lmc x-1	the first extragalactic x-ray binary, lmc x-1, was discovered in 1969. in the1980s, its compact primary was established as the fourth dynamical black-holecandidate. recently, we published accurate values for the mass of the blackhole and the orbital inclination angle of the binary system. building on theseresults, we have analyzed 53 x-ray spectra obtained by rxte and, using aselected sample of 18 of these spectra, we have determined the dimensionlessspin parameter of the black hole to be a* = 0.92(-0.07,+0.05). this resulttakes into account all sources of observational and model-parameteruncertainties. the standard deviation around the mean value of a* for these 18x-ray spectra, which were obtained over a span of several years, is only 0.02.when we consider our complete sample of 53 rxte spectra, we find a somewhathigher value of the spin parameter and a larger standard deviation. finally, weshow that our results based on rxte data are confirmed by our analyses ofselected x-ray spectra obtained by the xmm-newton, bepposax and ginga missions.

1001.0261	the inclination of the soft x-ray transient a0620--00 and the mass of  its black hole	we analyze photometry of the soft x-ray transient a0620-00 spanning nearly 30years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. previousattempts to determine the inclination of a0620 using subsets of these data haveyielded a wide range of measured values of i. differences in the measured valueof i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertaintyregarding the contamination from the disk. we give a new technique forestimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in alllight curves, even in the infrared. we also find that all changes in the shapeand normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component.after accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, includinglight curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value ofi. combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus0.9 degrees, implying m=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. using ourdynamical model and zero-disk stellar vih magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus orminus 0.12 kpc. understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variabilitymay assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and thefluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool forunderstanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.

1002.2211	the spin of the black hole in the soft x-ray transient a0620--00	during its yearlong outburst in 1975--76, the transient source a0620--00reached an intensity of 50 crab, an all-time record for any x-ray binary. thesource has been quiescent since. we recently determined accurate values for theblack hole mass, orbital inclination angle and distance. building on theseresults, we have measured the radius of the inner edge of the accretion diskaround the black hole primary by fitting its thermal continuum spectrum to ourversion of the relativistic novikov-thorne thin-disk model. we have therebyestimated the spin of the black hole. although our spin estimate depends on asingle high quality spectrum, which was obtained in 1975 by oso-8, we areconfident of our result because of the consistent values of the inner-diskradius that we have obtained for hundreds of observations of other sources:h1743-322, xte j1550-564, and notably lmc x-3. we have determined thedimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a*=0.12+/-0.19, witha*&lt;0.49 and a*&gt;-0.59 at the 3 sigma level of confidence. this result takes intoaccount all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. despitethe low spin, the intensity and properties of the radio counterpart, both inoutburst and quiescence, attest to the presence of a strong jet. if jets aredriven by black hole spin, then current models indicate that jet power shouldbe a steeply increasing function of a*. consequently, the low spin of a0620--00suggests that its jet may be disk-driven.

1007.3637	variable o vi and n v emission from the x-ray binary lmc x-3: heating of  the black hole companion	based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with fuse and cos,we present new detections of o vi and n v emission from the black-hole x-raybinary (xrb) system lmc x-3. we also update the ephemeris of the xrb usingrecent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph onthe magellan-clay telescope. we observe significant velocity variability of theuv emission, and we find that the o vi and n v emission velocities follow theoptical velocity curve of the xrb. moreover, the o vi and n v intensitiesregularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that thesource of the uv emission is increasingly occulted as the b star in the xrbmoves from superior to inferior conjunction. these trends suggest thatillumination of the b-star atmosphere by the intense x-ray emission from theaccreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the b star, and this hotspot is the origin of the o vi and n v emission. however, the velocitysemiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, k_{uv}~180 km/s, is lower than theoptical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the b star.if our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct,then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle,constrain the inclination of the xrb and the mass of the black hole.

1010.1013	the spin of the black hole microquasar xte j1550-564 via the  continuum-fitting and fe-line methods	we measure the spin of xte j1550-564 in two ways: by modelling the thermalcontinuum spectrum of the accretion disc, and independently by modeling thebroad red wing of the reflection fluorescence fe-k line. we find that the spinmeasurements conducted independently using both leading methods are inagreement with one another. for the continuum-fitting analysis, we use a datasample consisting of several dozen rxte spectra, and for the fe-k analysis, weuse a pair of asca spectra from a single epoch. our spin estimate for the blackhole primary using the continuum-fitting method is -0.11 &lt; a* &lt; 0.71 (90 percent confidence), with a most likely spin of a* = 0.34. in obtaining thisresult, we have thoroughly explored the dependence of the spin value on a widerange of model-dependent systematic errors and observational errors; ourprecision is limited by uncertainties in the distance and orbital inclinationof the system. for the fe-line method, our estimate of spin is a* =0.55(+0.15,-0.22). combining these results, we conclude that the spin of thisblack hole is moderate, a* = 0.49(+0.13,-0.20), which suggests that the jet ofthis microquasar is powered largely by its accretion disc rather than by thespin energy of the black hole.

1010.4742	the intriguing evolutionary history of the massive black hole x-ray  binary m33 x-7	black hole (bh) x-ray binaries (xrbs) are x-ray luminous binary systemscomprising a bh accreting matter from a companion star. understanding theirorigins sheds light on the still not well understood physics of bh formation.m33 x-7 hosts one of the most massive stellar-mass bh among all xrbs known todate, a 15.65 msun bh orbiting a 70 msun companion star in a 3.45 day orbit.the high masses of the two components and the tight orbit relative to the largeh-rich stellar component challenge our understanding of the typically invokedbh-xrbs formation channels. the measured underluminosity of the opticalcomponent further complicates the picture. a solution to the evolutionaryhistory of this system that can account for all its observed properties has yetto be presented, and here we propose the first scenario that is consistent withthe complete set of current observational constraints. in our model, m33 x-7started its life hosting a 85-99 msun primary and a 28-32 msun companion in akeplerian orbit of 2.8-3.1 days. in order to form a bh of 15.65 msun, theinitially most massive component transferred part of its envelope to thecompanion star and lost the rest in a strong stellar wind. during thisdynamically stable mass transfer phase the companion accreted matter, to becomethe presently underluminous 70 msun star.

1010.4809	formation of the black-hole binary m33 x-7 via mass-exchange in a tight  massive system	m33 x-7 is among the most massive x-ray binary stellar systems known, hostinga rapidly spinning 15.65 msun black hole orbiting an underluminous 70 msun mainsequence companion in a slightly eccentric 3.45 day orbit. althoughpost-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit, it leavesunexplained the observed x-ray luminosity, star's underluminosity, black hole'sspin, and eccentricity. a common envelope phase, or rotational mixing, couldexplain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to anoverluminous companion. a merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the blackhole were invoked for its spin-up. here we report that, if m33 x-7 started as aprimary of 85-99 msun and a secondary of 28-32 msun, in a 2.8-3.1 day orbit,its observed properties can be consistently explained. in this model, the mainsequence primary transferred part of its envelope to the secondary and lost therest in a wind; it ended its life as a ~16 msun he star with a fe-ni core whichcollapsed to a black hole (with or without an accompanying supernova). therelease of binding energy and, possibly, collapse asymmetries "kicked" thenascent black hole into an eccentric orbit. wind accretion explains the x-rayluminosity, while the black hole spin can be natal.

1101.0811	measuring the spins of accreting black holes	a typical galaxy is thought to contain tens of millions of stellar-mass blackholes, the collapsed remnants of once massive stars, and a single nuclearsupermassive black hole. both classes of black holes accrete gas from theirenvironments. the accreting gas forms a flattened orbiting structure known asan accretion disk. during the past several years, it has become possible toobtain measurements of the spins of the two classes of black holes by modelingthe x-ray emission from their accretion disks. two methods are employed, bothof which depend upon identifying the inner radius of the accretion disk withthe innermost stable circular orbit (isco), whose radius depends only on themass and spin of the black hole. in the fe k method, which applies to bothclasses of black holes, one models the profile of therelativistically-broadened iron line with a special focus on thegravitationally redshifted red wing of the line. in the continuum-fittingmethod, which has so far only been applied to stellar-mass black holes, onemodels the thermal x-ray continuum spectrum of the accretion disk. we discussboth methods, with a strong emphasis on the continuum-fitting method and itsapplication to stellar-mass black holes. spin results for eight stellar-massblack holes are summarized. these data are used to argue that the high spins ofat least some of these black holes are natal, and that the presence or absenceof relativistic jets in accreting black holes is not entirely determined by thespin of the black hole.

1101.2465	refined neutron-star mass determinations for six eclipsing x-ray pulsar  binaries	we present an improved method for determining the mass of neutron stars ineclipsing x-ray pulsar binaries and apply the method to six systems, namelyvela x-1, 4u 1538-52, smc x-1, lmc x-4, cen x-3, and her x-1. in previousstudies to determine neutron star mass, the x-ray eclipse duration has beenapproximated analytically by assuming the companion star is spherical with aneffective roche lobe radius. we use a numerical code based on roche geometrywith various optimizers to analyze the published data for these systems, whichwe supplement with new spectroscopic and photometric data for 4u 1538-52. thisallows us to model the eclipse duration more accurately and thus calculate animproved value for the neutron star mass. the derived neutron star mass alsodepends on the assumed roche lobe filling factor beta of the companion star,where beta = 1 indicates a completely filled roche lobe. in previous work arange of beta between 0.9 and 1.0 was usually adopted. we use opticalellipsoidal lightcurve data to constrain beta. we find neutron star masses of1.77 +/- 0.08 m_{sun} for vela x-1, 0.87 +/- 0.07 m_{sun} for 4u 1538-52(eccentric orbit), 1.00 +/- 0.10 m_{sun} for 4u 1538-52 (circular orbit), 1.04+/- 0.09 m_{sun} for smc x-1, 1.29 +/- 0.05 m_{sun} for lmc x-4, 1.49 +/- 0.08m_{sun} for cen x-3, and 1.07 +/- 0.36 m_{sun} for her x-1. we discuss thelimits of the approximations that were used to derive the earlier massdeterminations, and we comment on the implications our new masses have forobservationally refining the upper and lower bounds of the neutron star massdistribution.

1307.0442	wocs 40007: a detached eclipsing binary near the turnoff of the open  cluster ngc 6819	we analyze extensive bvr_ci_c time-series photometry and radial-velocitymeasurements for wocs 40007 (auner 259; kic 5113053), a double-lined detachedeclipsing binary and a member of the open cluster ngc 6819. utilizingphotometric observations from the 1-meter telescope at mount laguna observatoryand spectra from the wiyn 3.5-meter telescope, we measure precise and accuratemasses (~1.6% uncertainty) and radii (~0.5%) for the binary components. inaddition, we discover a third star orbiting the binary with a period greaterthan 3000 days using radial velocities and kepler eclipse timings.  because the stars in the eclipsing binary are near the cluster turnoff, theyare evolving rapidly in size and are sensitive to age. with a metallicity of[fe/h]=+0.09+/-0.03, we find the age of ngc 6819 to be about 2.4 gyr from cmdisochrone fitting and 3.1+/-0.4 gyr by analyzing the mass-radius (m-r) data forthis binary. the m-r age is above previous determinations for this cluster, butconsistent within 1 sigma uncertainties. when the m-r data for the primary starof the additional cluster binary wocs 23009 is included, the weighted ageestimate drops to 2.5+/-0.2 gyr, with a systematic uncertainty of at least 0.2gyr. the age difference between our cmd and m-r findings may be the result ofsystematic error in the metallicity or helium abundance used in models, or dueto slight radius inflation of one or both stars in the wocs 40007 binary.

1308.4760	confirmation via the continuum-fitting method that the spin of the black  hole in cygnus x-1 is extreme	in gou et al. (2011), we reported that the black hole primary in the x-raybinary cygnus x-1 is a near-extreme kerr black hole with a spin parametera*&gt;0.95(3{\sigma}). we confirm this result while setting a new and morestringent limit: a*&gt;0.983 at the 3{\sigma}(99.7%) level of confidence. theearlier work, which was based on an analysis of all three useful spectra thatwere then available, was possibly biased by the presence in these spectra of arelatively strong compton power-law component: the fraction of the thermal seedphotons scattered into the power law was f_s=23-31%, while the upper limit forreliable application of the continuum-fitting method is f_s&lt;25%. we havesubsequently obtained six additional spectra of cygnus x-1 suitable for themeasurement of spin. five of these spectra are of high quality with f_s in therange 10% to 19%, a regime where the continuum-fitting method has been shown todeliver reliable results. individually, the six spectra give lower limits onthe spin parameter that range from a*&gt;0.95 to a*&gt;0.98, allowing us toconservatively conclude that the spin of the black hole is a*&gt;0.983(3{\sigma}).

1401.4190	the black hole binary v4641 sagitarii: activity in quiescence &amp; improved  mass determinations	we examine ~10 years of photometric data and find that the black hole x-raybinary v4641 sgr has two optical states, passive and active, during x-rayquiescence. the passive state is dominated by ellipsoidal variations and isstable in the shape and variability of the light curve. the active state isbrighter and more variable. emission during the active state varies over thecourse of the orbital period and is redder than the companion star. theseoptical/infrared states last for weeks or months. v4641 sgr spendsapproximately 85% of x-ray quiescence in the passive state and 15% in theactive. we analyze passive colors and spectroscopy of v4641 sgr and show thatthey are consistent with a reddened b9iii star (with e(b-v) = 0.37 +/- 0.19)with little or no contribution from the accretion disk. we use x-rayobservations with an updated ephemeris to place an upper limit on the durationof an x-ray eclipse of &lt;8.3 deg in phase (~1.6 hours). high resolutionspectroscopy yields a greatly improved measurement of the rotational velocityof the companion star of v_rot_sin(i) = 100.9 +/- 0.8 km s^-1. we fitellipsoidal models to the passive state data and find an inclination angle of i= 72.3 +/- 4.1 deg, a mass ratio of q = 2.2 +/- 0.2, and component masses forthe system of m_bh = 6.4 +/- 0.6 m_sun and m_2 = 2.9 +/- 0.4 m_sun. using thesevalues we calculate an updated distance to v4641 sgr of 6.2 +/- 0.7 kpc.

1401.5529	modeling the optical-x-ray accretion lag in lmc x-3: insights into  black-hole accretion physics	the x-ray persistence and characteristically soft spectrum of the black holex-ray binary lmc x-3 make this source a touchstone for penetrating studies ofaccretion physics. we analyze a rich, 10-year collection of optical/infrared(oir) time-series data in conjunction with all available contemporaneous x-raydata collected by the asm and pca detectors aboard the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. a cross-correlation analysis reveals an x-ray lag of ~2 weeks.motivated by this result, we develop a model that reproduces the complex oirlight curves of lmc x-3. the model is comprised of three components ofemission: stellar light; accretion luminosity from the outer disk inferred fromthe time-lagged x-ray emission; and light from the x-ray-heated star and outerdisk. using the model, we filter a strong noise component out of theellipsoidal light curves and derive an improved orbital period for the system.concerning accretion physics, we find that the local viscous timescale in thedisk increases with the local mass accretion rate; this in turn implies thatthe viscosity parameter alpha decreases with increasing luminosity. finally, wefind that x-ray heating is a strong function of x-ray luminosity below ~50% ofthe eddington limit, while above this limit x-ray heating is heavilysuppressed. we ascribe this behavior to the strong dependence of the flaring inthe disk upon x-ray luminosity, concluding that for luminosities above ~50% ofeddington, the star lies fully in the shadow of the disk.

1401.7275	kepler-413b: a slightly misaligned, neptune-size transiting circumbinary  planet	we report the discovery of a transiting, rp = 4.347+/-0.099rearth,circumbinary planet (cbp) orbiting the kepler k+m eclipsing binary (eb) systemkic 12351927 (kepler-413) every ~66 days on an eccentric orbit with ap =0.355+/-0.002au, ep = 0.118+/-0.002. the two stars, with ma =0.820+/-0.015msun, ra = 0.776+/-0.009rsun and mb = 0.542+/-0.008msun, rb =0.484+/-0.024rsun respectively revolve around each other every10.11615+/-0.00001 days on a nearly circular (eeb = 0.037+/-0.002) orbit. theorbital plane of the eb is slightly inclined to the line of sight (ieb =87.33+/-0.06 degrees) while that of the planet is inclined by ~2.5 degrees tothe binary plane at the reference epoch. orbital precession with a period of~11 years causes the inclination of the latter to the sky plane to continuouslychange. as a result, the planet often fails to transit the primary star atinferior conjunction, causing stretches of hundreds of days with no transits(corresponding to multiple planetary orbital periods). we predict that the nexttransit will not occur until 2020. the orbital configuration of the systemplaces the planet slightly closer to its host stars than the inner edge of theextended habitable zone. additionally, the orbital configuration of the systemis such that the cbp may experience cassini-states dynamics under the influenceof the eb, in which the planet's obliquity precesses with a rate comparable toits orbital precession. depending on the angular precession frequency of thecbp, it could potentially undergo obliquity fluctuations of dozens of degrees(and complex seasonal cycles) on precession timescales.

1402.0085	the mass of the black hole in lmc x-3	we analyze a large set of new and archival photometric and spectroscopicobservations of lmc x-3 to arrive at a self-consistent dynamical model for thesystem. using echelle spectra obtained with the mike instrument on the 6.5mmagellan clay telescope and the uves instrument on the second 8.2m very largetelescope we find a velocity semiamplitude for the secondary star of$k_2=241.1\pm 6.2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the uncertainty includes an estimate ofthe systematic error caused by x-ray heating. using the spectra, we also find aprojected rotational velocity of $v_{\rm rot}\sin i=118.5\pm 6.6$ km s$^{-1}$.from an analysis of archival $b$ and $v$ light curves as well as new $b$ and$v$ light curves from the smarts 1.3m telescope, we find an inclination of$i=69.84\pm 0.37^{\circ}$ for models that do not include x-ray heating and aninclination of $i=69.24\pm 0.72^{\circ}$ for models that incorporate x-rayheating. adopting the latter inclination measurement, we find masses of$3.63\pm 0.57\,m_{\odot}$ and $6.98\pm 0.56\,m_{\odot}$ for the companion starand the black hole, respectively. we briefly compare our results with earlierwork and discuss some of their implications.

0803.1834	precise measurement of the spin parameter of the stellar-mass black hole  m33 x-7	in prior work, {\it chandra} and gemini-north observations of the eclipsingx-ray binary m33 x-7 have yielded measurements of the mass of its black holeprimary and the system's orbital inclination angle of unprecedented accuracy.likewise, the distance to the binary is known to a few percent. in an analysisbased on these precise results, fifteen {\it chandra} and {\it xmm-newton}x-ray spectra, and our fully relativistic accretion disk model, we find thatthe dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole primary is $a_* = 0.77 \pm0.05$. the quoted 1-$\sigma$ error includes all sources of observationaluncertainty. four {\it chandra} spectra of the highest quality, which wereobtained over a span of several years, all lead to the same estimate of spin towithin statistical errors (2%), and this estimate is confirmed by 11 spectra oflower quality. there are two remaining uncertainties: (1) the validity of therelativistic model used to analyze the observations, which is being addressedin ongoing theoretical work; and (2) our assumption that the black hole spin isapproximately aligned with the angular momentum vector of the binary, which canbe addressed by a future x-ray polarimetry mission.

1409.1605	kic 9632895 - the 10th kepler transiting circumbinary planet	we present the discovery of kic 9632895b, a 6.2 earth-radius planet in alow-eccentricity, 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary. the binary itselfconsists of a 0.93 and 0.194 solar mass pair of stars with an orbital period of27.3 days. the plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and itsinclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in thelatter portion of the kepler data. thus three transits are present in thelatter half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions thatoccurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits. theprecession period is ~103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visibleonly ~8% of the time. this has the important implication that for every systemlike kic 9632895 that we detect, there are ~12 circumbinary systems that existbut are not currently exhibiting transits. the planet's mass is too small tonoticeably perturb the binary, consequently its mass is not measurable withthese data; but our photodynamical model places a 1-sigma upper limit of 16earth masses. with a period 8.8 times that of the binary, the planet is welloutside the dynamical instability zone. it does, however, lie within thehabitable zone of the binary, and making it the third of ten keplercircumbinary planets to do so.

1501.00982	a dynamical study of the black hole x-ray binary nova muscae 1991	we present a dynamical study of the galactic black hole binary system novamuscae 1991 (gs/grs 1124-683). we utilize 72 high resolution magellanechellette (mage) spectra and 72 strictly simultaneous v-band photometricobservations; the simultaneity is a unique and crucial feature of thisdynamical study. the data were taken on two consecutive nights and cover thefull 10.4-hour orbital cycle. the radial velocities of the secondary star aredetermined by cross-correlating the object spectra with the best-match templatespectrum obtained using the same instrument configuration. based on ourindependent analysis of five orders of the echellette spectrum, thesemi-amplitude of the radial velocity of the secondary is measured to be k_2 =406.8+/-2.7 km/s, which is consistent with previous work, while the uncertaintyis reduced by a factor of 3. the corresponding mass function is f(m) =3.02+/-0.06 m_\odot. we have also obtained an accurate measurement of therotational broadening of the stellar absorption lines (v sin i = 85.0+/-2.6km/s) and hence the mass ratio of the system q = 0.079+/-0.007. finally, wehave measured the spectrum of the non-stellar component of emission that veilsthe spectrum of the secondary. in a future paper, we will use ourveiling-corrected spectrum of the secondary and accurate values of k_2 and q tomodel multi-color light curves and determine the systemic inclination and themass of the black hole.

1504.04028	time variation of kepler transits induced by stellar spots - a way to  distinguish between prograde and retrograde motion. ii. application to kois	mazeh, holczer, and shporer (2015) have presented an approach that can, inprinciple, use the derived transit timing variation (ttv) of some transitingplanets observed by the $kepler$ mission to distinguish between prograde andretrograde motion of their orbits with respect to their parent stars' rotation.the approach utilizes ttvs induced by spot-crossing events that occur when theplanet moves across a spot on the stellar surface, looking for a correlationbetween the derived ttvs and the stellar brightness derivatives at thecorresponding transits. this can work even in data that cannot temporallyresolve the spot-crossing events themselves. here we apply this approach to the$kepler$ kois, identifying nine systems where the photometric spot modulationis large enough and the transit timing accurate enough to allow detection of attv-brightness-derivatives correlation. of those systems five show highlysignificant prograde motion (kepler-17b, kepler-71b, koi-883.01, koi-895.01,and koi-1074.01), while no system displays retrograde motion, consistent withthe suggestion that planets orbiting cool stars have prograde motion. all fivesystems have impact parameter $0.2\lesssim b\lesssim0.5$, and all systemswithin that impact parameter range show significant correlation, excepthat-p-11b where the lack of a correlation follows its large stellar obliquity.our search suffers from an observational bias against detection of high impactparameter cases, and the detected sample is extremely small. nevertheless, ourfindings may suggest that stellar spots, or at least the larger ones, tend tobe located at a low stellar latitude, but not along the stellar equator,similar to the sun.

1601.00038	kic 9246715: the double red giant eclipsing binary with odd oscillations	we combine kepler photometry with ground-based spectra to present acomprehensive dynamical model of the double red giant eclipsing binary kic9246715. while the two stars are very similar in mass (m1 = 2.171 [+0.006 /-0.008], m2 = 2.149 [+0.006 / -0.008] msun) and radius (r1 = 8.37 [+0.03 /-0.07], r2 = 8.30 [+0.04 / -0.03] rsun), an asteroseismic analysis finds onemain set of solar-like oscillations with unusually low-amplitude, wide modes. asecond set of oscillations from the other star may exist, but this marginaldetection is extremely faint. because the two stars are nearly twins, kic9246715 is a difficult target for a precise test of the asteroseismic scalingrelations, which yield m = 2.17 +/- 0.14 msun and r = 8.26 +/- 0.18 rsun. bothstars are consistent with the inferred asteroseismic properties, but we suspectthe main oscillator is star 2 because it is less active than star 1. we findevidence for stellar activity and modest tidal forces acting over the 171-dayeccentric orbit, which are likely responsible for the essential lack ofsolar-like oscillations in one star and weak oscillations in the other. mixedmodes indicate the main oscillating star is on the secondary red clump (acore-he-burning star), and stellar evolution modeling supports this with acoeval history for a pair of red clump stars. this system is a useful casestudy and paves the way for a detailed analysis of more red giants in eclipsingbinaries, an important benchmark for asteroseismology.

(1999, 2000).during the first 60 days of the observed optical re-flare, we find nocorrespondence between the thermal component of the x-rays often associatedwith a disk and the optical flux -- the former remains essentially flat whereasthe latter declines exponentially and exhibits three substantial dips. however,the power law flux is anti-correlated with the optical dips, suggesting thatthe optical flux may by up-scattered into the x-ray by the hot corona. periodicmodulations were discovered during the final stage of the outburst (may tojune), with p=1.546+/-0.038 days, and during quiescence (july and august), withp=1.540+/-0.008 days. the analysis of the combined data set reveals a strongsignal for a unique period at p=1.541+/-0.009 days, which we believe to be theorbital period.

astro-ph;0010114	the use of the nextgen model atmospheres for cool giants in a light  curve synthesis code	we have written a light curve synthesis code that makes direct use of modelatmosphere specific intensities, in particular the nextgen model atmospheregrid for cool giants (t_eff &lt;= 6800 k and log(g) &lt;= 3.5, hauschildt et al.1999). we point out that these models (computed using spherical geometry)predict a limb darkening behaviour that deviates significantly from a simplelinear or two-parameter law (there is less intensity at the limb of the star).the presence of a significantly nonlinear limb darkening law has two mainconsequences. first, the ellipsoidal light curve computed for a tidallydistorted giant using the nextgen intensities is in general different from thelight curve computed using the same geometry but with the black bodyapproximation and a one- or two-parameter limb darkening law. in most cases thelight curves computed with the nextgen intensities have deeper minima thantheir black body counterparts. thus the light curve solutions for binaries witha giant component obtained with models with near linear limb darkening (eitherblack body or plane-parallel model atmosphere intensities) are biased.observations over a wide wavelength range (i.e. both the optical and infrared)are particularly useful in discriminating between models with nearly linearlimb darkening and the nextgen models. second, we show that rotationalbroadening kernels for roche lobe filling (or nearly filling) giants can besignificantly different from analytic kernels due to a combination of thenonspherical shape of the star and the radical departure from a simple limbdarkening law. as a result, geometrical information inferred from v_rot*sin(i)measurements of cool giants in binary systems are likewise biased.

(science, 298, 196 and astro-ph/0210224), and here, we present an analysisof the three chandra observations made between 2000 june and 2000 september.for these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward directionaway from the point source associated with the compact object. the separationbetween the new source and the compact object changes from 21.3 arcseconds injune to 23.4 arcseconds in september, implying a proper motion of 21.2 +/- 7.2mas/day, a projected separation of 0.31-0.85 pc and an apparent jet velocitybetween 0.34 +/- 0.12 and 0.93 +/- 0.32 times the speed of light for a sourcedistance range of d = 2.8-7.6 kpc. these observations represent the first timethat an x-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretionpowered galactic or extra-galactic source. while this work deals with the jetto the east of the compact object, the western jet has also been detected inthe x-ray and radio bands. the most likely scenario is that the eastern jet isthe approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black holein 1998. along with a 1998 vlbi proper motion measurement, the chandra propermotion indicates that the eastern jet decelerated between 1998 and 2000. wepresent results on the morphology and energy spectrum of the jet. we cannotdefinitively determine the x-ray emission mechanism, but a synchrotron originis viable and may provide the simplest explanation for the observations.

astro-ph;0404343	orbital parameters for the black hole binary xte j1650-500	(shortened) we present r-band photometry of the x-ray transient and candidateblack hole binary xte j1650-500 obtained between 2003 may and august with the6.5m clay telescope. a timing analysis of these data reveals a photometricperiod of 0.3205 +/- 0.0007 days (i.e. 7.63 hr) with a possible alias at 0.3785days (9.12 hr). our photometry completely rules out the previously publishedspectroscopic period of 0.212 days (5.09 hr). consequently, we reanalyzed the15 archival eso/vlt spectra (obtained 2002 june by sanchez-fernandez et al.)that were the basis of the previously published spectroscopic period. we used a``restframe search'' technique that is well suited for cases when thesignal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. the results confirmed thephotometric period of 0.3205 days, and rule out the alias period near 0.38days. the best value for the velocity semiamplitude of the companion star isk_2 = 435 +/- 30 km/sec, and the corresponding optical mass function is f(m) =2.73 +/- 0.56 solar masses. the amplitude of the phased r-band light curve is0.2 magnitudes, which gives a lower limit to the inclination of 50 +/- 3degrees in the limiting case of no contribution to the r-band light curve fromthe accretion disk. if the mass ratio of xte j1650-500 is similar to the massratios of other black hole binaries like a0620-00 or grs 1124-683 (e.g. q &gt;~10), then our lower limit to the inclination gives an upper limit to the massof the black hole in xte j1650-500 of m_1 &lt;~ 7.3 solar masses. however, themass can be considerably lower if the r-band flux is dominated by the accretiondisk. for example, if the accretion disk does contribute 80% of the flux, asour preliminary results suggest, then the black hole mass would be only about 4solar masses.

($4.1\sigma$; 3--35 kev); and (2) a second group with lower 7-35 kev count rates (26intervals) produced an average pds with a qpo at $242 \pm 3$ hz ($6.0 \sigma$;7--35 kev). the ratio of these two frequencies is $1.46 \pm 0.05$. this findingis consistent with results obtained for three other black hole systems thatexhibit commensurate hfqpos in a 3:2 ratio. furthermore, the occurrence ofh1743-322's slower hfqpo at times of higher x-ray luminosity closely resemblesthe behavior of xte j1550-564 and gro j1655-40. we discuss our results in termsof a resonance model that invokes frequencies set by general relativity fororbital motions near a black-hole event horizon.

astro-ph;9901177	the optical light curves of cygnus x-2 (v1341 cyg) and the mass of its  neutron star	we present u, b and v light curves (taken from the literature) of the lowmass x-ray binary cygnus x-2. the ``lower envelope'' of the light curves foldedon the orbital period are ellipsoidal. we fit an ellipsoidal model to the lowerenvelopes of the b and v light curves to derive inclination constraints. if weassume the accretion disc is steady-state where its radial temperature profilegoes as t(r) \propto r^{-3/4}, we find an inclination of i = 62.5 +/- 4 deg.however, the predicted ratio of the disc flux to the total flux in b (the``disc fraction'') is larger than what is observed (about 0.55 compared to &lt;0.3). if we use a flatter radial temperature profile of the disc expected forstrongly irradiated discs (t(r) \propto r^{-3/7}), then we find an inclinationof i = 54.6 deg and a disc fraction in b of approximately 0.30. however, inthis case the value of chi^2 is much larger (48.4 with 36 degrees of freedomcompared to 40.9 for the steady-state case). adopting i = 62.5 +/- 4 deg andusing a previous determination of the mass ratio (q = m_c/m_x = 0.34 +/- 0.04)and the optical mass function (f(m) = 0.69 +/- 0.03 solar masses), we find thatthe mass of the neutron star is m_x = 1.78 +/- 0.23 solar masses and the massof the secondary star is m_c = 0.60 +/- 0.13 solar masses. we derive a distanceof d = 7.2 +/- 1.1 kpc, which is significantly smaller than a recent distancemeasurement of d = 11.6 +/- 0.3 kpc derived from an observation of a type iradius-expansion x-ray burst, but consistent with earlier distance estimates.(abridged)

0810.3447	a new dynamical model for the black hole binary lmc x-1	we present a dynamical model of the high mass x-ray binary lmc x-1 based onhigh-resolution optical spectroscopy and extensive optical and near-infraredphotometry. from our new optical data we find an orbital period of p=3.90917+/- 0.00005 days. we present a refined analysis of the all sky monitor datafrom rxte and find an x-ray period of p=3.9094 +/- 0.0008 days, which isconsistent with the optical period. a simple model of thomson scattering in thestellar wind can account for the modulation seen in the x-ray light curves. thev-k color of the star (1.17 +/- 0.05) implies a_v = 2.28 +/- 0.06, which ismuch larger than previously assumed. for the secondary star, we measure aradius of r_2 = 17.0 +/- 0.8 solar radii and a projected rotational velocity ofv_rot*sin(i) = 129.9 +/- 2.2 km/s. using these measured properties to constrainthe dynamical model, we find an inclination of i = 36.38 +/- 1.92 deg, asecondary star mass of m_2 = 31.79 +/- 3.48 solar masses, and a black hole massof 10.91 +/- 1.41 solar masses. the present location of the secondary star in atemperature-luminosity diagram is consistent with that of a star with aninitial mass of 35 solar masses that is 5 myr past the zero-age main sequence.the star nearly fills its roche lobe (~90% or more), and owing to the rapidchange in radius with time in its present evolutionary state, it will encounterits roche lobe and begin rapid and possibly unstable mass transfer on atimescale of a few hundred thousand years.
