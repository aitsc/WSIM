0901.1039	narrow radiative recombination continua: a signature of ions crossing  the contact discontinuity of astrophysical shocks	x-rays from planetary nebulae (pns) are believed to originate from a shockdriven into the fast stellar wind (v ~ 1000 km/s) as it collides with anearlier circumstellar slow wind (v ~ 10 km/s). in theory, the shocked fast wind(hot bubble) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magneticfields along a surface referred to as the contact discontinuity (cd) thatinhibits diffusion and heat conduction. the cd region is extremely difficult toprobe directly owing to its small size and faint emission. this has largelyleft the study of cds, stellar-shocks, and the associated micro-physics in therealm of theory. this paper presents spectroscopic evidence for ions from thehot bubble (kt ~ 100 ev) crossing the cd and penetrating the cold nebular gas(kt ~ 1 ev). specifically, a narrow radiative recombination continuum (rrc)emission feature is identified in the high resolution x-ray spectrum of the pnbd+30 3639 indicating bare c vii ions are recombining with cool electrons atkt_e=1.7+-1.3 ev. an upper limit to the flux of the narrow rrc of h-like c viis obtained as well. the rrcs are interpreted as due to c ions from the hotbubble of bd+30 3639 crossing the cd into the cold nebula, where theyultimately recombine with its cool electrons. the rrc flux ratio of c vii to cvi constrains the temperature jump across the cd to delta kt &gt; 80 ev, providingfor the first time direct evidence for the stark temperature disparity betweenthe two sides of an astrophysical cd, and constraining the role of magneticfields and heat conduction accordingly. two colliding-wind binaries are notedto have similar rrcs suggesting a temperature jump and cd crossing by ions maybe a common feature of stellar wind shocks.

0901.4095	serendipitous xmm-newton detection of x-ray emission from the bipolar  planetary nebula hb 5	we report the serendipitous detection by the xmm-newton x-ray observatory ofan x-ray source at the position of the type i (he- and n-rich) bipolarplanetary nebula hb 5. the hb 5 x-ray source appears marginally resolved. whilethe small number of total counts (~170) and significant off-axis angle of thex-ray source (~7.8') precludes a definitive spatial analysis, the morphology ofthe x-ray emission appears to trace the brightest features seen in opticalimages of hb 5. the x-ray spectrum is indicative of a thermal plasma at atemperature between 2.4 and 3.7 mk and appears to display strong neon emission.the inferred x-ray luminosity is l_x = 1.5 x 10^32 ergs/s. these resultssuggest that the detected x-ray emission is dominated by shock-heated gas inthe bipolar nebula, although we cannot rule out the presence of a point-likecomponent at the position of the central star. the implications for andcorrespondence with current models of shock-heated gas in planetary nebulae isdiscussed.

0909.4986	spitzer irs spectra of luminous 8 micron sources in the large magellanic  cloud: testing color-based classifications	we present archival spitzer irs spectra of 19 luminous 8 micron selectedsources in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the object classes derived fromthese spectra and from an additional 24 spectra in the literature are comparedwith classifications based on 2mass/msx (j, h, k, and 8 micron) colors in orderto test the "jhk8" classification scheme (kastner et al. 2008). the irs spectraconfirm the classifications of 22 of the 31 sources that can be classifiedunder the jhk8 system. the spectroscopic classification of 12 objects that wereunclassifiable in the jhk8 scheme allow us to characterize regions of thecolor-color diagrams that previously lacked spectroscopic verification,enabling refinements to the jhk8 classification system. the results of thesenew classifications are consistent with previous results concerning theidentification of the most infrared-luminous objects in the lmc. in particular,while the irs spectra reveal several new examples of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars with o-rich envelopes, such objects are still far outnumbered bycarbon stars (c-rich agb stars). we show that spitzer irac/mips color-colordiagrams provide improved discrimination between red supergiants andoxygen-rich and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars relative to thosebased on 2mass/msx colors. these diagrams will enable the most luminous irsources in local group galaxies to be classified with high confidence based ontheir spitzer colors. such characterizations of stellar populations willcontinue to be possible during spitzer's warm mission, through the use of irac[3.6]-[4.5] and 2mass colors.

0910.0503	xmm-newton detection of a transient x-ray source in the vicinity of v838  monocerotis	we report the xmm-newton/epic detection in 2008 march of a luminous (l_x ~10^32-33 erg/s), variable x-ray source in the vicinity (within ~6") of theenigmatic star v838 mon, which underwent a spectacular outburst in early 2002.spectral modeling of the xmm-newton x-ray source indicates the presence of twoplasma components with characteristic temperatures of tx ~ 2x10^6k and~1.5x10^7k, attenuated by an absorbing column (n_h ~ 4 x 10^21cm^-2) that isconsistent with the visual extinction measured toward v838 mon (a_v ~ 2). nosuch luminous source was detected in the immediate vicinity of v838 mon inchandra/acis-s observations obtained about one year after outburst or, mostrecently, in 2010 january. the two xmm source spectral components appear to bemarginally spatially resolved, with the spatial centroid of the hard componentlying closer to (within ~2" of) the position of v838 mon than the broad-bandsource or the soft source component; however, if there are two sources at ornear v838 mon, the chandra nondetections would imply that both of them arevariable. an alternative is that there is a single variable source, and thatthe apparent spatial separation may actually be due to photon-countingstatistics or is perhaps instrumental in origin. we consider constraints placedby the x-ray detection and nondetections on a stellar merger model for the 2002v838 mon outburst, in which the spun-up merger product drives a powerfulmagnetic dynamo. alternatively, the transient behavior of the x-ray sourcecould indicate that the x-rays arose as a consequence of an interaction betweenv838 mon's ejecta and its early-type (b3 v) companion.

1004.1762	comparing shocks in planetary nebulae with the solar wind termination  shock	we show that suprathermal particles, termed pick-up ions (puis), might reducethe postshock temperature of the fast wind and jets in some planetary nebulae(pns) and in symbiotic systems. the goal is to explain the finding that thetemperature of the hot bubble formed by the post-shock gas in some pns andsymbiotic nebulae is lower, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, thanthe value expected from simple hydrodynamical calculations. although variousexplanations have been proposed, there is as yet no prefered solution for thislow tempeature problem. puis have been invoked to explain the low temperaturebehind the termination shock of the solar wind. while in the case of the solarwind the neutral atoms that turn into puis penetrate the pre-shock solar windregion from the interstellar medium (ism), in pns the pui source is more likelyslowly moving clumps embedded in the fast wind or jets. these clumps are formedby instabilities or from backflowing cold gas. our estimates indicate that inyoung pns these puis will thermalize before leaving the system. only in olderpns whose sizes exceed ~5000 au and for which the fast-wind mass loss rate isbelow ~10^{-7} mo/yr do we expect the puis to be an efficient carrier of energyout of the postshock region (the hot bubble).

1007.2838	a few days before the end of the 2008 extreme outburst of ex lup :  accretion shocks and a smothered stellar corona unveiled by xmm-newton	in mid-january 2008, ex lup, the prototype of the small class of eruptivevariables called exors, began an extreme outburst that lasted seven months. weobserved ex lup during about 21 h with xmm-newton, simultaneously in x-rays anduv, on august 10-11, 2008 -- a few days before the end of its 2008 outburst --when the optical flux of ex lup remained about 4 times above its pre-outburstlevel. the observed spectrum of the low-level period is dominated below ~1.5kev by emission from a relatively cool plasma (~4.7 mk) that is lightlyabsorbed (nh~3.6e20 cm^-2) and above ~1.5 kev by emission from a plasma that is~ten times hotter and affected by a photoelectric absorption that is 75 timeslarger. during the x-ray flare, the emission measure and the intrinsic x-rayluminosity of this absorbed plasma component is five times higher than duringthe low-level period. the soft x-ray spectral component is most likelyassociated with accretion shocks, as opposed to jet activity, given the absenceof forbidden emission lines of low-excitation species (e.g., [o i]) in opticalspectra of ex lup obtained during outburst. the hard x-ray spectral component,meanwhile, is most likely associated with a smothered stellar corona. the uvemission is reminiscent of accretion events, such as those already observedwith the optical/uv monitor from other accreting pre-main sequence stars, andis evidently dominated by emission from accretion hot spots. the largephotoelectric absorption of the active stellar corona is most likely due tohigh-density gas above the corona in accretion funnel flows (abridged).

1007.3981	chandra x-ray detection of the enigmatic field star bp psc	bp psc is a remarkable emission-line field star that is orbited by a dustydisk and drives a parsec-scale system of jets. we report the detection by thechandra x-ray observatory of a weak x-ray point source coincident with thecentroids of optical/ir and submillimeter continuum emission at bp psc. as thestar's photosphere is obscured throughout the visible and near-infrared, thechandra x-ray source likely represents the first detection of bp psc itself.the x-rays most likely originate with magnetic activity at bp psc and hence canbe attributed either to a stellar corona or to star-disk interactions. the logof the ratio of x-ray to bolometric luminosity (log(l_x/l_{bol}) lies in therange -5.8 to -4.2. this is smaller than log(l_x/l_{bol}) ratios typical oflow-mass, pre-main sequence stars, but is well within the log(l_x/l_{bol})range observed for rapidly-rotating (fk com-type) g giant stars. hence, thechandra results favor an exotic model wherein the disk/jet system of bp psc isthe result of its very recently engulfing a companion star or giant planet, asthe primary star ascended the giant branch.

1007.3993	imaging the molecular disk orbiting the twin young suns of v4046 sgr	we have imaged the disk surrounding the nearby (d~73 pc), ~12 myr, classicalt tauri binary system v4046 sgr with the submillimeter array (sma) at anangular resolution of ~2". we detect a rotating disk in 12co(2-1) and 13co(2-1)emission, and resolve the continuum emission at 1.3 mm. we infer disk gas anddust masses of ~110 and ~40 earth masses, respectively. fits to a power-lawdisk model indicate that the molecular disk extends to ~370 au and is viewed atan inclination of between ~33 and ~39 degrees for dynamical stellar massesranging from 1.8 $m_\odot$ down to 1.5 $m_\odot$ (the range of total masspreviously determined for the central, 2.4 day spectroscopic binary). thisrange of disk inclination is consistent with that assumed in deducing thecentral binary mass (i.e., 35 degrees), suggesting that the v4046 sgr binarysystem and its circumbinary, molecular disk are coplanar. in light of thesystem's age and binarity, the presence of an extensive molecular disk orbitingv4046 sgr provides constraints on the timescales of processes related to jovianplanet formation, and demonstrates that circumbinary jovian planets potentiallycould form around close binary systems.

1008.2910	x-ray emission from the binary central stars of the planetary nebulae  hfg 1, ds 1, and lotr 5	close binary systems undergoing mass transfer or common envelope interactionscan account for the morphological properties of some planetary nebulae. thesearch for close binary companions in planetary nebulae is hindered by thedifficulty of detecting cool, late-type, main sequence companions in binarysystems with hot pre-white dwarf primaries. however, models of binary pnprogenitor systems predict that mass accretion or tidal interactions can inducerapid rotation in the companion, leading to x-ray-emitting coronae. to testsuch models, we have searched for, and detected, x-ray emission from threebinary central stars within planetary nebulae: the post-common envelope closebinaries in hfg 1 and ds 1 consisting of o-type subdwarfs with late-type, mainsequence companions, and the binary system in lotr 5 consisting of o-typesubdwarf and rapidly rotating, late-type giant companion. the x-ray emission ineach case is best characterized by spectral models consisting of twooptically-thin thermal plasma components with characteristic temperatures ofabout 10 mk and 15-40 mk, and total x-ray luminosities about 10^30 erg/s. weconsider the possible origin of the x-ray emission from these binary systemsand conclude that the most likely origin is, in each case, a corona around thelate-type companion, as predicted by models of interacting binaries.

1107.0415	from bipolar to elliptical: simulating the morphological evolution of  planetary nebulae	the majority of proto-planetary nebulae (ppn) are observed to have bipolarmorphologies. the majority of mature pn are observed to have elliptical shapes.in this paper we address the evolution of ppn/pn morphologies attempting tounderstand if a transition from strongly bipolar to elliptical shape can bedriven by changes in the parameters of the mass loss process. to this end wepresent 2.5d hydrodynamical simulations of mass loss at the end stages ofstellar evolution for intermediate mass stars. we track changes in windvelocity, mass loss rate and mass loss geometry. in particular we focus on thetransition from mass loss dominated by a short duration jet flow (driven duringthe ppn phase) to mass loss driven by a spherical fast wind (produced by thecentral star of the pn). we address how such changes in outflow characteristicscan change the nebula from a bipolar to an elliptical morphology. our resultsshow that including a period of jet formation in the temporal sequence of ppnto pn produces realistic nebular synthetic emission geometries. moreimportantly such a sequence provides insight, in principle, into the apparentdifference in morphology statistics characterizing ppn and pn systems. inparticular we find that while jet driven ppn can be expected to be dominated bybipolar morphologies, systems that begin with a jet but are followed by aspherical fast wind will evolve into elliptical nebulae. furthermore, we findthat spherical nebulae are highly unlikely to ever derive from either bipolarppn or elliptical pn.

1108.2534	x-ray production by v1647 ori during optical outbursts	the pre-main sequence star v1647 ori has recently undergone twooptical/near-infrared (oir) outbursts that are associated with dramaticenhancements in the stellar accretion rate. our intensive x-ray monitoring ofthis object affords the opportunity to investigate whether and how the intensex-ray emission is related to pre-ms accretion activity. our analysis of allfourteen chandra x-ray observatory observations of v1647 ori demonstrate thatvariations in the x-ray luminosity of v1647 ori are correlated with similarchanges in the oir brightness of this source during both (2003-2005 and 2008)eruptions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that accretion is the primarygeneration mechanism for the x-ray outbursts. furthermore, the chandramonitoring demonstrates that the x-ray spectral properties of the seconderuption were strikingly similar to those of the 2003 eruption. we find thatx-ray spectra obtained immediately following the second outburst - during whichv1647 ori exhibited high x-ray luminosities, high hardness ratios, and strongx-ray variability - are well modeled as a heavily absorbed (n_h ~ 4x10^22cm^-2), single-component plasma with characteristic temperatures (kt_x ~ 2-6kev) that are consistently too high to be generated via accretion shocks butare in the range expected for plasma heated by magnetic reconnection events. wealso find that the x-ray absorbing column has not changed significantlythroughout the observing campaign. since the oir and x-ray changes arecorrelated, we hypothesize that these reconnection events either occur in theaccretion stream connecting the circumstellar disk to the star or inaccretion-enhanced protostellar coronal activity.

1311.5232	star formation in orion's l1630 cloud: an infrared and multi-epoch x-ray  study	x-ray emission is characteristic of young stellar objects (ysos) and is knownto be highly variable. we investigate, via an infrared and multi-epoch x-raystudy of the l1630 dark cloud, whether and how x-ray variability in youngstellar objects is related to protostellar evolutionary state. we have analyzed11 chandra x-ray observatory observations, obtained over the course of fouryears and totaling ~240 ks exposure time, targeting the eruptive class i ysov1647 ori in l1630. we used 2mass and spitzer data to identify and classify ircounterparts to l1630 x-ray sources and identified a total of 52 x-ray emittingysos with ir counterparts, including 4 class i sources and 1 class 0/i source.we have detected cool (&lt; 3 mk) plasma, possibly indicative of accretion shocks,in three classical t tauri stars. a subsample of 27 x-ray-emitting ysos werecovered by 9 of the 11 chandra observations targeting v1647 ori and vicinity.for these 27 ysos, we have constructed x-ray light curves spanningapproximately four years. these light curves highlight the variable nature ofpre-main sequence x-ray emitting young stars; many of the l1630 ysos vary byorders of magnitude in count rate between observations. we discuss possiblescenarios to explain apparent trends between various x-ray spectral properties,x-ray variance and yso classification.

1401.3368	episodic accretion in young stars	in the last twenty years, the topic of episodic accretion has gainedsignificant interest in the star formation community. it is now viewed as acommon, though still poorly understood, phenomenon in low-mass star formation.the fu orionis objects (fuors) are long-studied examples of this phenomenon.fuors are believed to undergo accretion outbursts during which the accretionrate rapidly increases from typically $10^{-7}$ to a few $10^{-4}$ $m_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, and remains elevated over several decades or more. exors, a looselydefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitiveoutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. the relationship between thetwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequenceevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinctclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occurin the same evolutionary phases? over the past couple of decades, manytheoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin offuor and exor outbursts. in parallel, such accretion bursts have been detectedat an increasing rate, and as observing techniques improve each individualoutburst is studied in increasing detail. we summarize key observations ofpre-main sequence star outbursts, and review the latest thinking on outbursttriggering mechanisms, the propagation of outbursts from star/disk to disk/jetsystems, the relation between classical exors and fuors, and newly discoveredoutbursting sources -- all of which shed new light on episodic accretion. wefinally highlight some of the most promising directions for this field in thenear- and long-term.

astro-ph;0002079	pinpointing the position of the post-agb star at the core of rafgl 2688  using polarimetric imaging with nicmos	we have used infrared polarimetric imaging with nicmos to determine preciselythe position of the star that illuminates (and presumably generated) thebipolar, pre-planetary reflection nebula rafgl 2688 (the egg nebula). thepolarimetric data pinpoint the illuminating star, which is not detecteddirectly at wavelengths less than or equal to 2 microns, at a position wellwithin the dark lane that bisects the nebula, 0.55" (about 550 au) southwest ofthe infrared peak which was previously detected at the southern tip of thenorthern polar lobe. the inferred position of the central star corresponds tothe geometric center of the tips of the four principle lobes of near-infraredh2 emission; identifying the central star at this position also reveals thestrong point symmetric structure of the nebula, as seen both in the intensityand polarization structure of the polar lobes. the polarimetric and imagingdata indicate that the infrared peak directly detected in the nicmos images isa self-luminous source and, therefore, is most likely a distant binarycompanion to the illuminating star. although present theory predicts thatbipolar structure in pre-planetary and planetary nebulae is a consequence ofbinary star evolution, the separation between the components of the rafgl 2688binary system, as deduced from these observations, is much too large for thepresence of the infrared companion to have influenced the structure of therafgl 2688 nebula.

astro-ph;0111266	x-ray emission from central binary systems of planetary nebulae	we study the conditions under which a main sequence binary companion to thecentral ionizing star of a planetary nebula (pn) might become magneticallyactive and thereby display strong x-ray luminosity. since most pne are olderthan few billion years, any main sequence companion will rotate too slowly tohave magnetic activity and hence bright x-ray emission, unless it is spun-up.we demonstrate that if the orbital separation during the agb phase of the pnprogenitor is less than 30-60 au, main sequence companions in the spectral typerange f7 to m4 will accrete enough angular momentum from the agb wind to rotaterapidly, become magnetically active, and exhibit strong x-ray luminosities.lower mass m stars and brown dwarfs can also become magnetically active, butthey should have small orbital separations and hence are less likely to survivethe agb phase of the progenitor. we estimate that 20-30 per cent of ellipticalpne and 30-50 per cent of bipolar pn are likely to have magnetically activecompanions which will reveal themselves in x-ray observations. re-analysis ofchandra x-ray observatory spectroscopy of the compact central source of ngc7293 indicates that the emitting region of this object possesses abundanceanomalies similar to those of coronally active main-sequence stars.

astro-ph;0202139	on the asymmetries of extended x-ray emission from planetary nebulae	chandra x-ray observatory (cxo) images have revealed that the x-ray emittingregions of the molecule-rich young planetary nebulae (pns) bd+30 3639 (bd+30)and ngc 7027 are much more asymmetric than their optical nebulosities. toevaluate the potential origins of these x-ray asymmetries, we analyze x-rayimages of bd+30, ngc 7027, and another planetary nebula resolved by cxo, ngc6543, within specific energy bands. image resolution has been optimized bysub-pixel repositioning of individual x-ray events. the resultingsubarcsecond-resolution images reveal that the soft (e &lt; 0.7 kev) x-rayemission from bd+30 is more uniform than the harder emission, which is largelyconfined to the eastern rim of the optical nebula. in contrast, soft x-raysfrom ngc 7027 are highly localized and this pn is more axially symmetric inharder emission. the broad-band x-ray morphologies of bd+30 and ngc 7027 arehighly anticorrelated with their distributions of visual extinction, asdetermined from high-resolution, space- and ground-based optical and infraredimaging. hence, it is likely that the observed x-ray asymmetries of thesenebulae are due in large part to the effects of nonuniform intranebularextinction. however, the energy-dependent x-ray structures in both nebulae andin ngc 6543 -- which is by far the least dusty and molecule-rich of the threepns, and displays very uniform intranebular extinction -- suggests that othermechanisms, such as the action of collimated outflows and heat conduction, arealso important in determining the detailed x-ray morphologies of youngplanetary nebulae.

astro-ph;0207626	detection of molecular hydrogen orbiting a "naked" t tauri star	astronomers have established that for a few million years newborn starspossess disks of orbiting gas and dust. such disks, which are likely sites ofplanet formation, appear to disappear once these stars reach ages of 5-10 times10^6 yr; yet, &gt;= 10^7 yr is thought necessary for giant planet formation. ifdisks dissipate in less time than is needed for giant planet formation, suchplanets may be rare and those known around nearby stars would be anomalies.herein, we report the discovery of h_2 gas orbiting a weak-lined t tauri starheretofore presumed nearly devoid of circumstellar material. we estimate that asignificant amount of h_2 persists in the gas phase, but only a tiny fractionof this mass emits in the near-infrared. we propose that this star possesses anevolved disk that has escaped detection thus far because much of the dust hascoagulated into planetesimals. this discovery suggests that the theory thatdisks are largely absent around such stars should be reconsidered. thewidespread presence of such disks would indicate that planetesimals can formquickly and giant planet formation can proceed to completion before the gas incircumstellar disks disperses.

astro-ph;0209139	on the luminosities and temperatures of extended x-ray emission from  planetary nebulae	we examine mechanisms that may explain the luminosities and relatively lowtemperatures of extended x-ray emission in planetary nebulae. by building asimple flow structure for the wind from the central star during the proto, andearly, planetary nebulae phase, we estimate the temperature of the x-rayemitting gas and its total x-ray luminosity. we conclude that in order toaccount for the x-ray temperature and luminosity, both the evolution of thewind from the central star and the adiabatic cooling of the post-shocked wind'smaterial must be considered. the x-ray emitting gas results mainly from shockedwind segments that were expelled during the early planetary nebulae phase, whenthe wind speed was moderate. alternatively, the x-ray emitting gas may resultfrom a collimated fast wind blown by a companion to the central star. heatconduction and mixing between hot and cool regions are likely to occur in somecases and may determine the detailed x-ray morphology of a nebula, but are notrequired to explain the basic properties of the x-ray emitting gas.

astro-ph;0209236	magnetic flares on asymptotic giant branch stars	we investigate the consequences of magnetic flares on the surface ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) and similar stars. in contrast to the solar wind,in the winds of agb stars the gas cooling time is much shorter than the outflowtime. as a result, we predict that energetic flaring will not inhibit, and mayeven enhance, dust formation around agb stars. if magnetic flares do occuraround such stars, we expect some agb stars to exhibit x-ray emission; indeedcertain systems including agb stars, such as mira, have been detected inx-rays. however, in these cases, it is difficult to distinguish betweenpotential agb star x-ray emission and, e.g., x-ray emission from the vicinityof a binary companion. analysis of an archival rosat x-ray spectrum of the mirasystem suggests an intrinsic x-ray luminosity 2x10^{29} erg/sec and temperature10^7 k. these modeling results suggest that magnetic activity, either on theagb star (mira a) or on its nearby companion (mira b), is the source of thex-rays, but do not rule out the possibility that the x-rays are generated by anaccretion disk around mira b.

astro-ph;0211509	refining chandra/acis subpixel event repositioning using a backside  illuminated ccd model	subpixel event repositioning (ser) techniques have been demonstrated tosignificantly improve the already unprecedented spatial resolution of chandrax-ray imaging with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis). chandra ccdser techniques are based on the premise that the impact position of events canbe refined, based on the distribution of charge among affected ccd pixels. acisser models proposed thus far are restricted to corner split (3- and 4-pixel)events, and assume that such events take place at the split pixel corners. toimprove the event counting statistics, we modified the acis ser algorithms toinclude 2-pixel split events and single pixel events, using refined estimatesfor photon impact locations. furthermore, simulations that make use of ahigh-fidelity backside illuminated (bi) ccd model demonstrate that mean photonimpact positions for split events are energy dependent leading to furthermodification of subpixel event locations according to event type and energy,for bi acis devices. testing on chandra ccd x-ray observations of the orionnebula cluster indicates that these modified ser algorithms further improve thespatial resolution of chandra/acis, to the extent that the spreading in thespatial distribution of photons is dominated by the high resolution mirrorassembly, rather than by acis pixelization.

astro-ph;0312130	x-ray emission from the pre-planetary nebula henize 3-1475	we report the first detection of x-ray emission in a pre-planetary nebula,hen 3-1475. pre-planetary nebulae are rare objects in the short transitionstage between the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula evolutionaryphases, and hen 3-1475, characterised by a remarkable s-shaped chain of opticalknots, is one of the most noteworthy members of this class. observations withthe advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis) onboard the chandra x-rayobservatory show the presence of compact emission coincident with the brightestoptical knot in this bipolar object, which is displaced from the central starby 2.7 arcsec along the polar axis. model fits to the x-ray spectrum indicatean x-ray temperature and luminosity, respectively, of (4.3-5.7) 10^6 k and(4+/-1.4) 10^{31} (d/5 kpc)^2 erg s^{-1}, respectively. our 3-sigma upper limiton the luminosity of compact x-ray emission from the central star in hen 3-1475is ~5 10^{31} (d/5 kpc)^2 erg s^{-1}. the detection of x-rays in hen 3-1475 isconsistent with models in which fast collimated post-agb outflows are crucialto the shaping of planetary nebulae; we discuss such models in the context ofour observations.

astro-ph;0403062	the coronal x-ray spectrum of the multiple weak-lined t tauri star  system hd 98800	we present high-resolution x-ray spectra of the multiple (hierarchicalquadruple) weak-lined t tauri star system hd 98800, obtained with the highenergy transmission gratings spectrograph (hetgs) aboard the chandra x-rayobservatory (cxo). in the zeroth-order cxo/hetgs x-ray image, both principlebinary components of hd 98800 (a and b, separation 0.8'') are detected;component a was observed to flare during the observation. the infrared excess(dust disk) component, hd 98800b, is a factor ~4 fainter in x-rays than theapparently ``diskless'' hd 98800a, in quiescence. the line ratios of he-likespecies (e.g., ne ix, o vii) in the hd 98800a spectrum indicate that thex-ray-emitting plasma around hd 98800 is in a typical coronal density regime(log n &lt;~ 11). we conclude that the dominant x-ray-emitting component(s) of hd98800 is (are) coronally active. the sharp spectral differences between hd98800 and the classical t tauri star tw hya demonstrate the potential utilityof high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy in providing diagnostics of pre-mainsequence accretion processes.

astro-ph;0408329	x-rays from the mira ab binary system	we present the results of xmm-newton x-ray observations of the mira ab binarysystem, which consists of a pulsating, asymptotic giant branch primary andnearby (~0.6'' separation) secondary of uncertain nature. the epic ccd (mos andpn) x-ray spectra of mira ab are relatively soft, peaking at ~1 kev, with onlyvery weak emission at energies &gt; 3 kev; lines of ne ix, ne x, and o viii areapparent. spectral modeling indicates a characteristic temperature t_x ~ 10^7 kand intrinsic luminosity l_x ~ 5x10^29 erg s^{-1}, and suggests enhancedabundances of o and, possibly, ne and si in the x-ray-emitting plasma. overall,the x-ray spectrum and luminosity of the mira ab system more closely resemblethose of late-type, pre-main sequence stars or late-type, magnetically activemain sequence stars than those of accreting white dwarfs. we conclude that mirab is most likely a late-type, magnetically active, main-sequence dwarf, andthat x-rays from the mira ab system arise either from magnetospheric accretionof wind material from mira a onto mira b, or from coronal activity associatedwith mira b itself, as a consequence of accretion-driven spin-up. one (or both)of these mechanisms also could be responsible for the recently discovered,point-like x-ray sources within planetary nebulae.

astro-ph;0506650	x-ray emission from orion nebula cluster stars with circumstellar disks  and jets	we investigate the x-ray and near-infrared emission properties of a sample ofpre-main sequence (pms) stellar systems in the orion nebula cluster (onc) thatdisplay evidence for circumstellar disks (``proplyds'') and optical jets inhubble space telescope (hst) imaging. approximately 70% of ~140 proplyds weredetected as x-ray sources in the chandra orion ultradeep program observation ofthe onc, including ~25% of proplyds that do not display central stars in hstimaging. many proplyds display near-infrared excesses, suggesting diskaccretion is ongoing onto the central, pms stars. among circumstellar disksthat are detected in absorption in hst imaging, we find that x-ray absorbingcolumn and apparent disk inclination are well correlated, providing insightinto the disk scale heights and metal abundances of uv- and x-ray-irradiatedprotoplanetary disks. jet sources display some of the largest near-infraredexcesses among the x-ray-detected proplyds, suggesting that the origin of thejets is closely related to ongoing, pms stellar accretion. some jet sourcesdisplay double-peaked x-ray spectral energy distributions, with soft componentsindicative of strong shocks in the jet collimation region. these resultssupport models in which circumstellar disks collimate and/or launch jets fromyoung stellar objects and, furthermore, demonstrate that star-disk-jetinteractions may contribute to pms x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0508346	x-ray imaging of planetary nebulae with wolf-rayet-type central stars:  detection of the hot bubble in ngc 40	we present the results of chandra x-ray observatory (cxo) observations of theplanetary nebulae (pns) ngc 40 and hen 2-99. both pns feature late-typewolf-rayet central stars that are presently driving fast ~1000 km/s, massivewinds into denser, slow-moving (~10 km/s) material ejected during recentlyterminated asymptotic giant branch (agb) evolutionary phases. hence, theseobservations provide key tests of models of wind-wind interactions in pns. inngc 40, we detect faint, diffuse x-ray emission distributed within a partialannulus that lies nested within a ~40'' diameter ring of nebulosity observed inoptical and near-infrared images. hen 2-99 is undetected. the inferred x-raytemperature (t_x ~10^6 k) and luminosity (l_x ~ 2 x 10^30 ergs/s) of ngc 40 arethe lowest measured thus far for any pn displaying diffuse x-ray emission.these results, combined with the ring-like morphology of the x-ray emissionfrom ngc 40, suggest that its x-ray emission arises from a ``hot bubble'' thatis highly evolved and is generated by a shocked, quasi-spherical fast wind fromthe central star, as opposed to agb or post-agb jet activity. in constrast, thelack of detectable x-ray emission from hen 2-99 suggests that this pn has yetto enter a phase of strong wind-wind shocks.

astro-ph;0601508	x-rays from hh210 in the orion nebula	we report the detection during the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) oftwo soft, constant, and faint x-ray sources associated with the herbig-haroobject hh210. hh210 is located at the tip of the nne finger of the emissionline system bursting out of the bn-kl complex, northwest of the trapeziumcluster in the omc-1 molecular cloud. using a recent halpha image obtained withthe acs imager on board hst, and taking into account the known proper motionsof hh210 emission knots, we show that the position of the brightest x-raysource, coup703, coincides with the emission knot 154-040a of hh210, which isthe emission knot of hh210 having the highest tangential velocity (425 km/s).the second x-ray source, coup704, is located on the complicated emission tailof hh210 close to an emission line filament and has no obvious optical/infraredcounterpart. spectral fitting indicates for both sources a plasma temperatureof ~0.8 mk and absorption-corrected x-ray luminosities of about 1e30 erg/s(0.5-2.0 kev). these x-ray sources are well explained by a model invoking afast-moving, radiative bow shock in a neutral medium with a density of ~12000cm^{-3}. the x-ray detection of coup704 therefore reveals, in the complicatedhh210 region, an energetic shock not yet identified at other wavelengths.

astro-ph;0603443	spitzer irs spectra of luminous 8 micron sources in the large magellanic  cloud	we have produced an atlas of spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) spectra ofmass-losing, evolved stars in the large magellanic cloud. these stars wereselected to have high mass-loss rates and so contribute significantly to thereturn of processed materials to the ism. our high-quality spectra enable thedetermination of the chemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid-irspectral features and continuum. we have classified the spectral types of thestars and show that the spectral types separate clearly in infrared color-colordiagrams constructed from 2mass data and synthetic irac/mips fluxes derivedfrom our irs spectra. we present diagnostics to identify and classify evolvedstars in nearby galaxies with high confidence levels using spitzer and 2massphotometry. comparison of the spectral classes determined using irs data withthe ir types assigned based on nir colors also revealed a significant number ofmisclassifications and enabled us to refine the nir color criteria resulting inmore accurate nir color classifications of dust-enshrouded objects.

astro-ph;0606756	a spitzer irs spectral atlas of luminous 8 micron sources in the large  magellanic cloud	we present an atlas of spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph (irs)spectra of highly luminous, compact mid-infrared sources in the largemagellanic cloud. sources were selected on the basis of infrared colors and 8micron (msx) fluxes indicative of highly evolved, intermediate- to high-massstars with current or recent mass loss at large rates. we determine thechemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid-ir continuum and spectralfeatures and classify the spectral types of the stars. in the sample of 60sources, we find 21 red supergiants (rsgs), 16 c-rich asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars, 11 hii regions, 4 likely o-rich agb stars, 4 galactic o-rich agbstars, 2 oh/ir stars, and 2 b[e] supergiants with peculiar ir spectra. we findthat the overwhelming majority of the sample agb stars (with typical irluminosities ~1.0e4 l_sun) have c-rich envelopes, while the o-rich objects arepredominantly luminous rsgs with l_ir ~ 1.0e5 l_sun. we determine meanbolometric corrections to the stellar k-band flux densities and find that forcarbon stars, the bolometric corrections depend on the infrared color, whereasfor rsgs, the bolometric correction is independent of ir color. our resultsreveal that objects previously classified as pne on the basis of ir colors arein fact compact hii regions with very red irs spectra that include strongatomic recombination lines and pah emission features. we demonstrate that theirs spectral classes in our sample separate clearly in infrared color-colordiagrams that use combinations of 2mass data and synthetic irac/mips fluxesderived from the irs spectra. on this basis, we suggest diagnostics to identifyand classify, with high confidence levels, ir-luminous evolved stars and hiiregions in nearby galaxies using spitzer and near-infrared photometry.

astro-ph;0703584	the lmc's top 250: classification of the most luminous compact 8 micron  sources in the large magellanic cloud	to ascertain the nature of the brightest compact mid-infrared sources in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), we have applied an updated version of thebuchanan et al. (2006) 2mass-msx color classification system, which is based onthe results of spitzer space telescope spectroscopy, to a mid-infrared (8micron) flux-limited sample of 250 lmc objects for which 2mass and msxphotometry is available. the resulting 2mass-msx ("jhk8") color-basedclassifications of these sources, which constitute the most mid-ir-luminousobjects in the lmc, were augmented, cross-checked, and corrected wherenecessary via a variety of independent means, such that only 47 sources retaintentative classifications and only 10 sources cannot be classified at all. thesample is found to consist primarily of carbon-rich agb stars (~35%), redsupergiants (~18%), and compact h ii regions (~30%), with additional, smallpopulations of oxygen-rich agb stars (~4%), dusty, early-type emission-linestars (~3%), and foreground, o-rich agb stars in the milky way (~3%). the verylarge ratio of c-rich to o-rich objects among the luminous and heavilydust-enshrouded agb stars in our lmc ir source sample is consistent with thehypothesis that carbon stars form easily in lower metallicity environments. wedemonstrate that very luminous c-rich and o-rich agb stars and red supergiants,identified here primarily on the basis of their jhk8 colors, also appear asdistinct clusters in spitzer irac/mips color-color diagrams. thus, inprinciple, the irs-based ir photometric classification techniques applied hereto the lmc can be applied to any external galaxy whose most luminous ir pointsources are detectable and resolvable by 2mass and spitzer.
