0905.0082	eulerian and lagrangian statistics from high resolution numerical  simulations of weakly compressible turbulence	we report a detailed study of eulerian and lagrangian statistics from highresolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic weakly compressibleturbulence. reynolds number at the taylor microscale is estimated to be around600. eulerian and lagrangian statistics is evaluated over a huge data set, madeby $1856^3$ spatial collocation points and by 16 million particles, followedfor about one large-scale eddy turn over time. we present data for eulerian andlagrangian structure functions up to ten order. we analyse the local scalingproperties in the inertial range and in the viscous range. eulerian resultsshow a good superposition with previous data. lagrangian statistics isdifferent from existing experimental and numerical results, for moments ofsixth order and higher. we interpret this in terms of a possible contaminationfrom viscous scale affecting the estimate of the scaling properties in previousstudies. we show that a simple bridge relation based on multifractal theory isable to connect scaling properties of both eulerian and lagrangian observables,provided that the small differences between intermittency of transverse andlongitudinal eulerian structure functions are properly considered.

1202.3997	the detonation mechanism of the pulsationally-assisted  gravitationally-confined detonation model of type ia supernovae	we describe the detonation mechanism comprising the "pulsationally assisted"gravitationally confined detonation (gcd) model of type ia supernovae sne ia.this model is analogous to the previous gcd model reported in jordan etal.(2008); however, the chosen initial conditions produce a substantivelydifferent detonation mechanism, resulting from a larger energy release duringthe deflagration phase. the resulting final kinetic energy and nickel-56 yieldsconform better to observational values than is the case for the "classical" gcdmodels. in the present class of models, the ignition of a deflagration phaseleads to a rising, burning plume of ash. the ash breaks out of the surface ofthe white dwarf, flows laterally around the star, and converges on thecollision region at the antipodal point from where it broke out. the amount ofenergy released during the deflagration phase is enough to cause the star torapidly expand, so that when the ash reaches the antipodal point, the surfacedensity is too low to initiate a detonation. instead, as the ash flows into thecollision region (while mixing with surface fuel), the star reaches itsmaximally expanded state and then contracts. the stellar contraction acts toincrease the density of the star, including the density in the collisionregion. this both raises the temperature and density of the fuel-ash mixture inthe collision region and ultimately leads to thermodynamic conditions that arenecessary for the zel'dovich gradient mechanism to produce a detonation. wedemonstrate feasibility of this scenario with three 3-dimensional (3d), fullstar simulations of this model using the flash code. we characterized thesimulations by the energy released during the deflagration phase, which rangedfrom 38% to 78% of the white dwarf's binding energy. we show that the necessaryconditions for detonation are achieved in all three of the models.

1306.1481	the effect of the pre-detonation stellar internal velocity profile on  the nucleosynthetic yields in type ia supernova	a common model of the explosion mechanism of type ia supernovae is based on adelayed detonation of a white dwarf. a variety of models differ primarily inthe method by which the deflagration leads to a detonation. a common feature ofthe models, however, is that all of them involve the propagation of thedetonation through a white dwarf that is either expanding or contracting, wherethe stellar internal velocity profile depends on both time and space. in thiswork, we investigate the effects of the pre-detonation stellar internalvelocity profile and the post-detonation velocity of expansion on theproduction of alpha-particle nuclei, including ni56, which are the primarynuclei produced by the detonation wave. we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations of the explosion phase of the white dwarf for center and off-centerdetonations with five different stellar velocity profiles at the onset of thedetonation. we observe two distinct post-detonation expansion phases:rarefaction and bulk expansion. almost all the burning to ni56 occurs only inthe rarefaction phase, and its expansion time scale is influenced bypre-existing flow structure in the star, in particular by the pre-detonationstellar velocity profile. we find that the mass fractions of the alpha-particlenuclei, including ni56, are tight functions of the empirical physical parameterrho_up/v_down, where rho_up is the mass density immediately upstream of thedetonation wave front and v_down is the velocity of the flow immediatelydownstream of the detonation wave front. we also find that v_down depends onthe pre-detonation flow velocity. we conclude that the properties of thepre-existing flow, in particular the internal stellar velocity profile,influence the final isotopic composition of burned matter produced by thedetonation.

0801.4319	global properties of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts  observed by swift	we describe and discuss the spectral and temporal characteristics of theprompt emission and x-ray afterglow emission of x-ray flashes (xrfs) andx-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (xrrs) detected and observed by swift betweendecember 2004 and september 2006. we compare these characteristics to a sampleof conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (c-grbs) observed during the sameperiod. we confirm the correlation between epeak_obs and fluence noted byothers and find further evidence that xrfs, xrrs and c-grbs form a continuum.we also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with thecorrelation between the peak energy in the grb rest frame (epeak_src) and theisotropic radiated energy (eiso), so called the epeak_src-eiso relation. thespectral properties of x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs are similar, but thetemporal properties of xrfs and c-grbs are quite different. we found that thelight curves of c-grb afterglows show a break to steeper indices(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do xrf afterglows.moreover, the overall luminosity of xrf x-ray afterglows is systematicallysmaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of c-grbs. these distinctdifferences between the x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs may be the key tounderstanding not only the mysterious shallow-to-steep break in x-ray afterglowlight curves, but also the unique nature of xrfs.

0808.0930	a line-of-sight galaxy cluster collision: simulated x-ray observations	several lines of evidence have suggested that the the galaxy clustercl~0024+17, an apparently relaxed system, is actually a collision of twoclusters, the interaction occurring along our line of sight. in this paper wepresent a high-resolution $n$-body/hydrodynamics simulation of such acollision. we have created mock x-ray observations of our simulated systemusing marx, a program that simulates the on-orbit performance of the chandrax-ray observatory. we analyze these simulated data to generate radial profilesof the surface brightness and temperature. at later times, $t = 2.0-3.0$ gyrafter the collision, the simulated surface brightness profiles are better fitby a superposition of two $\beta$-model profiles than a single profile, inagreement with the observations of cl~0024+17. in general, due to projectioneffects, much of the post-collision density and temperature structure of theclusters is not seen in the observations. in particular, the observedtemperatures from spectral fitting are much lower than the temperature of thehottest gas. we determine from our fitted profiles that if the system ismodeled as a single cluster, the hydrostatic mass estimate is a factor$\sim$2-3 less than the actual mass, but if the system is modeled as two galaxyclusters in superposition, a hydrostatic mass estimation can be made which isaccurate to within $\sim$10%. we examine some implications of these results forgalaxy cluster x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0110344	early-type galaxies in the sdss	a sample of nearly 9000 early-type galaxies, in the redshift range0.01&lt;z&lt;0.3, was selected from the sloan digital sky survey using morphologicaland spectral criteria. the sample was used to study how early-type galaxyobservables, including luminosity l, effective radius r, surface brightness i,color, and velocity dispersion v, are correlated with one another. measurementbiases are understood with mock catalogs which reproduce all of the observedscaling relations. at any given redshift, the intrinsic distribution ofluminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions in our sample are allapproximately gaussian. in the r* band l ~ v^3.91, l ~ r^1.58, r ~ i^(-0.75),and the fundamental plane relation is r ~ v^(1.49) i^(-0.75). these relationsare approximately the same in the g*, i* and z* bands. at fixed luminosity, themass-to-light ratio scales as m/l ~ l^0.14. the g*-r* color scales as v^0.25.color also correlates with magnitude and size, but these correlations areentirely due to the l-v and r-v relations. chemical evolution and starformation histories are investigated using co-added spectra of similar objectsin our sample. chemical abundances correlate primarily with velocitydispersion. at fixed v, the higher redshift population is bluer, is weaker inmg2, and is stronger in hbeta than the population nearby. in addition, thepopulation at higher redshifts is slightly more luminous. these differences areconsistent with that of a passively evolving population which formed the bulkof its stars about 9 gyrs ago. the fundamental plane suggests that galaxies indense regions are slightly different from those in less dense regions, but theco-added spectra and color--magnitude relations show no statisticallysignificant dependence on environment.

astro-ph;0111054	sdss j124602.54+011318.8: a highly luminous optical transient at z=0.385	we report the discovery of a highly luminous optical transient (ot), sdssj124602.54+011318.8, associated with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. in thispaper we consider the possibility that the ot may be a grb afterglow. threesets of images and two sets of spectra were obtained as part of the normaloperations of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). in the first two image sets,observed two nights apart, the object appears as a point source at$r^{*}\approx 17$. the third image set, observed about 410 days later, shows anextended source which is more than 2.5 magnitudes fainter. the spectra wereobserved about 400 and 670 days after the first two image sets, and both showan apparently normal galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. associating the ot with thegalaxy, the absolute magnitude was $m_{r^*}=-24.8$, which is over 4 magnitudesbrighter than the most luminous supernova ever measured. the spectral energydistributions of the galaxy-subtracted ot derived from the first two image setsare well-fit by single power-laws with indices of $\beta_{\nu}=-0.92$ and -1.29respectively, similar to most grb afterglows. based upon the luminosity of theot, non-detections in contemporaneous rotse-i images, and the change inspectral slope, the ot, if an afterglow, was likely discovered early during a``plateau'' or slowly-fading phase. the discovery of a grb afterglow at thisstage of the sdss is consistent with expectations, but only if the opticalemission is much less strongly beamed than the gamma-rays. we emphasize thatother explanations for the ot cannot be ruled out; a recent follow-up study by[galyam02] provides strong evidence that this source is in fact an unusual agn.

astro-ph;0204383	dynamical confirmation of sdss weak lensing scaling laws	galaxy masses can be estimated by a variety of methods; each applicable indifferent circumstances, and each suffering from different systematicuncertainties. confirmation of results obtained by one technique with analysisby another is particularly important. recent sdss weak lensing measurements ofthe projected-mass correlation function reveal a linear relation between galaxyluminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 \hinvkpc scales). in this work we use an entirely independent dynamical method toconfirm these results. we begin by assembling a sample of 618 relativelyisolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially faintersatellites. we observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motionsof their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. dividing thesample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocitydispersion with host luminosity. we quantify these variations using a simpledynamical model, measuring \mtsd a dynamical mass within 260 \hinv kpc. theappropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similaranalysis within an n-body simulation. comparison between the dynamical andlensing mass-to-light scalings shows reasonable agreement, providing somequantitative confirmation for the lensing results.

astro-ph;0307126	on heavy element enrichment in classical novae	many classical nova ejecta are enriched in cno and ne. rosner et al. recentlysuggested that the enrichment might originate in the resonant interactionbetween large-scale shear flows in the accreted h/he envelope and gravity wavesat the interface between the envelope and the underlying c/o white dwarf. theshear flow amplifies the waves, which eventually form cusps and break. thiswave breaking injects a spray of c/o into the superincumbent h/he. usingtwo-dimensional simulations, we formulate a quantitative expression for theamount of c/o per unit area that can be entrained into the h/he at saturation.the fraction of the envelope that is enriched depends on the horizontaldistribution of shear velocity and the density contrast between the c/o whitedwarf and the h/he layer but is roughly independent of the vertical shape ofthe shear profile. using this parameterization for the mixed mass, we thenperform several one-dimensional lagrangian calculations of an accreting whitedwarf envelope and consider two scenarios: that the wave breaking and mixing isdriven by the convective flows; and that the mixing occurs prior to the onsetof convection. in the absence of enrichment prior to ignition, the base of theconvective zone, as calculated from mixing-length theory with the ledouxinstability criterion, does not reach the c/o interface. as a result, there isno additional mixing, and the runaway is slow. in contrast, the formation of amixed layer during the accretion of h/he, prior to ignition, causes a moreviolent runaway. the envelope can be enriched by &lt;25% of c/o by mass(consistent with that observed in some ejecta) for shear velocities, over thesurface, with mach numbers &lt;0.4.

astro-ph;0309455	hete-2 observations of the extremely soft x-ray flash xrf 020903	we report hete-2 wxm/fregate observations of the x-ray flash, xrf 020903.this event was extremely soft: the ratio log(s_x/s_gamma) = 0.7, where s_x ands_gamma are the fluences in the 2-30 and 30-400 kev energy bands, is the mostextreme value observed so far by hete-2. in addition, the spectrum has anobserved peak energy e^{obs}_{peak} &lt; 5.0 kev (99.7 % probability upper limit)and no photons were detected above ~10 kev. the burst is shorter at higherenergies, which is similar to the behavior of long grbs. we consider thepossibility that the burst lies at very high redshift and that the low value ofe^{obs}_{peak} is due to the cosmological redshift, and show that this is veryunlikely. we find that the properties of xrf 020903 are consistent with therelation between the fluences s(7-30 kev) and s(30-400 kev) found by barraud etal. for grbs and x-ray-rich grbs, and are consistent with the extension by adecade of the hardness-intensity correlation (mallozzi et al. 1995) found bythe same authors. assuming that xrf 020903 lies at a redshift z = 0.25 asimplied by the host galaxy of the candidate optical and radio afterglows ofthis burst, we find that the properties of xrf 020903 are consistent with anextension by a factor ~300 of the relation between the isotropic-equivalentenergy e_iso and the peak e_peak of the nu f_nu spectrum (in the source frameof the burst) found by amati et al. for grbs. the results presented in thispaper therefore provide evidence that xrfs, x-ray-rich grbs, and grbs form acontinuum and are a single phenomenon. the results also impose strongconstraints on models of xrfs and x-ray-rich grbs.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0312498	evidence from hete-2 for grb evolution with redshift	after taking into account threshold effects, we find that theisotropic-equivalent energies e_iso and luminosities l_iso of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) are correlated with redshift at the 5% and 0.9% signficance levels,respectively. our results are based on 10 bepposax grbs and 11 hete-2 grbs withknown redshifts. our results suggest that the isotropic-equivalent energies andluminosities of grbs increase with redshift. they strengthen earlier clues tothis effect from analyses of the batse catalog of grbs, using the variabilityof burst time histories as an estimator of burst luminosities (and thereforeredshifts), and from an analysis of bepposax bursts only. if theisotropic-equivalent energies and luminosities of grbs really do increase withredshift, it suggests that grb jets at high redshifts may be narrower and thusthe cores of grb progenitor stars at high redshifts may be rotating morerapidly. it also suggests that grbs at very high redshifts may be more luminous-- and therefore easier to detect -- than has been thought, which would makegrbs a more powerful probe of cosmology and the early universe than has beenthought.

astro-ph;0312502	gamma-ray bursts as a probe of the epoch of reionization	grbs are expected to occur at redshifts far higher than the highest quasarredshifts so far detected. and unlike quasars, grb afterglows may provide"clean" probes of the epoch of reionization because no complications (such asthe presence of a strong ly-alpha emission line) or "proximity effects" (suchas the stromgren sphere produced by ionizing photons from the quasar) areexpected. thus nir and optical observations of grb afterglows may provideunique information about the epoch of reionization. in particular, the flux atwavelengths shortward of ly-alpha provides a direct measure of the densityfluctuations of the igm at the grb redshift, while the flux at wavelengthslongward of ly-alpha provides an integrated measure of the number of ionizingphotons produced by stars in the host galaxy of the grb up until the burstoccurs. a comparison of the sizes of the stromgren spheres produced by stars inthe host galaxies of grbs and by quasars then provides an estimate of therelative contributions of star formation and quasars to reionization. we usedetailed calculations of the expected shape of the grb afterglow spectrum inthe vicinity of ly-alpha for grbs at a variety of redshifts to illustrate thesepoints.

astro-ph;0605516	grb 060121: implications of a short/intermediate duration gamma-ray  burst at high redshift	since the discovery of the first short-hard gamma-ray burst afterglows in2005, the handful of observed events have been found to be embedded in nearby(z &lt; 1), bright underlying galaxies. we present multiwavelength observations ofthe short-duration burst grb 060121, which is the first observed to clearlyoutshine its host galaxy (by a factor &gt;10^2). a photometric redshift for thisevent places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a lessprobable scenario of z = 1.7. in either case, grb 060121 could be thefarthermost short-duration grb detected to date and implies anisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen inlong-duration bursts. we discuss the implications of the released energy on thenature of the progenitor. these results suggest that grb 060121 may belong to afamily of energetic short-duration events, lying at z &gt; 1 and whose opticalafterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-durationgrbs observed in 2005. the possibility of grb 060121 being an intermediateduration burst is also discussed.

astro-ph;0605570	hete-2 localizations and observations of four short gamma-ray bursts:  grbs 010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121	here we report the localizations and properties of four short-duration grbslocalized by the high energy transient explorer 2 satellite (hete-2): grbs010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121, all of which were detected by the frenchgamma telescope (fregate) and localized with the wide-field x-ray monitor (wxm)and/or soft x-ray camera (sxc) instruments. we discuss eight possible criteriafor determining whether these grbs are "short population bursts" (spbs) or"long population bursts" (lpbs). these criteria are (1) duration, (2) pulsewidths, (3) spectral hardness, (4) spectral lag, (5) energy egamma radiated ingamma rays (or equivalently, the kinetic energy e_ke of the grb jet), (6)existence of a long, soft bump following the burst, (7) location of the burstin the host galaxy, and (8) type of host galaxy. in particular, we havedeveloped a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst isan spb or a lpb on the basis of its t90 duration alone. a striking feature ofthe resulting probability distribution is that the t90 duration at which aburst has an equal probability of being a spb or a lpb is t90 = 5 s, not t90 =2 s, as is often used. all four short-duration bursts discussed in detail inthis paper have t90 durations in the fregate 30-400 kev energy band of 1.90,2.31, 4.25, and 1.97 sec, respectively, yielding probabilities p(s|t90) = 0.97,0.91, 0.60, and 0.95 that these bursts are spbs on the basis of their t90durations alone. all four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero.these results provide strong evidence that all four grbs are spbs (abstractcontinues).

astro-ph;9601037	cyclotron line formation in a relativistic outflow	there is mounting evidence that, if gamma-ray bursters are galactic inorigin, they are located in a galactic corona at distances greater than 100kpc. this has created a need to explore new models of cyclotron line formation.in most previous calculations the line-forming region was modeled as a staticslab of plasma, optically thin to continuum scattering, and threaded by amagnetic field of the order $10^{12}$ gauss oriented normal to the slab. such amodel is appropriate, for example, for the magnetic polar cap of a neutron starwith a dipole field. however, if bursters lie at distances farther than severalhundred parsecs, the burst luminosity exceeds the magnetic eddingtonluminosity, and the plasma in a line-forming region at the magnetic polar capwould be ejected relativistically along the field lines. mitrofanov and tsyganhave modeled the dynamics of such an outflow, and miller {\it et al.} havecalculated the properties of the cyclotron second and third harmonics,approximating them as due to cyclotron absorption. here we describe monte carlocalculations of cyclotron resonant scattering at the first three harmonics in arelativistic outflow from the magnetic polar cap, and show that such scatteringcan produce narrow lines like those observed by ginga.

astro-ph;9703075	effects of the geometry of the line-forming region on the properties of  cyclotron resonant scattering lines	we use a monte carlo radiative transfer code to examine the dependence of theproperties of cyclotron resonant scattering lines on the spatial geometry andthe optical depth of the line-forming region. we focus most of our attention ona line-forming region that is a plane-parallel slab. we also consider acylindrical line-forming region. in both cases, the line-forming regioncontains an electron-proton plasma at the equilibrium compton temperature,$t_c$, and is threaded with a uniform magnetic field with strength $\sim10^{12}$ gauss. we consider geometries in which the photon source illuminatesthe line-forming region from below, and in which the photon source is embeddedin the line-forming region. our findings have implications foraccretion-powered pulsars and gamma-ray bursters. in particular, the absence ofpronounced shoulders on each side of the cyclotron first harmonic line in thespectra of accretion-powered pulsars suggests that the line-forming region iseither illuminated from below and outside, as would be the case if it wereplasma suspended in the magnetosphere of the neutron star, or it has a large($\tau_{to} \gtrsim 10$) optical depth. also, the ability of a slabline-forming region in which the magnetic field is parallel to the slab toproduce narrow lines with large $w_e$ suggests that the lines observed in thex-ray spectra of some gamma-ray bursts might be able to be formed in plasmatrapped at the magnetic equator of a neutron star.

astro-ph;9707224	cyclotron line formation in a radiation-driven outflow	we calculate the properties of gamma-ray burst spectral lines formed byresonant cyclotron scattering in a radiation-driven outflow. most previousmodels of line formation in gamma-ray bursts are appropriate at the polar capof a neutron star located no further than several hundred parsecs away.however, the batse brightness and sky distributions indicate that, if burstersare galactic, they are located in a corona at distances greater than 100 kpc.at these distances the burst luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity andthe plasma in a polar line-forming region is ejected along the field lines. thevariation of the magnetic field strength and plasma velocity with altitude insuch an outflow would seem to prevent the formation of narrow features likethose observed by ginga and other instruments. however, this is not the casebecause the majority of scatters occur close to the stellar surface, ataltitudes below $z \approx r_h$, where $r_h \sim 10^{5}$ cm is the size of thephoton source. consequently, the interpretation of the observed features ascyclotron lines does not rule out burst sources in a galactic corona. theoutflow model predicts both absorption-like and single-peaked emission-likefeatures. the latter do not occur in models with static line-forming regions,but have been observed in gamma-ray bursts by the konus and batse instruments.

astro-ph;9803324	the galactic extinction toward grb 970228 and its implications for the  point-like and extended optical sources	the iras 100 micron image of the grb 970228 field shows that the amount ofgalactic dust in this direction is substantial and varies on arcminute angularscales. from an analysis of the observed surface density of galaxies in the$2.6' \times 2.6'$ hst wfpc image of the grb 970228 field, we find $a_v = 1.1\pm 0.10$. from an analysis of the observed spectra of three stars in the grb970228 field, we find $a_v = 1.71^{+0.20}_{-0.40}$. this value may representthe best estimate of the extinction in the direction of grb 970228, since thesethree stars lie only $2.7''$, $16''$, and $42''$ away from the opticaltransient. if instead we combine the two results, we obtain a conservativevalue $a_v = 1.3 \pm 0.2$. this value is significantly larger than the values$a_v = 0.4 - 0.8$ used in papers to date. the value of $a_v$ that we findimplies that, if the extended source in the burst error circle is extragalacticand therefore lies beyond the dust in our own galaxy, its optical spectrum isvery blue: its observed color $(v-i_c)_{obs} \approx 0.65^{+0.74}_{-0.94}$ isconsistent only with a starburst galaxy, an irregular galaxy at $z &gt; 1.5$, or aspiral galaxy at $z &gt; 2$. on the other hand, its observed color and surfacebrightness $\mu_v \approx 24.5$ arcsec$^{-2}$ are similar to those expected forthe reflected light from a dust cloud in our own galaxy, if the cloud lies infront of most of the dust in this direction.

(1999b). thesemethodologies utilize the information present in the data to select thesimplest model that adequately describes the data from among a wide range ofcontinuum and continuum-plus-line(s) models. this ensures that the chosen modeldoes not include free parameters that the data deem unnecessary and that wouldact to reduce the frequentist significance and bayesian odds of thecontinuum-plus-line(s) model. we calculate the significance of thecontinuum-plus-line(s) models using the chi-square maximum likelihood ratiotest. we describe a parametrization of the exponentiated gaussian absorptionline shape that makes the probability surface in parameter spacebetter-behaved, allowing us to estimate analytically the bayesian odds. thesignificance of the continuum-plus-line models requested by the s1 and s2 dataare 3.6 x 10^-5 and 1.7 x 10^-4 respectively, with the odds favoring them being114:1 and 7:1. we also apply our methodology to the combined (s1+s2) data. thesignificance of the continuum-plus-lines model requested by the combined datais 4.2 x 10^-8, with the odds favoring it being 40,300:1.

(1988,1989b), wemodel line formation by injecting continuum photons into a staticplane-parallel slab of electrons threaded by a strong neutron star magneticfield (~ 10^12 g) which may be oriented at an arbitrary angle relative to theslab normal. we examine two source geometries, which we denote "1-0" and "1-1,"with the numbers representing the relative electron column densities above andbelow the continuum photon source plane. we compare azimuthally symmetricmodels, i.e. models in which the magnetic field is parallel to the slab normal,with models having more general magnetic field orientations. if the burstingsource has a simple dipole field, these two model classes represent lineformation at the magnetic pole, or elsewhere on the stellar surface. we findthat the data of s1 and s2, considered individually, are consistent with bothgeometries, and with all magnetic field orientations, with the exception thatthe s1 data clearly favor line formation away from a polar cap in the 1-1geometry, with the best-fit model placing the line-forming region at themagnetic equator. within both geometries, fits to the combined (s1+s2) datamarginally favor models which feature equatorial line formation, and in whichthe observer's orientation with respect to the slab changes between the twoepochs. we interpret this change as being due to neutron star rotation, and weplace limits on the rotation period.
