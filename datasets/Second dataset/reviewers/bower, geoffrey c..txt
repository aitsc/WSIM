0901.3723	jet-lag in sgr a*: what size and timing measurements tell us about the  central black hole in the milky way	the black hole at the galactic center, sgr a*, is the prototype of a galacticnucleus at a very low level of activity. its radio through submm-wave emissionis known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the sourceof the emission is still under debate. a successful theory explaining theemission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerfulquasars. we want to test the predictive power of this established jet modelagainst newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and thesize-wavelength structure in sgr a*. using all available closure amplitude vlbidata from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependentsize of sgr a*. this allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependenttime lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities.moreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously publishedpressure-driven jet model. the predicted lags are then compared to radiomonitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 ghz. the combination of time lagsand size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflowspeeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. the newly measured time lags are reproduced wellby the jet model without any major fine tuning. the results further strengthenthe case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in sgr a* as coming from a mildlyrelativistic jet-like outflow. the combination of radio time lag and vlbiclosure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flowspeed and direction in sgr a*. future vlbi and time lag measurements over arange of wavelengths will reveal more information about sgr a*, such as theexistence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of arelativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.

0902.1527	astro2010 decadal survey whitepaper: coordinated science in the  gravitational and electromagnetic skies	it is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first directdetection of gravitational waves (gws). the ground-based ligo and virgo gwobservatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected toobserve a significant binary merger rate. the launch of the laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) would extend the gw window to lowfrequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (m &gt;~10^5 m_sun) black holes. gw events are likely to be accompanied byelectromagnetic (em) counterparts and, since information carriedelectromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a greatdeal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possibleto measure both forms of radiation in concert. measurements of this kind willmark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectralbands of information. the aim of this whitepaper is to articulate futuredirections in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broadastrophysical inquiries of general interest. what will em observations reflecton the nature and diversity of gw sources? can gw sources be exploited ascomplementary probes of cosmology? what cross-facility coordination will expandthe science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

0906.3899	imaging an event horizon: submm-vlbi of a super massive black hole	a long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediateenvironment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the eventhorizon. realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of generalrelativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at theedge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental blackhole physics (e.g., spin). steady long-term progress on improving thecapability of very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) at short wavelengths hasnow made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the nextdecade. the most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by1.3mm vlbi of schwarzschild radius scale structure in sgra*, the compact sourceof radio, submm, nir and xrays at the center of the milky way. sgra* is thoughtto mark the position of a ~4 million solar mass black hole, and because of itsproximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon sizeof any black hole candidate in the universe. over the next decade, existing andplanned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, highangular resolution "event horizon telescope" that will bring us as close to theedge of black hole as we will come for decades. this white paper describes thescience case for mm/submm vlbi observations of both sgra* and m87 (a radio loudagn of a much more luminous class that sgra*). we emphasize that while there isdevelopment and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, andthe recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that wouldnormally be associated with such an ambitious project.

0912.0014	evaluating the calorimeter model with broadband, continuous spectra of  starburst galaxies observed with the allen telescope array	although the relationship between the far-infrared and cm-wave radioluminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations inastronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. in oneinterpretation, the "calorimeter model," rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmicray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship.observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooledsynchrotron emission. in thompson et al. (2006), a simple parameterized modelis presented to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might ariseeven in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionizationlosses and other cooling mechanisms. during the commissioning of the 42-elementallen telescope array, we observed the starburst galaxies m82, ngc 253, and arp220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 ghz, obtaining unprecedented broadbandcontinuous radio spectra of these sources. we combine our observations withhigh-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermaland nonthermal components. the nonthermal components all steepen in the cm-waveregime and cannot be well-modeled as simple power laws. the model of thompsonet al. is consistent with our m82 results when plausible parameters are chosen,and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed modelparameters. the model is only marginally consistent with our ngc 253 data.assuming the thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index ofp = -2.5 is ruled out in m82 and ngc 253 to &gt;99% confidence. we describe indetail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistencychecks used for broadband spectral observations with the allen telescope array.

1010.1064	primary beam shape calibration from mosaicked, interferometric  observations	image quality in mosaicked observations from interferometric radio telescopesis strongly dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna primary beam iscalibrated. the next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the allentelescope array (ata) and the square kilometer array (ska) have key sciencegoals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright pointsources. we present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope'smean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these brightsources in the mosaic. the method has an analytical solution for simplegaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapesthrough $\chi^2$ minimization. one major benefit of this simple, conceptuallyclean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes,thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneouscalibration and observation. we apply the method both to 1.43 ghz data takenduring the ata twenty centimeter survey (atats) and to 3.14 ghz data takenduring the ata's pi gigahertz sky survey (pigss). we find that the beam'scalculated full width at half maximum (fwhm) values are consistent with thetheoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and thevalues from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of ourmethod on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ata and the ska.these results are preliminary, and can be expanded upon by fitting more complexbeam shapes. we also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of theaccuracy of the telescope's fwhm on antenna number. we find that theuncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to thenumber of antennas in the array.

1112.0308	all transients, all the time: real-time radio transient detection with  interferometric closure quantities	we demonstrate a new technique for detecting radio transients based oninterferometric closure quantities. the technique uses the bispectrum, theproduct of visibilities around a closed-loop of baselines of an interferometer.the bispectrum is calibration independent, resistant to interference, andcomputationally efficient, so it can be built into correlators for real-timetransient detection. our technique could find celestial transients anywhere inthe field of view and localize them to arcsecond precision. at the karl g.jansky very large array (vla), such a system would have a high survey speed anda 5-sigma sensitivity of 38 mjy on 10 ms timescales with 1 ghz of bandwidth.the ability to localize dispersed millisecond pulses to arcsecond precision inlarge volumes of interferometer data has several unique science applications.localizing individual pulses from galactic pulsars will help find x-raycounterparts that define their physical properties, while finding host galaxiesof extragalactic transients will measure the electron density of theintergalactic medium with a single dispersed pulse. exoplanets and active starshave distinct millisecond variability that can be used to identify them andprobe their magnetospheres. we use millisecond time scale visibilities from theallen telescope array (ata) and vla to show that the bispectrum can detectdispersed pulses and reject local interference. the computational and dataefficiency of the bispectrum will help find transients on a range of timescales with next-generation radio interferometers.

1201.1525	comparison of rfi mitigation strategies for dispersed pulse detection	impulsive radio-frequency signals from astronomical sources are dispersed bythe frequency dependent index of refraction of the interstellar media and soappear as chirped signals when they reach earth. searches for dispersedimpulses have been limited by false detections due to radio frequencyinterference (rfi) and, in some cases, artifacts of the instrumentation. manyauthors have discussed techniques to excise or mitigate rfi in searches forfast transients, but comparisons between different approaches are lacking. thiswork develops rfi mitigation techniques for use in searches for dispersedpulses, employing data recorded in a "fly's eye" mode of the allen telescopearray as a test case. we gauge the performance of several rfi mitigationtechniques by adding dispersed signals to data containing rfi and comparingfalse alarm rates at the observed signal-to-noise ratios of the added signals.we find that huber filtering is most effective at removing broadbandinterferers, while frequency centering is most effective at removing narrowfrequency interferers. neither of these methods is effective over a broad rangeof interferers. a method that combines huber filtering and adaptiveinterference cancellation provides the lowest number of false positives overthe interferers considered here. the methods developed here have application toother searches for dispersed pulses in incoherent spectra, especially thoseinvolving multiple beam systems.

1208.4402	resolving the inner jet structure of 1924-292 with the event horizon  telescope	we present the first 1.3 mm (230 ghz) very long baseline interferometry modelimage of an agn jet using closure phase techniques with a four-element array.the model image of the quasar 1924-292 was obtained with four telescopes atthree observatories: the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) on mauna kea inhawaii, the arizona radio observatory's submillimeter telescope (smt) inarizona, and two telescopes of the combined array for research inmillimeterwave astronomy (carma) in california in april 2009. with the greatlyimproved resolution compared with previous observations and robust closurephase measurement, the inner jet structure of 1924-292 was spatially resolved.the inner jet extends to the northwest along a position angle of $-53^\circ$ ata distance of 0.38\,mas from the tentatively identified core, in agreement withthe inner jet structure inferred from lower frequencies, and making a positionangle difference of $\sim 80^{\circ}$ with respect to the cm-jet. the size ofthe compact core is 0.15\,pc with a brightness temperature of$1.2\times10^{11}$\,k. compared with those measured at lower frequencies, thelow brightness temperature may argue in favor of the decelerating jet model orparticle-cascade models. the successful measurement of closure phase paves theway for imaging and time resolving sgr a* and nearby agn with the event horizontelescope.

1208.6056	the rrat trap: interferometric localization of radio pulses from  j0628+0909	we present the first blind interferometric detection and imaging of amillisecond radio transient with an observation of transient pulsar j0628+0909.we developed a special observing mode of the karl g. jansky very large array(vla) to produce correlated data products (i.e., visibilities and images) on atime scale of 10 ms. correlated data effectively produce thousands of beams onthe sky that can localize sources anywhere over a wide field of view. we usedthis new observing mode to find and image pulses from the rotating radiotransient (rrat) j0628+0909, improving its localization by two orders ofmagnitude. since the location of the rrat was only approximately known whenfirst observed, we searched for transients using a wide-field detectionalgorithm based on the bispectrum, an interferometric closure quantity. over 16minutes of observing, this algorithm detected one transient offset roughly 1'from its nominal location; this allowed us to image the rrat to localize itwith an accuracy of 1.6". with a priori knowledge of the rrat location, atraditional beamforming search of the same data found two, lower significancepulses. the refined rrat position excludes all potential multiwavelengthcounterparts, limiting its optical luminosity to l_i'&lt;1.1x10^31 erg/s andexcluding its association with a young, luminous neutron star.

1210.0020	late time radio emission from x-ray selected tidal disruption events	we present new observations with the karl g. jansky very large array of sevenx-ray-selected tidal disruption events (tdes). the radio observations werecarried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial x-ray discovery, and,thus, probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactionswith the interstellar medium in these systems. we detect a compact radio sourcein the nucleus of the galaxy ic 3599 and a compact radio source that is apossible counterpart to rx j1420.4+5334. we find no radio counterparts for fiveother sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 microjy (3sigma). if the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with atde, then our results suggest that a fraction &gt;~ 10% of x-ray-detected tdes areaccompanied by relativistic jets. we explore several models for producing lateradio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclearenvironment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself.upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest thatthe jet formation may have been delayed for years after the tde, possiblytriggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of ~10^{-2} -- 10^{-3} mdot_edd. the non-detections are also consistent with thisscenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets arepresent in these systems. the emission from rx j1420.4+5334 is also consistentwith the predictions of the blast wave model, however the radio emission fromic 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat,relative to the blast wave model expectations. future radio monitoring of ic3599 and rx j1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the jetsin these systems.

1210.8246	primary beam and dish surface characterization at the allen telescope  array by radio holography	the allen telescope array (ata) is a cm-wave interferometer in california,comprising 42 antenna elements with 6-m diameter dishes. we characterize theantenna optical accuracy using two-antenna interferometry and radio holography.the distortion of each telescope relative to the average is small, with rmsdifferences of 1 percent of beam peak value. holography provides images of dishillumination pattern, allowing characterization of as-built mirror surfaces.the ata dishes can experience mm-scale distortions across -2 meter lengths dueto mounting stresses or solar radiation. experimental rms errors are 0.7 mm atnight and 3 mm under worst case solar illumination. for frequencies 4, 10, and15 ghz, the nighttime values indicate sensitivity losses of 1, 10 and 20percent, respectively. the ata.s exceptional wide-bandwidth permitsobservations over a continuous range 0.5 to 11.2 ghz, and future retrofits mayincrease this range to 15 ghz. beam patterns show a slowly varying focusfrequency dependence. we probe the antenna optical gain and beam patternstability as a function of focus and observation frequency, concluding that atacan produce high fidelity images over a decade of simultaneous observationfrequencies. in the day, the antenna sensitivity and pointing accuracy areaffected. we find that at frequencies greater than 5 ghz, daytime observationsgreater than 5 ghz will suffer some sensitivity loss and it may be necessary tomake antenna pointing corrections on a 1 to 2 hourly basis.

1212.4698	bright radio emission from an ultraluminous stellar-mass microquasar in  m31	a subset of ultraluminous x-ray sources (those with luminosities &lt; 10^40erg/s) are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto black holes withmasses of ~5-20 m_solar, probably via an accretion disc. the x-ray and radioemission are coupled in such galactic sources, with the radio emissionoriginating in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermostregions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring when therate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the eddingtonlimit). only four such maximal sources are known in the milky way, and theabsorption of soft x-rays in the interstellar medium precludes determining thecausal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. here we reportradio and x-ray observations of a bright new x-ray source whose peak luminositycan exceed 10^39 erg/s in the nearby galaxy, m31. the radio luminosity isextremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguingthat the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to theeddington limit onto a stellar mass black hole. continued radio and x-raymonitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between theaccretion flow and the powerful jet emission.

1305.3359	fine-scale structure of the quasar 3c 279 measured with 1.3 mm very long  baseline interferometry	we report results from 5-day vlbi observations of the well-known quasar 3c279 at 1.3 mm (230 ghz) in 2011. the measured nonzero closure phases ontriangles including stations in arizona, california and hawaii indicate thatthe source structure is spatially resolved. we find an unusual inner jetdirection at scales of $\sim$1 parsec extending along the northwest-southeastdirection (pa = $127^{\circ}\pm3^{\circ}$), as opposed to other (previously)reported measurements on scales of a few parsecs showing inner jet directionextending to the southwest. the 1.3 mm structure corresponds closely with thatobserved in the central region of quasi-simultaneous super-resolution vlbaimages at 7 mm. the closure phase changed significantly on the last day whencompared with the rest of observations, indicating that the inner jet structuremay be variable on daily timescales. the observed new direction of the innerjet shows inconsistency with the prediction of a class of jet precessionmodels. our observations indicate a brightness temperature of $\sim8\times10^{10}$ k in the 1.3 mm core, much lower than that at centimeterwavelengths. observations with better uv coverage and sensitivity in the comingyears will allow the discrimination between different structure models and willprovide direct images of the inner regions of the jet with 20--30 $\mu$as (5--7light months) resolution.

1308.5968	an 8 hour characteristic time-scale in submillimetre light curves of  sagittarius a*	we compile and analyse long term (~10 year) submillimetre (1.3, 0.87, 0.43mm, submm) wavelength light curves of the galactic centre black hole,sagittarius a*. the 0.87 and 0.43 mm data are taken from the literature, whilethe majority of the 1.3 mm light curve is from previously unpublished sma andcarma data. we use monte carlo simulations to show that on minute to few hourtime-scales the variability is consistent with a red noise process with a 230ghz power spectrum slope of 2.3+0.8-0.6 at 95% confidence. the light curve isde-correlated (white noise) on very long (month to year) times. in order toidentify the transition time between red and white noise, we model the lightcurves as a stochastic damped random walk process. the models allow aquantitative estimate of this physical characteristic time-scale of 8-4+3 hoursat 230 ghz at 95% confidence, with consistent results at 345 and 690 ghz. thiscorresponds to ~10 orbital times or ~1 inflow (viscous) time at r = 3 rs, atypical radius producing the 230 ghz emission as measured by very long baselineinterferometry and found in theoretical accretion flow and jet models. thistime-scale is significantly shorter (longer) than those measured at radio(near-infrared, nir) wavelengths, and is marginally inconsistent with the samevariability mechanism operating in the submm and nir for the expected t ~ r^3/2scaling. it is crudely consistent with the analogous time-scale inferred instudies of quasar optical light curves after accounting for the difference inemission radius. we find evidence that the submm variability persists at leastdown to the isco, if not the event horizon. these results can be comparedquantitatively with similar analyses at different wavebands to test forconnections between the variability mechanisms, and with light curves fromtheoretical models of accreting black holes.

1309.4672	the angular broadening of the galactic center pulsar sgr j1745-29: a new  constraint on the scattering medium	the pulsed radio emission from the galactic center (gc) magnetar sgr j1745-29probes the turbulent, magnetized plasma of the gc hyperstrong scattering screenthrough both angular and temporal broadening. we present the first measurementsof the angular size of sgr j1745-29, obtained with the very long baseline arrayand the phased very large array at 8.7 and 15.4 ghz. the source sizes areconsistent with the scatter--broadened size of sagittarius a* at eachfrequency, demonstrating that sgr j1745-29 is also located behind the samehyperstrong scattering medium. combining the angular broadening with temporalscattering obtained from pulsar observations provides a complete picture of thescattering properties. if the scattering occurs in a thin screen, then it mustbe at a distance \delta &gt;~ 5 kpc. a best-fit solution for the distance of athin screen is \delta=5.9 +/-0.3 kpc, consistent with being located in thescutum spiral arm. this is a substantial revision of the previously held modelin which the scattering screen is located very close to the gc. as alsodiscussed in spitler et al., these results suggest that gc searches can detectmillisecond pulsars gravitationally bound to sgr a* with observations at &gt;~ 10ghz and ordinary pulsars at even lower frequencies.

1310.4506	constraints on long-lived remnants of neutron star binary mergers from  late-time radio observations of short duration gamma-ray bursts	the coalescence of a binary neutron star (ns) system may in some casesproduce a massive ns remnant that is long-lived and, potentially, indefinitelystable to gravitational collapse. such a remnant has been proposed as anexplanation for the late x-ray emission observed following some short durationgamma-ray bursts (grbs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to thegravitational wave chirp. a stable ns merger remnant necessarily possesses alarge rotational energy &gt; 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimatelydeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (cbm) at mildly relativisticvelocities. we present very large array radio observations of 7 short grbs,some of which possessed temporally extended x-ray emission, on timescales of~1-3 years following the initial burst. no radio sources were detected, withtypical upper limits ~0.3 mjy at 1.4 ghz. a basic model for the synchrotronemission from the blast wave is used to constrain the presence of a long-livedns merger remnant in each system. depending on the grb, our non-detectionstranslate into upper limits on the cbm density n &lt; 3e-2 - 3e-3 particles/cm^3required for consistency with the remnant hypothesis. our upper limits rule outa long-lived remnant in grb 050724 and 060505, but cannot rule out such aremnant in other systems due to their lower inferred cbm densities based onafterglow modeling or the lack of such constraints. additional vla observationsin the near future could place tighter limits on the presence of mergerremnants in these system. the population of long-lived ns merger remnants willalso be constrained by their (non-)detection with upcoming radio transientsurveys.

(2) outflowsappear to be randomly aligned with b-fields; although, in sources with lowpolarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentiallyperpendicular to small-scale b-fields, which suggests that in these sources thefields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) finally, even at ~2.5"resolution we see the so-called "polarization hole" effect, where thefractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak. alldata are publicly available in the electronic edition of this article.

1405.1456	the intrinsic two-dimensional size of sagittarius a*	we report the detection of the two-dimensional structure of the radio sourceassociated with the galactic center black hole, sagittarius a*, obtained fromvery long baseline array (vlba) observations at a wavelength of 7mm. theintrinsic source is modeled as an elliptical gaussian with major axis size 35.4x 12.6 r_s in position angle 95 deg east of north. this morphology can beinterpreted in the context of both jet and accretion disk models for the radioemission. there is supporting evidence in large angular-scale multi-wavelengthobservations for both source models for a preferred axis near 95 deg. we alsoplace a maximum peak-to-peak change of 15% in the intrinsic major axis sizeover five different epochs. three observations were triggered by detection ofnear infrared (nir) flares and one was simultaneous with a large x-ray flaredetected by nustar. the absence of simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous flaresindicates that not all high energy events produce variability at radiowavelengths. this supports the conclusion that nir and x-ray flares areprimarily due to electron excitation and not to an enhanced accretion rate ontothe black hole.

1411.7407	parsec-scale magnetic fields in arp 220	we present the first very-long-baseline interferometry (vlbi) detections ofzeeman splitting in another galaxy. we used arecibo observatory, the green banktelescope, and the very long baseline array to perform dual-polarizationobservations of oh maser lines in the merging galaxy arp 220. we measuredmagnetic fields of $\sim$1-5 mg associated with three roughly parsec-sizedclouds in the nuclear regions of arp 220. our measured magnetic fields havecomparable strengths and the same direction as features at the same velocityidentified in previous zeeman observations with arecibo alone. the agreementbetween single dish and vlbi results provides critical validation of previouszeeman splitting observations of oh megamasers that used a single large dish.the measured magnetic field strengths indicate that magnetic energy densitiesare comparable to gravitational energy in oh maser clouds. we also compare ourtotal intensity results to previously published vlbi observations of ohmegamasers in arp 220. we find evidence for changes in both structure andamplitude of the oh maser lines that are most easily explained by variabilityintrinsic to the masing region, rather than variability produced byinterstellar scintillation. our results demonstrate the potential for usinghigh-sensitivity vlbi to study magnetic fields on small spatial scales inextragalactic systems.

1412.7536	a millisecond interferometric search for fast radio bursts with the very  large array	we report on the first millisecond timescale radio interferometric search forthe new class of transient known as fast radio bursts (frbs). we used the verylarge array (vla) for a 166-hour, millisecond imaging campaign to detect andprecisely localize an frb. we observed at 1.4 ghz and produced visibilitieswith 5 ms time resolution over 256 mhz of bandwidth. dedispersed images weresearched for transients with dispersion measures from 0 to 3000 pc/cm3. notransients were detected in observations of high galactic latitude fields takenfrom september 2013 though october 2014. observations of a known pulsar showthat images typically had a thermal-noise limited sensitivity of 120 mjy/beam(8 sigma; stokes i) in 5 ms and could detect and localize transients over awide field of view. our nondetection limits the frb rate to less than7e4/sky/day (95% confidence) above a fluence limit of 1.2 jy-ms. assuming aeuclidean flux distribution, the vla rate limit is inconsistent with thepublished rate of thornton et al. we recalculate previously published rateswith a homogeneous consideration of the effects of primary beam attenuation,dispersion, pulse width, and sky brightness. this revises the frb rate downwardand shows that the vla observations had a roughly 60% chance of detecting atypical frb and that a 95% confidence constraint would require roughly 500hours of similar vla observing. our survey also limits the repetition rate ofan frb to 2 times less than any known repeating millisecond radio transient.

1502.03423	alma and vla measurements of frequency-dependent time lags in  sagittarius a*: evidence for a relativistic outflow	radio and mm-wavelength observations of sagittarius a* (sgr a*), the radiosource associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy,show that it behaves as a partially self-absorbed synchrotron-emitting source.the measured size of sgr a* shows that the mm-wavelength emission comes from asmall region and consists of the inner accretion flow and a possible collimatedoutflow. existing observations of sgr a* have revealed a time lag between lightcurves at 43 ghz and 22 ghz, which is consistent with a rapidly expandingplasma flow and supports the presence of a collimated outflow from theenvironment of an accreting black hole.  here we wish to measure simultaneous frequency-dependent time lags in thelight curves of sgr a* across a broad frequency range to constrain directionand speed of the radio-emitting plasma in the vicinity of the black hole. lightcurves of sgr a* were taken in may 2012 using alma at 100 ghz using the vla at48, 39, 37, 27, 25.5, and 19 ghz. as a result of elevation limits and thelongitude difference between the stations, the usable overlap in the lightcurves is approximately four hours. although sgr a* was in a relatively quietphase, the high sensitivity of alma and the vla allowed us to detect and fitmaxima of an observed minor flare where flux density varied by ~10%.  the fitted times of flux density maxima at frequencies from 100 ghz to 19ghz, as well as a cross-correlation analysis, reveal a simplefrequency-dependent time lag relation where maxima at higher frequencies leadthose at lower frequencies. taking the observed size-frequency relation of sgra* into account, these time lags suggest a moderately relativistic (lowerestimates: 0.5c for two-sided, 0.77c for one-sided) collimated outflow.

astro-ph;0111356	the power of jets: new clues from radio circular polarization and x-rays	jets are ubiquitous in accreting black holes. often ignored, they may be amajor contributor to the emitted spectral energy distribution for sub-eddingtonblack holes. for example, recent observations of radio-to-x-ray correlationsand broad band spectra of x-ray binaries in the low/hard state can be explainedby a significant synchrotron contribution from jets also to their ir-to-x-rayspectrum as proposed by markoff, falcke, fender 2001. this model can alsoexplain state-transitions from low/hard to high/soft states. relativisticbeaming of the jet x-ray emission could lead to the appearance of seeminglysuper-eddington x-rays sources in other galaxies. we show that a simplepopulation synthesis model of x-ray binaries with relativistic beaming can wellexplain the currently found distribution of off-nucleus x-ray point sources innearby galaxies. specifically we suggest that the so-called ultra-luminousx-ray sources (ulxs, also ixos) could well be relativistically beamedmicroblazars. the same model that can be used to explain x-ray binaries alsofits low-luminosity agn (llagn) and especially sgr a* in the galactic center.the recent detection of significant circular polarization in agn radio cores,ranging from bright quasars down to low-luminosity agn like m81*, sgr a* andeven x-ray binaries, now places additional new constraints on the mattercontents of such jets. the emerging picture are powerful jets with a mix of hotand cold matter, a net magnetic flux, and a stable magnetic north pole.

astro-ph;0202138	the spectrum and variability of circular polarization in sagittarius a*  from 1.4 to 15 ghz	we report here multi-epoch, multi-frequency observations of the circularpolarization in sagittarius a*, the compact radio source in the galacticcenter. data taken from the vla archive indicate that the fractional circularpolarization at 4.8 ghz was -0.31% with an rms scatter of 0.13% from 1981 to1998, in spite of a factor of 2 change in the total intensity. the signremained negative over the entire time range, indicating a stable magneticfield polarity. in the summer of 1999 we obtained 13 epochs of vla a-arrayobservations at 1.4, 4.8, 8.4 and 15 ghz. in may, september and october of 1999we obtained 11 epochs of australia telescope compact array observations at 4.8and 8.5 ghz. in all three of the data sets, we find no evidence for linearpolarization greater than 0.1% in spite of strong circular polarizationdetections. both vla and atca data sets support three conclusions regarding thefractional circular polarization: the average spectrum is inverted with aspectral index ~0.5 +/- 0.2; the degree of variability is roughly constant ontimescales of days to years; and, the degree of variability increases withfrequency. we also observed that the largest increase in fractional circularpolarization was coincident with the brightest flare in total intensity.significant variability in the total intensity and fractional circularpolarization on a timescale of 1 hour was observed during this flare,indicating an upper limit to the size of 70 au at 15 ghz. the fractionalcircular polarization at 15 ghz reached -1.1% and the spectral index isstrongly inverted during this flare. we conclude that the spectrum has twocomponents that match the high and low frequency total intensity components.(abridged)

astro-ph;0209123	a radio survey for linear and circular polarization in low luminosity  active galactic nuclei	we conducted a very large array survey of eleven low luminosity activegalactic nuclei for linear and circular polarization at 8.4 ghz. we detectedcircular polarization in one source (m81*) and linear polarization in 3sources. sensitivity limits were ~0.1% for both modes of polarization in 9 of11 sources. the detections confirm the importance of nonthermal emission inllagn. however, detection rates for circular and linear polarization are lowerfor these sources than for more powerful agn. fractional linear polarization indetected sources is also lower than in more powerful agn. the weak linearpolarization in the survey sources indicates their overall similarity to sgra*. confusion with thermal sources, depolarization and weaker, less extendedjets may contribute to these differences. we detect a rotation measure &gt;~ 7 x10^4 rad m^-2 for ngc 4579. this may arise from magnetized plasma in theaccretion, outflow or interstellar regions. inverted spectra are present inboth m81* and sagittarius a* and absent from all sources in which circularpolarization is not detected. this suggests that optical depth effects areimportant in the creation of circular polarization.

astro-ph;0302227	interferometric detection of linear polarization from sagittarius a* at  230 ghz	we measured the linear polarization of sagittarius a* to be 7.2 +/- 0.6 % at230 ghzusing the bima array with a resolution of 3.6 x 0.9 arcsec. thisconfirms the previously reported detection with the jcmt 14-m antenna. our highresolution observations demonstrate that the polarization does not arise fromdust but from a synchrotron source associated with sgr a*. we see no change inthe polarization position angle and only a small change in the polarizationfraction in four observations distributed over 60 days. we find a positionangle 139 +/- 4 degrees that differs substantially from what was found inearlier jcmt observations at the same frequency. polarized dust emission cannotaccount for this discrepancy leaving variability and observational error as theonly explanations. the bima observations alone place an upper limit on themagnitude of the rotation measure of 2 x 10^6 rad m^-2. these new observationswhen combined with the jcmt observations at 150, 375 and 400 ghz suggest rm=-4.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^5 rad m^-2. this rm may be caused by an external faradayscreen. barring a special geometry or a high number of field reversals, this rmrules out accretion rates greater than ~ 10^-7 m_sun y^-1. this measurement isinconsistent with high accretion rates necessary in standard advectiondominated accretion flow and bondi-hoyle models for sgr a*. it argues for lowaccretion rates as a major factor in the overall faintness of sgr a*.

astro-ph;0308277	a giant outburst at millimeter wavelengths in the orion nebula	bima observations of the orion nebula discovered a giant flare from a youngstar previously undetected at millimeter wavelengths. the star briefly becamethe brightest compact object in the nebula at 86 ghz. its flux densityincreased by more than a factor of 5 on a timescale of hours, to a peak of 160mjy. this is one of the most luminous stellar radio flares ever observed.remarkably, the chandra x-ray observatory was in the midst of a deepintegration of the orion nebula at the time of the bima discovery; the source'sx-ray flux increased by a factor of 10 approximately 2 days before the radiodetection. follow-up radio observations with the vla and bima showed that thesource decayed on a timescale of days, then flared again several times over thenext 70 days, although never as brightly as during the discovery. circularpolarization was detected at 15, 22, and 43 ghz, indicating that the emissionmechanism was cyclotron. vlba observations 9 days after the initial flare yielda brightness temperature tb &gt; 5 x 10^7 k at 15 ghz. infrared spectroscopyindicates the source is a k5v star with faint br gamma emission, suggestingthat it is a weak-line t tauri object. zeeman splitting measurements in theinfrared spectrum find b ~ 2.6 +/- 1.0 kg. the flare is an extreme example ofmagnetic activity associated with a young stellar object. these data suggestthat short observations obtained with alma will uncover hundreds of flaringyoung stellar objects in the orion region.

astro-ph;0403104	modeling the counts of faint radio loud quasars: constraints on the  supermassive black hole population and predictions for high redshift	we use a physically motivated semi-analytic model, based on the mass functionof dark matter halos, to predict the number of radio-loud quasars as a functionof redshift and luminosity. simple models in which the central bh mass scaleswith the velocity dispersion of its host halo as m(bh) sigma(halo)^5 have beenpreviously found to be consistent with a number of observations, including theoptical and x-ray quasar luminosity functions. we find that similar models,when augmented with an empirical prescription for radio emission, overpredictthe number of faint (10 micro-jy) radio sources by 1-2 orders of magnitude.this translates into a more stringent constraint on the low-mass end of thequasar black hole mass function than is available from the hubble and chandradeep fields. we interpret this discrepancy as evidence that black holes withmasses below 10^7 msun are either rare or are not as radio-loud as their moremassive counterparts. models that exclude bhs with masses below 10^7 msun arein agreement with the deepest existing radio observations, but still produce asignificant tail of high-redshift objects. in the 1-10ghz bands, at thesensitivity of 10 micro-jy, we find surface densities of 100, 10, and 0.3deg^-2 for sources located at z&gt;6, 10, and 15, respectively. the discovery ofthese sources with instruments such as the allen telescope array (ata),extended very large array (evla), and the square kilometer array (ska) wouldopen a new window for the study of supermassive bhs at high redshift. we alsofind surface densities of 0.1 deg^-2 at z &gt; 6 for mjy sources that can be usedto study 21 cm absorption from the epoch of reionization. we suggest that,although not yet optically identified, the first survey may have alreadydetected 10^3-10^4 such sources.

astro-ph;0408531	detection of 21 centimeter hi absorption at z = 0.78 in a survey of  radio continuum sources	we report the detection of a deep broad hi 21 cm absorption system at z =0.78 toward the radio source [hb89] 2351+456 (4c+45.51) at z = 1.992. the hiabsorption was identified in a blind spectral line survey conducted at thegreen bank telescope spanning 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 1.10 toward a large sample of radiocontinuum sources. the hi column density is n(hi) = 2.35 x 10^19 (t_s/f) cm^-2,where t_s is the spin temperature and f is the continuum covering factor of theabsorbing gas. for t_s/f &gt; 8.5 k, this system is by definition a damped lyalpha absorption system (n(hi) &gt;= 2 x 10^20 cm^-2). the line is unusuallybroad, with a fwhm of 53 km/s and a full span of 163 km/s, suggesting aphysically extended hi gas structure. radio surveys identify damped ly alphasystems in a manner that bypasses many of the selection effects present inoptical/uv surveys, including dust extinction and the atmospheric cutoff for z&lt; 1.65. the smooth broad profile of this hi 21 cm absorption system is similarto the z = 0.89 hi absorption toward pks 1830-211, which suggests that theabsorber toward [hb89] 2351+456 is also a gravitational lens and a molecularabsorption system. however, very long baseline interferometry and hubble spacetelescope observations show little evidence for gravitational lensing, and bimamillimeter observations show no hco+ (1-2) or hcn (1-2) absorption down to tau= 0.15 (3 sigma) in 5 km/s channels. although this radio damped ly alphaselection technique would include dusty, molecule-rich systems, [hb89] 2351+456appears to be a ``vanilla'' hi 21 cm absorber.

astro-ph;0507221	a radio transient 0.1 pc from sagittarius a*	we report the discovery of a transient radio source 2.7 arcsec (0.1 pcprojected distance) south of the galactic center massive black hole,sagittarius a*. the source flared with a peak of at least 80 mjy in march 2004.the source was resolved by the very large array into two components with aseparation of ~0.7 arcsec and characteristic sizes of ~0.2 arcsec. the twocomponents of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1 +/- 0.1. we detectan upper limit to the proper motion of the eastern component of ~3 x 10^3 kms^-1 relative to sgr a*. we detect a proper motion of ~10^4 km s^-1 for thewestern component relative to sgr a*. the transient was also detected at x-raywavelengths with the chandra x-ray observatory and the xmm-newton telescope andgiven the designation cxogc j174540.0-290031. the x-ray source falls in betweenthe two radio components. the maximum luminosity of the x-ray source is ~10^36erg s^-1, significantly sub-eddington. the radio jet flux density predicted bythe x-ray/radio correlation for x-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less thanthe measured flux density. we conclude that the radio transient is the resultof a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the x-ray sourceand interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the galactic center.

astro-ph;0601474	radio linear and circular polarization from m81*	we present results from archival very large array (vla) data and new vlaobservations to investigate the long term behavior of the circular polarizationof m81*, the nuclear radio source in the nearby galaxy m81. we also used theberkeley-illinois-maryland association (bima) array to observe m81* at 86 and230 ghz. m81* is unpolarized in the linear sense at a frequency as high as 86ghz and shows variable circular polarization at a frequency as high as 15 ghz.the spectrum of the fractional circular polarization is inverted in most of ourobservations. the sign of circular polarization is constant over frequency andtime. the absence of linear polarization sets a lower limit to the accretionrate of $10^{-7} m_\odot y^{-1}$. the polarization properties are strikinglysimilar to the properties of sgr a*, the central radio source in the milky way.this supports the hypothesis that m81* is a scaled up version of sgr a*. on theother hand, the broad band total intensity spectrum declines towards milimeterwavelengths which differs from previous observations of m81* and also from sgra*.

astro-ph;0606381	the rotation measure and 3.5mm polarization of sgr a*	we report the detection of variable linear polarization from sgr a* at awavelength of 3.5mm, the longest wavelength yet at which a detection has beenmade. the mean polarization is 2.1 +/- 0.1% at a position angle of 16 +/- 2 degwith rms scatters of 0.4% and 9 deg over the five epochs. we also detectpolarization variability on a timescale of days. combined with previousdetections over the range 150-400ghz (750-2000 microns), the averagepolarization position angles are all found to be consistent with a rotationmeasure of -4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10^5 rad/m^2. this implies that the faraday rotationoccurs external to the polarized source at all wavelengths. this implies anaccretion rate ~0.2 - 4 x 10^-8 msun/yr for the accretion density profilesexpected of adaf, jet and cdaf models and assuming that the region at whichelectrons in the accretion flow become relativistic is within 10 r_s. theinferred accretion rate is inconsistent with adaf/bondi accretion. thestability of the mean polarization position angle between disparatepolarization observations over the frequency range limits fluctuations in theaccretion rate to less than 5%. the flat frequency dependence of the inter-daypolarization position angle variations also makes them difficult to attributeto rotation measure fluctuations, and suggests that both the magnitude andposition angle variations are intrinsic to the emission.

0809.2442	event-horizon-scale structure in the supermassive black hole candidate  at the galactic centre	the cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes,which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accretingmatter into radiation (ref 1). sagittarius a*, the compact source of radio,infrared and x-ray emission at the centre of the milky way, is the closestexample of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4 milliontimes that of the sun (refs. 2,3). a long-standing astronomical goal is toresolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding sgr a* wherestrong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emittednear the black hole. radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5 mm and 7 mm havedetected intrinsic structure in sgr a*, but the spatial resolution ofobservations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering (refs.4-7). here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm that set a size of37 (+16, -10; 3-sigma) microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of sgr a*.this is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of thepresumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of sgra* emission may not be notcentred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.
