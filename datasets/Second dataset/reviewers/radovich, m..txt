0902.4230	pulsating variable stars in the coma berenices dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present b, v, i time-series photometry of the coma berenices dwarfspheroidal galaxy, a faint milky way satellite, recently discovered by thesloan digital sky survey. we have obtained v, b-v and v, v-i color-magnitudediagrams that reach v~23.0-23.2 mag showing the galaxy turnoff at v~21.7 mag,and have performed the first study of the variable star population of this newmilky way companion. two rr lyrae stars (a fundamental-mode -rrab- and a firstovertone -rrc- pulsator) and a short period variable with period p=0.12468 dayswere identified in the galaxy. the rrab star has a rather long period ofp_ab=0.66971 days and is about 0.2 mag brighter than the rrc variable and othernon-variable stars on the galaxy horizontal branch. in the period-amplitudediagram the rrab variable falls closer to the loci of oosterhoff type-iisystems and evolved fundamental-mode rr lyrae stars in the galactic globularcluster m3. the average apparent magnitude of the galaxy horizontal branch,&lt;v_hb&gt;=18.64+-0.04 mag, leads to a distance modulus for the coma dsphmu_0=18.13+-0.08 mag, corresponding to a distance d=42^{+2}_{-1} kpc, byadopting a reddening e(b-v) = 0.045 +- 0.015 mag and a metallicity [fe/h]=-2.53+- 0.05 dex.

0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0906.4035	wide and deep near-uv (360nm) galaxy counts and the extragalactic  background light with the large binocular camera	deep multicolour surveys are the main tool to explore the formation andevolution of the faint galaxies which are beyond the spectroscopic limit withthe present technology. the photometric properties of these faint galaxies areusually compared with current renditions of semianalytical models to provideconstraints on the fundamental physical processes involved in galaxy formationand evolution, namely the mass assembly and the star formation. galaxy countsover large sky areas in the near-uv band are important because they aredifficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-uv instrumentation, evenat 8m class telescopes. a large instrumental field of view helps in minimizingthe biases due to the cosmic variance. we have obtained deep images in the360nm u band provided by the blue channel of the large binocular camera at theprime focus of the large binocular telescope. we have derived over an area of~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to u=27 in the vega system(corresponding to u=27.86 in the ab system) at a completeness level of 30%reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. the shapeof the galaxy counts in the u band can be described by a double power-law, thebright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparableor greater areas. the slope bends over significantly at u&gt;23.5 ensuring theconvergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the ebl in thenear-uv band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limitsderived for this band. we have jointly compared our near-uv and k band countscollected from the literature with few selected hierarchical cdm modelsemphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formationand evolution.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

1002.1625	abell 611. ii. x-ray and strong lensing analyses	we present the results of our analyses of the x-ray emission and of thestrong lensing systems in the relaxed galaxy cluster abell 611 (z=0.288). weinfer the x-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles ofthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametricapproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adoptinga matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of abell611 via the x-ray data. we derive the total projected mass in the centralregion of abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensingfeatures through the publicly available analysis software lenstool. as a finalstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. we derive a goodagreement between the x-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in thecentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginaldisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating thestrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. we suggest that in this casethe x-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrectestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of thedark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different masscomponents in the strong lensing analysis. we discuss the effect of somepossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. we find a slightdependence of the measurements of the x-ray temperatures (and therefore of thex-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, withtotal deviations on the value of m_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statisticalerror. the strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to theparameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, inparticular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) baryoniccomponent.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

(abridged)  we obtained a final sample of 117 sne, most of which are snia (57%) and theremaining core collapse events of which 44% type ii, 22% type iin and 34% typeib/c. in order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxiesin the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a limiting magnitude k_ab=23.5 mag. wemeasured the sn rate per unit volume for sn ia and core collapse sne indifferent bin of redshifts. the values are consistent with other measurementsfrom the literature. the dispersion of the rate measurements for sne ia iscomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (sd) anddouble degenerate (dd) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allowto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. however, we maynotice that among the three tested models, sd and two flavours of dd, eitherwith a steep (ddc) or a wide (ddw) delay time distribution, the sd gives abetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the ddc better matches thesteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. the ddw appears instead less favoured. the corecollapse sn rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the predictionbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standardprogenitor mass range.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0101511	cosmic shear statistics and cosmology	we report a measurement of cosmic shear correlations using an effective areaof 6.5 sq. deg. of the virmos deep imaging survey in progress at thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. we measured various shear correlationfunctions, the aperture mass statistic and the top-hat smoothed variance of theshear with a detection significance exceeding 12 sigma for each of them. wepresent results on angular scales from 3 arc-seconds to half a degree. theconsistency of different statistical measures is demonstrated and confirms thelensing origin of the signal through tests that rely on the scalar nature ofthe gravitational potential. for cold dark matter models we find $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}=0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ at the 95% confidence level. themeasurement over almost three decades of scale allows to discuss the effect ofthe shape of the power spectrum on the cosmological parameter estimation. thedegeneracy on sigma_8-omega_0 can be broken if priors on the shape of thelinear power spectrum (that can be parameterized by gamma) are assumed. forinstance, with gamma=0.21 and at the 95% confidence level, we obtain0.6&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.1 and 0.2&lt;omega_0&lt;0.5 for open models, and sigma_8&gt;0.65 andomega_0&lt;0.4 for flat (lambda-cdm) models. from the tangential/radial modesdecomposition we can set an upper limit on the intrinsic shape alignment, whichwas recently suggested as a possible contribution to the lensing signal. withinthe error bars, there is no detection of intrinsic shape alignment for scaleslarger than 1'.

astro-ph;0601385	the environment of active galaxies in the sdss-dr4	we study the environment of active galaxies and compare it with that of starforming and normal galaxies. we extracted from the fourth data release (dr4) ofthe sloan digitaly sky survey (sdss) the galaxies in the redshift range 0.05\le z \le 0.095 and with m(r) \le -20.0 (that is m* + 1.45). emission lineratios and/or widths are used to separate active galactic nuclei (agn) fromstar-forming galaxies (sfgs); agn are classified as seyfert-1 and seyfert-2galaxies according to emission line widths. the environmental properties, asdefined by a density parameter and the number of companions, are compared forthe different types of galaxies, taking into account the morphological type ofthe host galaxies. we find no difference in the large-scale environment ofseyfert-1 and seyfert-2 galaxies; however, a larger fraction of seyfert-2 (~2%)than seyfert-1 (~1%) is found in systems which are smaller than r_{max} \le 100kpc, mainly in low-density environments (pairs or triplets); for comparison,this fraction is ~2% for star forming galaxies and ~1% for normal galaxies. wefind no evidence for a relation between large-scale environment properties andactivity. if activity and environment are related, this more likely occurs onsmall scales (e.g. galaxy interaction, merging).

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701799	weak lensing mass reconstruction of the galaxy cluster abell 209	weak lensing applied to deep optical images of clusters of galaxies providesa powerful tool to reconstruct the distribution of the gravitating massassociated to these structures. we use the shear signal extracted by ananalysis of deep exposures of a region centered around the galaxy cluster abell209, at redshift z=0.2, to derive both a map of the projected mass distributionand an estimate of the total mass within a characteristic radius. we use aseries of deep archival r-band images from cfht-12k, covering an area of 0.3deg^2. we determine the shear of background galaxy images using a newimplementation of the modified kaiser-squires-broadhurst pipeline for sheardetermination, which we has been tested against the ``shear testing program 1and 2'' simulations. we use mass aperture statistics to produce maps of the 2dimensional density distribution, and parametric fits using bothnavarro-frenk-white (nfw) and singular-isothermal-sphere profiles to constrainthe total mass. the projected mass distribution shows a pronounced asymmetry,with an elongated structure extending from the se to the nw. this is in generalagreement with the optical distribution previously found by other authors. asimilar elongation was previously detected in the x-ray emission map, and inthe distribution of galaxy colours. the circular nfw mass profile fit gives atotal mass of m_{200} = 7.7^{+4.3}_{-2.7} 10^{14} solar masses inside thevirial radius r_{200} = 1.8\pm 0.3 mpc. the weak lensing profile reinforces theevidence for an elongated structure of abell 209, as previously suggested bystudies of the galaxy distribution and velocities.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.
