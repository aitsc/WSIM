0908.4176	near-ir search for lensed supernovae behind galaxy clusters: i.  observations and transient detection efficiency	massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift can magnify the flux ofdistant background sources by several magnitudes and we exploit this effect tosearch for lensed distant supernovae that may otherwise be too faint to bedetected. a supernova search was conducted at near infrared wavelengths usingthe isaac instrument at the vlt. the galaxy clusters abell 1689, abell 1835 andac114 were observed at multiple epochs of 2 hours of exposure time, separatedby a month. image-subtraction techniques were used to search for transientobjects with light curve properties consistent with supernovae, both in our newand archival isaac/vlt data. the limiting magnitude of the individual epochswas estimated by adding artificial stars to the subtracted images. most of theepochs reach 90% detection efficiency at sz(j) ~= 23.8-24.0 mag (vega). twotransient objects, both in archival images of abell 1689 and ac114, weredetected. the transient in ac114 coincides - within the position uncertainty -with an x-ray source and is likely to be a variable agn at the clusterredshift. the transient in abell 1689 was found at sz=23.24 mag, ~0.5 arcsecaway from a galaxy with photometric redshift z=0.6 +/-0.15. the light curvesand the colors of the transient are consistent with a reddened type iipsupernova at redshift z=0.59 +/- 0.05. the lensing model of abell 1689 predicts~1.4 mag of magnification at the position of the transient, making it the mostmagnified supernova ever found and only the second supernova found behind agalaxy cluster. our pilot survey has demonstrated the feasibility to finddistant gravitationally magnified supernovae behind massive galaxy clusters.one likely supernova was found behind abell 1689, in accordance with theexpectations for this survey, as shown in an accompanying analysis paper.

0909.3527	the distribution of dark matter over 3 decades in radius in the lensing  cluster abell 611	we present a detailed analysis of the baryonic and dark matter distributionin the lensing cluster abell 611 (z=0.288), with the goal of determining thedark matter profile over an unprecedented range of cluster-centric distance. bycombining three complementary probes of the mass distribution, weak lensingfrom deep multi-color imaging, strong lensing constraints based on theidentification of multiply-imaged sources, and resolved stellar velocitydispersion measures for the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), we extend themethodology for separating the dark and baryonic mass components introduced bysand et al. (2008). our resulting dark matter profile samples the cluster from~3 kpc to 3.25 mpc, thereby providing an excellent basis for comparisons withrecent numerical models. we demonstrate that only by combining our threeobservational techniques can degeneracies in constraining the form of the darkmatter profile be broken on scales crucial for detailed comparisons withnumerical simulations. our analysis reveals that a simple navarro, frenk, andwhite (nfw) profile is an unacceptable fit to our data. we confirm earlierclaims that the inner profile of the dark matter profile deviates significantlyfrom the nfw form and find a inner logarithmic slope \beta flatter than 0.3(68%; where rho_dm ~ r^{-\beta} at small radii). in order to reconcile our datawith cluster formation in a lambdacdm cosmology, we speculate that it may benecessary to revise our understanding of the nature of baryon--dark matterinteractions in cluster cores. comprehensive weak and strong lensing data, whencoupled with kinematic information on the brightest cluster galaxy, can readilybe applied to a larger sample of clusters to test the universality of theseresults.

0910.4910	looking for the first galaxies: lensing or blank fields?	the identification and study of the first galaxies remains one of the mostexciting topics in observational cosmology. the determination of the bestpossible observing strategies is a very important choice in order to build up arepresentative sample of spectroscopically confirmed sources at high-z (z&gt;7),beyond the limits of present-day observations. this paper is intended toprecisely adress the relative efficiency of lensing and blank fields in theidentification and study of galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12. the detection efficiency andfield-to-field variance are estimated from direct simulations of both blank andlensing fields observations. the presence of a strong-lensing cluster along theline of sight has a dramatic effect on the number of observed sources, with apositive magnification bias in typical ground-based ``shallow'' surveys(ab&lt;~25.5). the positive magnification bias increases with the redshift ofsources and decreases with both depth of the survey and the size of thesurveyed area. the maximum efficiency is reached for lensing clusters atz~0.1-0.3. observing blank fields in shallow surveys is particularlyinefficient as compared to lensing fields if the uv lf for lbgs is stronglyevolving at z&gt;~7. also in this case, the number of z&gt;8 sources expected at thetypical depth of jwst (ab~28-29) is much higher in lensing than in blank fields(e.g. a factor of ~10 for ab&lt;~28). blank field surveys with a large field ofview are needed to prove the bright end of the lf at z&gt;6-7, whereas lensingclusters are particularly useful for exploring the mid to faint end of the lf.

1001.1943	a search for galaxies in and around an hi overdense region at z=5	we present the discovery of a large-scale structure of emission-line galaxiesat redshift z=4.86 behind a massive cluster of galaxies, a1689. previousspectroscopic observations of a galaxy, a1689-7.1 at z=4.87, near thisstructure, revealed a possible overdense region of inter-galactic medium (igm)around the galaxy, which extends at least ~80 comoving mpc along the line ofsight. in order to investigate whether this z~5 igm overdense region contains agalaxy overdensity, we undertook narrow- and broad-band imaging observationsaround a1689-7.1 with subaru/suprime-cam. we detected 51 candidate ly-alphaemitters at redshift z=4.86+-0.03 in the 32 x 24 arcmin^2 field of view. aftercorrection for lensing by the foreground cluster, we found a large-scale (~20 x60 comoving mpc) overdense region of galaxies around a1689-7.1 in the sourceplane at z=4.86. the densest peak in this region has an overdensity of delta~4,suggesting that this structure is probably a good candidate for a protocluster.a1689-7.1 is located at the edge of this region, where the local galaxy densityis ~1.6 times the mean density and is close to the density contrast in the igmalong the line of sight to a1689-7.1 estimated from the optical depth. theoverdensities of galaxies we have found may suggest that at least some parts ofthe igm overdense region have already started to form galaxies and moreoverthey relate to the formation of a protocluster. although we lack information onthe three dimensional distributions of both igm and galaxy overdense regions,the similarity of the scales of both regions may suggest that the two are partsof a single large-scale structure, which would be an large edge-on sheet alongthe line of sight with a size of ~20 x 60 x 80 comoving mpc.

1002.1625	abell 611. ii. x-ray and strong lensing analyses	we present the results of our analyses of the x-ray emission and of thestrong lensing systems in the relaxed galaxy cluster abell 611 (z=0.288). weinfer the x-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles ofthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametricapproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adoptinga matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of abell611 via the x-ray data. we derive the total projected mass in the centralregion of abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensingfeatures through the publicly available analysis software lenstool. as a finalstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. we derive a goodagreement between the x-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in thecentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginaldisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating thestrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. we suggest that in this casethe x-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrectestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of thedark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different masscomponents in the strong lensing analysis. we discuss the effect of somepossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. we find a slightdependence of the measurements of the x-ray temperatures (and therefore of thex-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, withtotal deviations on the value of m_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statisticalerror. the strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to theparameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, inparticular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) baryoniccomponent.

1005.1566	gravitational lensing and dynamics in sl2s\,j02140-0535: probing the  mass out to large radius	we aim to probe the mass of sl2s\,j02140-0535, a galaxy group at $z$ = 0.44from the strong lensing legacy survey (sl2s). we combine strong lensingmodeling and dynamical constraints. the strong lensing analysis is based onmulti-band hst/acs observations exhibiting strong lensing features that we havefollowed-up spectroscopically with vlt/fors2. to constrain the scale radius ofan nfw mass profile that cannot be constrained by strong lensing, we propose anew method by taking advantage of the large-scale dynamical informationprovided by vlt/fors2 and keck/lris spectroscopy of group members. in constrastto other authors, we show that the observed lensing features insl2s\,j02140-0535 belong to different background sources: one at $z$ = 1.7$\pm$ 0.1 produces three images, while the other at $z$ = 1.023 $\pm$ 0.001 hasonly a single image. our unimodal nfw mass model reproduces these images verywell. it is characterized by a concentration parameter $c_{200}$ = 6.0 $\pm$0.6, which is slightly greater than the value expected from $\lambda$cdmsimulations for a mass of m$_{200}$ $\approx$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ m$_{\sun}$.the spectroscopic analysis of group members also reveals a unimodal structurethat exhibits no evidence of merging. we compare our dynamic mass estimate withan independent weak-lensing based mass estimate finding that both areconsistent. our combined lensing and dynamical analysis of sl2s\,j02140-0535demonstrates the importance of spectroscopic information in reliablyidentifying the lensing features. our findings argue that the system is arelaxed, massive galaxy group where mass is traced by light. this work shows apotentially useful method for constraining large-scale properties inaccessibleto strong lensing, such as the scale radius of the nfw profile.

1005.1575	herschel deep far-infrared counts through the abell 2218 cluster-lens	gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows study of thepopulation of intrinsically faint infrared galaxies that lie below thesensitivity and confusion limits of current infrared and submillimetertelescopes. we present ultra-deep pacs 100 and 160 microns observations towardthe cluster lens abell 2218, to penetrate the herschel confusion limit. wederive source counts down to a flux density of 1 mjy at 100 microns and 2 mjyat 160 microns, aided by strong gravitational lensing. at these levels, sourcedensities are 20 and 10 beams/source in the two bands, approaching sourcedensity confusion at 160 microns. the slope of the counts below the turnover ofthe euclidean-normalized differential curve is constrained in both bands and isconsistent with most of the recent backwards evolutionary models. byintegrating number counts over the flux range accessed by abell 2218 lensing(0.94-35 mjy at 100 microns and 1.47-35 mjy at 160 microns, we retrieve acosmic infrared background (cib) surface brightness of ~8.0 and ~9.9 nw m^-2sr^-1, in the respective bands. these values correspond to 55% (+/- 24%) and77% (+/- 31%) of dirbe direct measurements. combining abell 2218 results withwider/shallower fields, these figures increase to 62% (+/- 25%) and 88% (+/-32%) cib total fractions, resolved at 100 and 160 microns, disregarding thehigh uncertainties of dirbe absolute values.

1201.2908	a bright z=5.2 lensed submillimeter galaxy in the field of abell 773:  hlsj091828.6+514223	during our herschel lensing survey (hls) of massive galaxy clusters, we havediscovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster abell 773,which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=5.2429.this source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered byherschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mjy at 500\micron)and its high redshift. the dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not thecluster itself. the source has a far-infrared (fir) luminosity of l_fir= 1.110^{14}/\mu lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. wereport here the redshift identification through co lines with the iram-30m, andthe analysis of the gas excitation, based on co(7-6), co(6-5), co(5-4) detectedat iram and the co(2-1) at the evla. all lines decompose into a wide and strongred component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ulirg) co-to-h2 conversion ratio, the h2mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu mo, of which one third is in a cool component. from theci line we derive a ci/h2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that inother ulirgs. the h2o line is strong only in the red velocity component, withan intensity ratio i(h_2o)/i(co) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local firradiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (agn) component. we detect the[nii]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. it shows comparable blue andred components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gasflows.

1202.1745	nebular and global properties of the gravitationally lensed galaxy "the  8 o'clock arc"	we present the analysis of new nir, intermediate-resolution spectra of thegravitationally lensed galaxy "the 8 o'clock arc" at z_sys = 2.7350 obtainedwith vlt/x-shooter. these rest-frame optical data, combined with hst andspitzer images, provide very valuable information, which nicely complement ourprevious detailed rest-frame uv spectral analysis. from high-resolution hstimages, we reconstruct the morphology of the arc in the source plane, andidentify that the source is formed of two majors parts, the main galaxycomponent and a smaller blob separated by 1.2 kpc in projected distance. theblob, with a twice larger magnification factor, is resolved in the spectra. themulti-gaussian fitting of detected nebular emission lines and the spectralenergy distribution modeling of the available multi-wavelength photometryprovide the census of gaseous and stellar dust extinctions, gas-phasemetallicities, star-formation rates (sfrs), and stellar, gas, and dynamicalmasses for both the main galaxy and the blob. as a result, the 8 o'clock arcshows a marginal trend for a more attenuated ionized gas than stars, andsupports a dependence of the dust properties on the sfr. with a high specificstar-formation rate, ssfr = 33+/-19 gyr^{-1}, this lensed lyman-break galaxydeviates from the mass-sfr relation, and is characterized by a young age of40^{+25}_{-20} myr and a high gas fraction of about 72%. the 8 o'clock arcsatisfies the fundamental mass, sfr, and metallicity relation, and favors thatit holds up beyond z~2.5. we believe that the blob, with a gas mass m_gas =(2.2+/-0.9)x10^{9} msun (one order of magnitude lower than the mass of thegalaxy), a half-light radius r1/2 = 0.53+/-0.05 kpc, a star-formation ratesfr_halpha = 33+/-19 msun yr^{-1}, and in rotation around the main core of thegalaxy, is one of these star-forming clumps commonly observed in z&gt;1star-forming galaxies.

1205.4187	the bright-end of the luminosity function at z~9	we report new constraints on the galaxy luminosity function at z~9 based onobservations carried out with eso/vlt fors2, hawk-i and x-shooter around thelensing cluster a2667, as part of our project aimed at selecting z~7-10candidates accessible to spectroscopy. only one j-dropout source was selectedin this field fulfilling the color and magnitude criteria. this source wasrecently confirmed as a mid-z interloper based on x-shooter spectroscopy. thedepth and the area covered by our survey are well suited to set strongconstraints on the bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function and hence onthe star formation history at very high redshift. the non-detection of reliablej-dropout sources over the ~36arcmin2 field of view towards a2667 was used tocarefully determine the lens-corrected effective volume and the correspondingupper-limit on the density of sources. the strongest limit is obtained forphi(m_{1500}=-21.4+/-0.50)&lt;6.70x10^{-6}mpc^{-3}mag^{-1} at z~9. amaximum-likelihood fit of the luminosity function using all available datapoints including the present new result yields m*&gt;-19.7 with fixed alpha=-1.74and phi*=1.10x10^{-3}mpc^{-3}. the corresponding star formation rate densityshould be rho_{sfr}&lt;5.97x10^{-3}m_{solar}/yr/mpc^{3} at z~9. these results arein good agreement with the most recent estimates already published in thisrange of redshift and for this luminosity domain. this new result confirms thedecrease in the density of luminous galaxies at very high-redshift, henceproviding strong constraints for the design of future surveys aiming to explorethe very high-redshift universe.

0711.1902	mid-infrared spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3: the nature of  sources near the mips confusion limit	we present spitzer/irs mid-infrared spectra for 15 gravitationally lensed, 24micron--selected galaxies, and combine the results with 4 additional very faintgalaxies with irs spectra in the literature. the median intrinsic 24 micronflux density of the sample is 130 microjy, enabling a systematic survey of thespectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate thenumber counts of spitzer cosmological surveys. six of the 19 galaxy spectra(32%) show the strong mid-ir continuua expected of agn; x-ray detectionsconfirm the presence of agn in three of these cases, and reveal agns in twoother galaxies. these results suggest that nuclear accretion may contributemore flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. almostall the spectra show some aromatic (pah) emission features; the measuredaromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. in particular, the highs/n mid-ir spectrum of smm j163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well withlow--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. we compare the rest-frame 8 micronand total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that thebehavior of this ratio with total ir luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2to z=0. since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxiesrule out a dominant contribution by agn, this finding implies systematicevolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources withredshift. it also has implications for the estimates of star forming ratesinferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a givenobserved frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometricluminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similarluminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.

1209.3805	the a2667 giant arc at z=1.03: evidence for large-scale shocks at high  redshift	we present the spatially resolved emission line ratio properties of a ~10^10m_sun star-forming galaxy at redshift z=1.03. this galaxy is gravitationallylensed as a triple-image giant arc behind the massive lensing cluster abell2667. the main image of the galaxy has magnification factors of 14+/-2.1 influx and ~ 2 by 7 in area, yielding an intrinsic spatial resolution of 115-405pc after ao correction with osiris at keck ii. the hst morphology shows aclumpy structure and the h\alpha\ kinematics indicates a large velocitydispersion with v_{max} sin(i)/\sigma ~ 0.73, consistent with high redshiftdisk galaxies of similar masses. from the [nii]/h\alpha\ line ratios, we findthat the central 350 parsec of the galaxy is dominated by star formation. the[nii]/h\alpha\ line ratios are higher in the outer-disk than in the centralregions. most noticeably, we find a blue-shifted region of strong[nii]/h\alpha\ emission in the outer disk. applying our recent hii region andslow-shock models, we propose that this elevated [nii]/h\alpha\ ratio region iscontaminated by a significant fraction of shock excitation due to galacticoutflows. our analysis suggests that shocked regions may mimic flat or invertedmetallicity gradients at high redshift.

1209.5741	hubble space telescope h-alpha imaging of star-forming galaxies at z =  1-1.5: evolution in the size and luminosity of giant hii regions	we present hst/wfc3 narrowband imaging of the h-alpha emission in a sample ofeight gravitationally-lensed galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5. the magnification causedby the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatialresolution of 360pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from~10x to ~50x. this enables us to identify resolved star-forming hii regions atthis epoch and therefore study their h-alpha luminosity distributions forcomparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local universe. we findevolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of hii regions withredshift. the distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an hiiregion luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponentialbreak at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. wetherefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because ofthe evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similarscaling relations to those at z = 0, but their hii regions are larger andbrighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.a simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the jeansmass in a marginally unstable disk shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-zgalaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causingperturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclicfrequencies which stabilise the disk.

1211.6423	the metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies from redshift 0 to 3:  combining magnitude limited survey with gravitational lensing	we present a comprehensive observational study of the gas phase metallicityof star-forming galaxies from z ~ 0 -&gt; 3. we combine our new sample ofgravitationally lensed galaxies with existing lensed and non-lensed samples toconduct a large investigation into the mass-metallicity (mz) relation at z &gt; 1.we apply a self-consistent metallicity calibration scheme to investigate themetallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift. thelensing magnification ensures that our sample spans an unprecedented range ofstellar mass (3*10^{7}-6*10^{10} m_sun). we find that at the median redshift ofz=2.07, the median metallicity of the lensed sample is 0.35 dex lower than thelocal sdss star-forming galaxies and 0.18 dex lower than the z ~ 0.8 deep2galaxies. we also present the z ~ 2 mz relation using 19 lensed galaxies. amore rapid evolution is seen between z ~ 1-&gt;3 than z ~ 0 -&gt; 1 for the high-massgalaxies (10^{9.5-11} m_sun), with almost twice as much enrichment between z ~1 -&gt; 3 than between z ~ 1 -&gt; 0. we compare this evolution with the most recentcosmological hydrodynamic simulations with momentum driven winds. we find thatthe model metallicity is consistent with the observed metallicity within theobservational error for the low mass bins. however, for higher masses, themodel over-predicts the metallicity at all redshifts. the over-prediction ismost significant in the highest mass bin of 10^{10-11} m_sun.

0802.4292	strong lensing in abell 1703: constraints on the slope of the inner dark  matter distribution	in this article, we apply strong lensing techniques in abell 1703, a massivex-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.28. our analysis is based on imaging databoth from space and ground in 8 bands, complemented with a spectroscopicsurvey. abell 1703 looks rather circular from the general shape of its multiplyimaged systems and present a dominant giant elliptical cd galaxy in its centre.this cluster exhibits a remarkable bright 'central ring' formed by 4 brightimages at z_{spec}=0.888 located very close to the cd galaxy, providingobservational constraints that are potentially very interesting to probe thecentral mass distribution. the stellar contribution from the cd galaxy (~1.2510^{12} m_{sun} within 7") is accounted for in our parametric mass modelling,and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described usinga generalized nfw profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope \alpha.we find that within the range where observational constraints are present (from~5" to ~50"), the slope of the dark matter distribution in abell1703 is equalto 1.09^{+0.05}_{-0.11} (3\sigma confidence level). the concentration parameteris equal to c_{200} ~ 3.5, and the scale radius is constrained to be largerthan the region where observational constraints are available. within thisradius, the 2d mass is equal to m(50")=2.4 10^{14} m_{\sun}. we cannot draw anyconclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results fromrealistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison.we advocate the need for a sample of observed and simulated unimodal relaxedgalaxy clusters in order to make reliable comparisons, and potentially providea test of cosmological models.

1405.1046	star formation in the massive cluster merger abell 2744	we present a comprehensive study of star-forming (sf) galaxies in the hstfrontier field recent cluster merger a2744 (z=0.308). wide-field,ultraviolet-infrared (uv-ir) imaging enables a direct constraint of the totalstar formation rate (sfr) for 53 cluster galaxies, with sfr{uv+ir}=343+/-10msun/yr. within the central 4 arcmin (1.1 mpc) radius, the integrated sfr iscomplete, yielding a total sfr{uv+ir}=201+/-9 msun/yr. focussing on obscuredstar formation, this core region exhibits a total sfr{ir}=138+/-8 msun/yr, amass-normalised sfr{ir} of sigma{sfr}=11.2+/-0.7 msun/yr per 10^14 msun and afraction of ir-detected sf galaxies f{sf}=0.080(+0.010,-0.037). overall, thecluster population at z~0.3 exhibits significant intrinsic scatter in irproperties (total sfr{ir}, tdust distribution) apparently unrelated to thedynamical state: a2744 is noticeably different to the merging bullet cluster,but similar to several relaxed clusters. however, in a2744 we identify a trailof sf sources including jellyfish galaxies with substantial unobscured sf dueto extreme stripping (sfr{uv}/sfr{ir} up to 3.3). the orientation of the trail,and of material stripped from constituent galaxies, indicates that the passingshock front of the cluster merger was the trigger. constraints on starformation from both ir and uv are crucial for understanding galaxy evolutionwithin the densest environments.

1502.03842	alma detection of [cii] 158 micron emission from a strongly lensed z=2  star-forming galaxy	our objectives are to determine the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) and of star-formation in typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.following up on our previous multi-wavelength observations with hst, spitzer,herschel, and the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi), we have studied astrongly lensed z=2.013 galaxy, the arc behind the galaxy cluster macsj0451+0006, with alma to measure the [cii] 158 micron emission line, one of themain coolants of the ism. [cii] emission from the southern part of this galaxyis detected at 10 $\sigma$. taking into account strong gravitational lensing,which provides a magnification of $\mu=49$, the intrinsic lensing-corrected[cii]158 micron luminosity is $l(cii)=1.2 \times 10^8 l_\odot$. the observedratio of [cii]-to-ir emission, $l(cii)/l(fir) \approx (1.2-2.4) \times10^{-3}$, is found to be similar to that in nearby galaxies. the same alsoholds for the observed ratio $l(cii)/l(co)=2.3 \times 10^3$, which iscomparable to that of star-forming galaxies and active galaxy nuclei (agn) atlow redshift. we utilize strong gravitational lensing to extend diagnosticstudies of the cold ism to an order of magnitude lower luminosity ($l(ir) \sim(1.1-1.3) \times 10^{11} l_\odot$) and sfr than previous work at high redshift.while larger samples are needed, our results provide evidence that the cold ismof typical high redshift galaxies has physical characteristics similar tonormal star forming galaxies in the local universe.

0812.1033	a new window of exploration in the mass spectrum: strong lensing by  galaxy groups in the sl2s	the existence of strong lensing systems with einstein radii (re) covering thefull mass spectrum, from ~1-2" (produced by galaxy scale dark matter haloes) to&gt;10" (produced by galaxy cluster scale haloes) have long been predicted. manylenses with re around 1-2" and above 10" have been reported but very few inbetween. in this article, we present a sample of 13 strong lensing systems withre in the range 3"- 8", i.e. systems produced by galaxy group scale dark matterhaloes, spanning a redshift range from 0.3 to 0.8. this opens a new window ofexploration in the mass spectrum, around 10^{13}- 10^{14} m_{sun}, which is acrucial range for understanding the transition between galaxies and galaxyclusters. our analysis is based on multi-colour cfhtls images complemented withhst imaging and ground based spectroscopy. large scale properties are derivedfrom both the light distribution of the elliptical galaxies group members andweak lensing of the faint background galaxy population. on small scales, thestrong lensing analysis yields einstein radii between 2.5" and 8". on largerscales, the strong lenses coincide with the peak of the light distribution,suggesting that mass is traced by light. most of the luminosity maps havecomplicated shapes, indicating that these intermediate mass structures aredynamically young. fitting the reduced shear with a singular isothermal sphere,we find sigma ~ 500 km/s and an upper limit of ~900 km/s for the whole sample.the mass to light ratio for the sample is found to be m/l_i ~ 250 (solar units,corrected for evolution), with an upper limit of 500. this can be compared tomass to light ratios of small groups (with sigma ~ 300 km/s and galaxy clusterswith sigma &gt; 1000 km/s, thus bridging the gap between these mass scales.
