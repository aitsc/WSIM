0905.3669	thermodynamic analysis of snowball earth hysteresis experiment:  efficiency, entropy production, and irreversibility	we present an extensive thermodynamic analysis of a hysteresis experimentperformed on a simplified yet earth-like climate model. we slowly vary thesolar constant by 20% around the present value and detect a substantialbistability: for a large range of values the realization of snowball (sb) or ofwarm (w) climate conditions depend on the history of the system. using recentresults on the global climate thermodynamics, we show that that the two regimesfeature radically different properties. the efficiency of the climate machineincreases with decreasing solar constant in w climate conditions, whereas theopposite takes place in the sb regime. instead, entropy production isincreasing with the solar constant in both branches of climate conditions, andits value is about 4 times as large in the w branch than in the corresponding cstate. finally, the degree of irreversibility of the system is much higher inthe w conditions, with an explosive growth in the upper range of the consideredvalues of solar constants. whereas in the sb regime a dominating role is playedby changes in the meridional albedo contrast, in the w climate regime changesin the intensity of latent heat fluxes are crucial for determining the observedproperties. this substantiates the importance of addressing correctly thevariations of the hydrological cycle in a changing climate. an interpretationof the transitions at the boundary of the bistable region based uponmacro-scale thermodynamic properties is also proposed. our results support theadoption of a new generation of diagnostic tools based on the 2nd law ofthermodynamics for auditing climate model and outline a set ofparameterizations to be used in conceptual and intermediate complexity modelsor for the reconstruction of the past climate conditions.

1110.0176	universal behavior of extreme value statistics for selected observables  of dynamical systems	the main results of the extreme value theory developed for the investigationof the observables of dynamical systems rely, up to now, on the gnedenkoapproach. in this framework, extremes are basically identified with the blockmaxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitelylong blocks. it has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions forthe underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class ofobservables are distributed according to the so called generalized extremevalue (gev) distribution. direct calculations show that in the case ofquasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to thegev distribution. in this paper we show that, in order to obtain a universalbehaviour of the extremes, the requirement of a mixing dynamics can be relaxedif the pareto approach is used, based upon considering the exceedances over agiven threshold. requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with awell defined exponent - the local dimension -, we show that the limitingdistribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with thegnedenko approach is a generalized pareto distribution where the parametersdepends only on the local dimensions and the value of the threshold. thisresult allows to extend the extreme value theory for dynamical systems to thecase of regular motions. we also provide connections with the results obtainedwith the gnedenko approach. in order to provide further support to ourfindings, we present the results of numerical experiments carried outconsidering the well-known chirikov standard map.

1110.6113	disentangling multi-level systems: averaging, correlations and memory	we consider two weakly coupled systems and adopt a perturbative approachbased on the ruelle response theory to study their interaction. we propose asystematic way to parametrize the effect of the coupling as a function of onlythe variables of a system of interest. our focus is on describing the impactsof the coupling on the long-term statistics rather than on the finite-timebehaviour. by direct calculation, we find that, at first order, the couplingcan be surrogated by adding a deterministic perturbation to the autonomousdynamics of the system of interest. at second order, there are additionally twoseparate and very different contributions. one is a term taking into accountthe second order contributions of the fluctuations in the coupling, which canbe parametrized as a stochastic forcing with given spectral properties. theother one is a memory term, coupling the system of interest to its previoushistory, through the correlations of the second system. if these correlationsare known, this effect can be implemented as a perturbation with memory on thesingle system. in order to treat this case, we present an extension to ruelle'sresponse theory able to deal with integral operators. we discuss our results inthe context of other methods previously proposed to disentangle the dynamics oftwo coupled systems. we emphasize that our results do not rely on assuming atime scale separation, and, if such a separation exist, can be used equallywell to study the statistics of the slow as well as that of the fast variables.by recursively applying the technique proposed here, we can treat the generalcase of multilevel systems.

1202.1073	beyond the linear fluctuation-dissipation theorem: the role of causality	in this paper we re-examine the traditional problem of connecting theinternal fluctuations of a system to its response to external forcings andextend the classical theory in order to be able to encompass also nonlinearprocesses. with this goal, we try to join on the results by kubo on statisticalmechanical systems close to equilibrium, i.e. whose unperturbed state can bedescribed by a canonical ensemble, the theory of dispersion relations, and theresponse theory recently developed by ruelle for non-equilibrium systemsequipped with an invariant srb measure. our derivations highlight the stronglink between causality and the possibility of connecting unambiguouslyfluctuation and response, both at linear and nonlinear level. we first show ina rather general setting how the formalism of the ruelle response theory can beused to derive in a novel way kramers-kronig relations connecting the real andimaginary part of the linear and nonlinear response to external perturbations.we then provide a formal extension at each order of nonlinearity of thefluctuation-dissipation theorem (fdt) for general systems possessing a smoothinvariant measure. finally, we focus on the physically relevant case of systemsclose to equilibrium, for which we present explicit fluctuation-dissipationrelations linking the susceptibility describing the $n^{th}$ order response ofthe system with the expectation value of suitably defined correlations of $n+1$observables taken in the equilibrium ensemble. while the fdt has an especiallycompact structure in the linear case, in the nonlinear case joining thestatistical properties of the fluctuations of the system to its response toexternal perturbations requires linear changes of variables, simple algebraicsums and multiplications, and a multiple convolution integral. theseoperations, albeit cumbersome, can be easily implemented numerically.

1207.1254	bistability of the climate around the habitable zone: a thermodynamic  investigation	the goal of this paper is to explore the potential multistability of theclimate of a planet around the habitable zone. a thorough investigation of thethermodynamics of the climate system is performed for very diverse conditionsof energy input and infrared atmosphere opacity. using plasim, an earth-likegeneral circulation model, the solar constant s* is modulated between 1160 and1510 wm-2 and the co2 concentration, [co2], from 90 to 2880 ppm. it is observedthat in such a parameter range the climate is bistable, i.e. there are twocoexisting attractors, one characterised by warm, moist climates (w) and one bycompletely frozen sea surface (snowball earth, sb). linear relationships arefound for the two transition lines (w\rightarrowsb and sb\rightarroww) in(s*,[co2]) between s* and the logarithm of [co2]. the dynamical andthermodynamical properties - energy fluxes, lorenz energy cycle, carnotefficiency, material entropy production - of the w and sb states are verydifferent: w states are dominated by the hydrological cycle and latent heat isprominent in the material entropy production; the sb states are predominantlydry climates where heat transport is realized through sensible heat fluxes andentropy mostly generated by dissipation of kinetic energy. we also show thatthe carnot efficiency regularly increases towards each transition between w andsb, with a large decrease in each transition. finally, we propose well-definedempirical functions allowing for expressing the global non-equilibriumthermodynamical properties of the system in terms of either the mean surfacetemperature or the mean planetary emission temperature. this paves the way forthe possibility of proposing efficient parametrisations of complexnon-equilibrium properties and of practically deducing fundamental propertiesof a planetary system from a relatively simple observable.

1208.5582	extreme value statistics for dynamical systems with noise	we study the distribution of maxima (extreme value statistics) for sequencesof observables computed along orbits generated by random transformations. theunderlying, deterministic, dynamical system can be regular or chaotic. in theformer case, we will show that by perturbing rational or irrational rotationswith additive noise, an extreme value law appears, regardless of the intensityof the noise, while unperturbed rotations do not admit such limitingdistributions. in the case of deterministic chaotic dynamics, we will considerobservables specially designed to study the recurrence properties in theneighbourhood of periodic points. hence, the exponential limiting law for thedistribution of maxima is modified by the presence of the extremal index, apositive parameter not larger than one, whose inverse gives the average size ofthe clusters of extreme events. the theory predicts that such a parameter isunitary when the system is perturbed randomly. we perform sophisticatednumerical tests to assess how strong is the impact of noise level, when finitetime series are considered. we find agreement with the asymptotic theoreticalresults but also non-trivial behaviour in the finite range. in particular ourresults suggest that in many applications where finite datasets can be producedor analysed one must be careful in assuming that the smoothing nature of noiseprevails over the underlying deterministic dynamics.

1211.0510	on using extreme values to detect global stability thresholds in  multi-stable systems: the case of transitional plane couette flow	extreme value theory (evt) is exploited to determine the global stabilitythreshold $r_g$ of plane couette flow --the flow of a viscous fluid in thespace between two parallel plates-- whose laminar or turbulent behavior dependson the reynolds number r. even if the existence of a global stability thresholdhas been detected in simulations and experiments, its numerical value has notbeen unequivocally defined. $r_g$ is the value such that for $r &gt; r_g$turbulence is sustained, whereas for $r &lt; r_g$ it is transient and eventuallydecays. we address the problem of determining $r_g$ by using the extremes -maxima and minima - of the perturbation energy fluctuations. when $r_g$, boththe positive and negative extremes are bounded. as the critical reynolds numberis approached from above, the probability of observing a very low minimumincreases causing asymmetries in the distributions of maxima and minima. on theother hand, the maxima distribution is unaffected as the fluctuations towardshigher values of the perturbation energy remain bounded. this tipping point canbe detected by fitting the data to the generalized extreme value (gev)distribution and by identifying $r_g$ as the value of $r$ such that the shapeparameter of the gev for the minima changes sign from negative to positive. theresults are supported by the analysis of theoretical models which feature abistable behavior.

1301.0733	towards a general theory of extremes for observables of chaotic  dynamical systems	in this paper we provide a connection between the geometrical properties of achaotic dynamical system and the distribution of extreme values. we show thatthe extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to theclassical generalised pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions forthe scaling and the shape parameter. in particular, we derive that the shapeparameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partialdimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutralmanifolds. the shape parameter is negative and is close to zero whenhigh-dimensional systems are considered. this result agrees with what wasderived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. combining theresults obtained using such physical observables and the properties of theextremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of thepartial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstabledirections of the flow. moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms ofmoments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linearresponse theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shapeparameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and ofthe kaplan-yorke dimension of the attractor. preliminary numericalinvestigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theorypresented here. the results presented here do not apply for all combinations ofaxiom a systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to veryspecial geometrical configurations.

1304.3945	entropy production and coarse graining of the climate fields in a  general circulation model	we extend the analysis of the thermodynamics of the climate system byinvestigating the role played by processes taking place at various spatial andtemporal scales through a procedure of coarse graining. the coarser is thegraining of the climatic fields, the lower is the resulting estimate of thematerial entropy production. in other terms, all the spatial and temporalscales of variability of the thermodynamic fields provide a positivecontribution to the material entropy production. at all scales, the temperaturefields and the heating fields resulting from the convergence of turbulentfluxes have a negative correlation, while the opposite holds between thetemperature fields and the radiative heating fields. moreover, the lattercorrelations are stronger, which confirms that radiation acts as primary driverfor the climatic processes, while the material fluxes dampen the resultingfluctuations through dissipative processes. using specific coarse-grainingprocedures, one can separate the various contributions to the material entropyproduction coming from the dissipation of kinetic energy, the vertical sensibleand latent heat fluxes, and the large scale horizontal fluxes. most of theentropy production is associated to irreversible exchanges occurring along thevertical direction, and neglecting the horizontal and time variability of thefields has a small impact on the estimate of the material entropy production.the approach presented here seems promising for testing climate models, forassessing the impact of changing their parametrizations and their resolution,and for investigating the atmosphere of exoplanets. our findings deserve to beexplored in a more general context, because they provide a way forunderstanding the relationship between forced fluctuations and dissipativeprocesses in continuum systems.

1502.01008	seasonal cycle of precipitation over major river basins in south and  southeast asia: a review of the cmip5 climate models data for present climate  and future climate projections	we review the skill of thirty coupled climate models participating in coupledmodel intercomparison project 5 in terms of reproducing properties of theseasonal cycle of precipitation over the major river basins of south andsoutheast asia (indus, ganges, brahmaputra and mekong) for historical period(1961-2000). we also present projected changes by these models by end ofcentury (2061-2100) under extreme scenario rcp8.5. first, we assess theirability to reproduce observed timings of the monsoon onset and the rate ofrapid fractional accumulation (rfa slope) - a measure of seasonality withinactive monsoon period. secondly, we apply a threshold-independent seasonalityindex (si) - a multiplicative measure of precipitation and extent of itsconcentration relative to the uniform distribution (relative entropy - re). weapply si distinctly for monsoonal precipitation regime (mpr), westerlyprecipitation regime (wpr) and annual precipitation regime. for presentclimate, neither any single model nor the multi-model mean performs best in allchosen metrics. models show overall a modest skill in suggesting right timingsof the monsoon onset while the rfa slope is generally underestimated. one thirdof models fail to capture the monsoon signal over the indus basin. mostly, siestimates for wpr are simulated higher than observed for all basins, while formpr, it is simulated higher (lower) for ganges and brahmaputra (indus andmekong) basins, following the pattern of overestimation (underestimation) ofprecipitation. however, models are biased positive (negative) for re estimatesover indus and ganges (brahmaputra and mekong) basins, implying the extent ofprecipitation concentration for mpr and number of dry days within wpr higher(lower) than observed for these basins. under the rcp8.5 scenario, most ofmodels project a slightly delayed monsoon onset, and a general increase in therfa slope...

1503.06708	prevailing climatic trends and runoff response from  hindukush-karakoram-himalaya, upper indus basin	we analyze trends in maximum, minimum and mean temperatures (tx, tn, andtavg, respectively), diurnal temperature range (dtr) and precipitation from 18stations (1250-4500 m asl) for their overlapping period of record (1995-2012),and separately, from six stations of their long term record (1961-2012). weapply mann-kendall test on serially independent time series to assess existenceof a trend while true slope is estimated using sen s slope method. further, westatistically assess the spatial scale (field) significance of local climatictrends within ten identified sub-regions of uib and analyze whether thespatially significant (field significant) climatic trends qualitatively agreewith a trend in discharge out of corresponding sub-region. over the recentperiod (1995-2012), we find a well agreed and mostly field significant cooling(warming) during monsoon season i.e. july-october (march-may and november),which is higher in magnitude relative to long term trends (1961-2012). we alsofind ... the observed hydroclimatic trends, being driven by certain changes inthe monsoonal system and westerly disturbances, indicate dominance(suppression) of nival (glacial) runoff regime, altering substantially theoverall hydrology of uib in future. these findings largely contribute toaddress the hydroclimatic explanation of the karakoram anomaly.

1506.07065	response operators for markov processes in a finite state space: radius  of convergence and link to the response theory for axiom a systems	using straightforward linear algebra we derive response operators describingthe impact of small perturbations to finite state markov processes. the resultscan be used for studying empirically constructed - e.g. from observations orthrough coarse graining of model simulations - finite state approximation ofstatistical mechanical systems. recent results concerning the convergence ofthe statistical properties of finite state markov approximation of the fullasymptotic dynamics on the srb measure in the limit of finer and finerpartitions of the phase space are suggestive of some degree of robustness ofthe obtained results in the case of axiom a system. our findings give closedformulas for the linear and nonlinear response theory at all orders ofperturbation and provide matrix expressions that can be directly implemented inany coding language, plus providing bounds on the radius of convergence of theperturbative theory. in particular, we relate the convergence of the responsetheory to the rate of mixing of the unperturbed system. one can use theformulas obtained for finite state markov processes to recover previousfindings obtained on the response of continuous time axiom a dynamical systemsto perturbations, by considering the generator of time evolution for themeasure and for the observables. a very basic, low-tech, and computationallycheap analysis of the response of the lorenz '63 model to perturbationsprovides rather encouraging results regarding the possibility of using theapproximate representation given by finite state markov processes to computethe system's response.

0805.2705	three-dimensional random voronoi tessellations: from cubic crystal  lattices to poisson point processes	we perturb the sc, bcc, and fcc crystal structures with a spatial gaussiannoise whose adimensional strength is controlled by the parameter a, and analyzethe topological and metrical properties of the resulting voronoi tessellations(vt). the topological properties of the vt of the sc and fcc crystals areunstable with respect to the introduction of noise, because the correspondingpolyhedra are geometrically degenerate, whereas the tessellation of the bcccrystal is topologically stable even against noise of small but finiteintensity. for weak noise, the mean area of the perturbed bcc and fcc crystalsvt increases quadratically with a. in the case of perturbed scc crystals, thereis an optimal amount of noise that minimizes the mean area of the cells.already for a moderate noise (a&gt;0.5), the properties of the three perturbed vtare indistinguishable, and for intense noise (a&gt;2), results converge to thepoisson-vt limit. notably, 2-parameter gamma distributions are an excellentmodel for the empirical of of all considered properties. the vt of theperturbed bcc and fcc structures are local maxima for the isoperimetricquotient, which measures the degre of sphericity of the cells, among spacefilling vt. in the bcc case, this suggests a weaker form of the recentluydisproved kelvin conjecture. due to the fluctuations of the shape of the cells,anomalous scalings with exponents &gt;3/2 is observed between the area and thevolumes of the cells, and, except for the fcc case, also for a-&gt;0. in thepoisson-vt limit, the exponent is about 1.67. as the number of faces ispositively correlated with the sphericity of the cells, the anomalous scalingis heavily reduced when we perform powerlaw fits separately on cells with aspecific number of faces.

1507.02228	crisis of the chaotic attractor of a climate model: a transfer operator  approach	the destruction of a chaotic attractor leading to a rough change in thedynamics of a system as a control parameter is smoothly varied is studied.while bifurcations involving non-chaotic invariant sets, such as fixed pointsor periodic orbits, can be characterised by a lyapunov exponent crossing theimaginary axis, little is known about the changes in a chaotic attractor duringa crisis.  the statistical physics framework, is particularly well suited for the studyof global properties of chaotic systems. in particular, the semigroup oftransfer operators governing the finite time evolution of probabilitydistributions in phase space and its spectrum characterises both the relaxationrate of distributions to a statistical steady-state and the stability of thissteady-state to perturbations. if critical slowing down indeed occurs in theapproach to an attractor crisis, the gap in the spectrum (between the leadingeigenvalue and the secondary ones) of the semigroup is expected to shrink.  here we use a high-dimensional, chaotic climate model system in which atransition from today's warm climate state to a snow-covered state occurs. thistransition is associated with the destruction of a chaotic attractor as thesolar constant is decreased. we show that critical slowing down develops inthis model before the destruction of the chaotic attractor and that it can beobserved from trajectories along the attractor. in addition, we demonstratethat the critical slowing down can be traced back to the shrinkage of theleading eigenvalues of coarse-grained approximations of the transfer operatorsand that these eigenvalues capture the fundamental features of the attractorcrisis.

1510.08682	stochastic parameterization: towards a new view of weather and climate  models	the last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations inshort-term, medium-range and seasonal ensembles: operational weather centersnow routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to better represent modelinadequacy and improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. developedinitially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochasticparameterizations not only provides more skillful estimates of uncertainty, butis also extremely promising for reducing longstanding climate biases andrelevant for determining the climate response to forcings such as e.g., anincrease of co2. this article highlights recent results from different researchgroups which show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes inthe atmosphere, oceans, land surface and cryosphere of comprehensive weatherand climate models a) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts ofweather and climate and b) reduces systematic model bias. we make a case thatthe use of mathematically stringent methods for derivation of stochasticdynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability toaccurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. recent work inmathematics, statistical mechanics and turbulence is reviewed and its relevancefor the climate problem demonstrated as well as future research directionsoutlined.

0809.0101	evidence of dispersion relations for the nonlinear response of the  lorenz 63 system	along the lines of the nonlinear response theory developed by ruelle, in aprevious paper we have proved under rather general conditions thatkramers-kronig dispersion relations and sum rules apply for a class ofsusceptibilities describing at any order of perturbation the response of axioma non equilibrium steady state systems to weak monochromatic forcings. wepresent here the first evidence of the validity of these integral relations forthe linear and the second harmonic response for the perturbed lorenz 63 system,by showing that numerical simulations agree up to high degree of accuracy withthe theoretical predictions. some new theoretical results, showing how toobtain recursively harmonic generation susceptibilities for generalobservables, are also presented. our findings confirm the conceptual validityof the nonlinear response theory, suggest that the theory can be extended formore general non equilibrium steady state systems, and shed new light on theapplicability of very general tools, based only upon the principle ofcausality, for diagnosing the behavior of perturbed chaotic systems andreconstructing their output signals, in situations where thefluctuation-dissipation relation is not of great help.

0811.4384	symmetry-break, mixing, instability, and low frequency variability in a  minimal lorenz-like system	starting from the classical saltzman 2d convection equations, we derive via asevere spectral truncation a minimal 10 ode system which includes the thermaleffect of viscous dissipation. neglecting this process leads to a dynamicalsystem which includes a decoupled (generalized) lorenz system. theconsideration of this process breaks an important symmetry, couples thedynamics of fast and slow variables, ensuing modifications of the structuralproperties of the attractor and of the spectral features. when the relevantnondimensional number (eckert number ec) is different from zero, the system isergodic and hyperbolic, the slow variables feature long term memory with 1/f3/2 power spectra, and the fast variables feature amplitude modulation on timescale of 1/ec. increasing the strength of the thermal-viscous feedback has astabilizing effect, as both the metric entropy and the kaplan-yorke attractordimension decrease monotonically with ec. the analyzed system features veryrich dynamics: it overcomes some of the limitations of the lorenz system andmight have prototypical value in relevant processes in complex systemsdynamics, such as the interaction between slow and fast variables. the presenceof long term memory and the associated extreme value statistics. analysis showshow, neglecting the coupling of slow and fast variables only on the basis ofscale analysis can be catastrophic. in fact, this leads to spurious invariancesthat affect essential dynamical properties (ergodicity, hyperbolicity) and thatcause the model losing ability in describing intrinsically multiscaleprocesses.
