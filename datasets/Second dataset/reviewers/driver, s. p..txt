0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1208.4293	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): in search of milky-way magellanic cloud  analogues	analysing all galaxy and mass assembly (gama) galaxies within a factor two(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the milky way (mw), there is a 11.9%chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within aprojected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is atleast as massive as the large magellanic cloud (lmc). two close companions atleast as massive as the small magellanic cloud (smc) are rare at the 3.4%level. two full analogues to the mw- lmc-smc system were found in gama (allgalaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of closetogether, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of mw massgalaxies (in the range where we could observe both the lmc and smc) have such asystem. in summary, the mw-lmc-smc system is a 2.7? event (when recast intogaussian statistics).  using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference forsmc- lmc binary pair analogues to be located within 2 mpc of a range ofdifferent lumi- nosity groups. there is a particular preference is for suchbinaries to be located near lg luminosity systems. when these groups aresubdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, thebinaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gapsystems. these systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer thesame amount of gravitational dark matter. this suggests that binaries such asthe smc-lmc might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorousmerger events. details of a particularly striking analogue to the mw-smc-lmcand m31 complex are included.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.5752	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): witnessing the assembly of the cluster  abell 1882	we present a combined optical and x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abell1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding therecent assembly history of this system. our optical data consist of spectradrawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, which lends itself tothis kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopiccompleteness. we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detectand characterize substructure. we complement the optical data with x-ray datataken with both chandra and xmm. our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors twomain components, a1882a and a1882b, which have a projected separation of 2mpcand a line of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. the primarysystem, a1882a, has velocity dispersion sigma_v=500km/s and chandra (xmm)temperature kt=3.57kev (3.31kev) while the secondary, a1882b, hassigma_v=457km/s and chandra (xmm) temperature kt=2.39kev (2.12kev). the opticaland x-ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within theuncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a(m_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}msolar) when compared with a1882b(m_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}msolar). we interpret the a1882a/a1882b system as beingobserved prior to a core passage. supporting this interpretation is the largeprojected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for arecent (&lt;2gyr) major interaction in the x-ray data. two-body analyses indicatethat a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutionsstrongly favored. we compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for thespectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers ofa1882a and a1882b, respectively. these blue fractions do not differsignificantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusterswith similar mass and redshift.

1401.0837	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mid-infrared properties and empirical  relations from $wise$	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalogthat, when combined with the wide-field infrared explorer ($wise$), allows usto explore for the first time the mid-infrared properties of $&gt; 110, 000$galaxies over 120 deg$^2$ to $z\simeq 0.5$. in this paper we detail theprocedure for producing the matched gama-$wise$ catalog for the g12 and g15fields, in particular characterising and measuring resolved sources; thecomplete catalogs for all three gama equatorial fields will be made availablethrough the gama public releases. the wealth of multiwavelength photometry andoptical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between opticallydetermined stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and3.4micron and 4.6micron wise measurements. similarly dust-correctedhalpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12micron and 22micronluminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to$z&lt;0.5$. to illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micronstar formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific starformation within the gama-wise sample and underscore the ability of wise todetect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. within galaxy groups (determined bya sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies witha neighbor within 100$\,h^{-1} $kpc have, on average, lower specific starformation rates than typical gama galaxies with the same stellar mass.

1401.0986	herschel-atlas/gama:how does the far-ir luminosity function depend on  galaxy group properties?	we use the herschel atlas (h-atlas) phase i data to study the conditionalluminosity function of far-ir (250 um) selected galaxies in optically-selectedgalaxy groups from the gama spectroscopic survey, as well as environmentaleffects on the far-ir-to-optical colour. we applied two methods, which gaveconsistent results for the far-ir conditional luminosity functions. the directmatching method matches h-atlas sources to gama/sdss galaxies, then links theoptical counterparts to gama groups. the stacking method counts the number offar-ir sources within the projected radii of gama groups, subtracting the localbackground. we investigated the dependence of the far-ir (250 um) luminosityfunction on group mass in the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt; 10d14msun/h and on redshiftin the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, using a sample of 3000 groups containing h-atlassources with gama redshifts over an area of 126 sq. deg. we find that thecharacteristic 250 um luminosity, l^*(250), increases with group mass up to m_h~ 10d13msun/h, but is roughly constant above this, while it increases withredshift at high group masses, but less so at low masses. we also find that thegroup far-ir luminosity-to-mass ratio l(250)/m_h increases with redshift and ishigher in low-mass groups. we estimate that around 70% of the 250 um luminositydensity in the local universe is contributed by groups with m_h &gt; 10d12msun/h.we also find that the far-ir-to-optical colours of h-atlas galaxies areindependent of group mass over the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt;10d14msun/h in the localuniverse. we also compare our observational results with recent semi-analyticalmodels, and find that none of these galaxy formation model can reproduce theconditional far-ir luminosity functions of galaxy groups.

1402.5654	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the evolution of bias in the radio  source population to z ~ 1.5	we present a large-scale clustering analysis of radio galaxies in the verylarge array (vla) faint images of the radio sky at twenty-cm (first) surveyover the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey area, limited to s1.4 ghz &gt;1mjy with spectroscopic and photometric redshift limits up to r &lt; 19.8 and r &lt;22 mag, respectively. for the gama spectroscopic matches, we present theredshift-space and projected correlation functions, the latter of whichyielding a correlation length r0 ~ 8.2 mpc/h and linear bias of ~1.9 at z ~0.34. furthermore, we use the angular two-point correlation functionw({\theta}) to determine spatial clustering properties at higher redshifts. wefind r0 to increase from ~6 to ~14 mpc/h between z = 0.3 and z = 1.55, with thecorresponding bias increasing from ~2 to ~10 over the same range. our resultsare consistent with the bias prescription implemented in the skads simulationsat low redshift, but exceed these predictions at z &gt; 1. this is indicative ofan increasing (rather than fixed) halo mass and/or agn fraction at higherredshifts or a larger typical halo mass for the more abundant fri sources.

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

1407.6068	the sami galaxy survey: early data release	we present the early data release of the sydney-aao multi-object integralfield spectrograph (sami) galaxy survey. the sami galaxy survey is an ongoingintegral field spectroscopic survey of ~3400 low-redshift (z&lt;0.12) galaxies,covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters.  in the early data release, we publicly release the fully calibrated datacubesfor a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the gama regions,along with information about these galaxies from the gama catalogues. alldatacubes for the early data release galaxies can be downloaded individually oras a set from the sami galaxy survey website.  in this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce thesami data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages inprocessing the raw data into calibrated datacubes. the pipeline gives excellentresults throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent(systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersionremoved with an accuracy of 0."09, less than a fifth of a spaxel.

1408.1476	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy close-pairs, mergers, and the  future fate of stellar mass	we use a highly complete subset of the gama-ii redshift sample to fullydescribe the stellar mass dependence of close-pairs and mergers between 10^8msun and 10^12 msun. using the analytic form of this fit we investigate thetotal stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios.depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, thefraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0%-5.6%. using thegama-ii data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pairfraction between redshift $z = 0.05-0.2$. however, we find a systematicallyhigher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to publishedresults over a similar redshift baseline. using a compendium of data and thefunction $\gamma_m =a(1+z)m$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we findfitting parameters of $a = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, whichrepresents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slopethan recent literature values. we find that the relative importance of in-situstar-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, withstar-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below mstar andmerger accretion events dominating beyond mstar. we find mergers have ameasurable impact on the whole extent of the gsmf, manifest as a deepening ofthe dip in the gsmf over the next gyr and an increase in mstar by as much as0.01-0.05 dex.

1411.2557	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): bivariate functions of h$\alpha$ star  forming galaxies	we present bivariate luminosity and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$ starforming galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. whileoptically deep spectroscopic observations of gama over a wide sky area enablethe detection of a large number of $0.001&lt;{sfr}_{h\alpha}$ (m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$)$&lt;100$ galaxies, the requirement for an h$\alpha$ detection intargets selected from an $r$-band magnitude limited survey leads to anincompleteness due to missing optically faint star forming galaxies. using$z&lt;0.1$ bivariate distributions as a reference we model the higher-$z$distributions, thereby approximating a correction for the missing opticallyfaint star forming galaxies to the local sfr and stellar mass densities.furthermore, we obtain the $r$-band lfs and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$star forming galaxies from the bivariate lfs. as our sample is selected on thebasis of detected h$\alpha$ emission, a direct tracer of on-going starformation, this sample represents a true star forming galaxy sample, and isdrawn from both photometrically classified blue and red sub-populations, thoughmostly from the blue population. on average 20-30% of red galaxies at allstellar masses are star forming, implying that these galaxies may be dusty starforming systems.

1412.2141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy luminosity function within  the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on geometricenvironment within the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. the tidal tensorprescription, based on the hessian of the pseudo-gravitational potential, isused to classify the cosmic web and define the geometric environments: for agiven smoothing scale, we classify every position of the surveyed region,$0.04&lt;{z}&lt;0.26$, as either a void, a sheet, a filament or a knot. we considerhow to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the hessian in orderto partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. we find asignificant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between differentgeometric environments; the normalisation, characterised by $\phi^{*}$ in aschechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots.the turnover magnitude, characterised by $m^*$, brightens by approximately$0.5$ mag from voids to knots. however, we show that the observed modulationcan be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. wetherefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on thegalaxy luminosity function.

0804.2892	on the galaxy stellar mass function, the mass-metallicity relation, and  the implied baryonic mass function	a comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs)shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4--8 per cent of thebaryon density (assuming omega_b = 0.045). there remain significant sources ofuncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratioeven assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. wedetermine the z &lt; 0.05 gsmf using the new york university - value-added galaxycatalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the sloan digital sky survey andvarious estimates of stellar mass. the gsmf shows clear evidence for a low-massupturn and is fitted with a double schechter function that has alpha_2 =~ -1.6.at masses below ~ 10^8.5 msun, the gsmf may be significantly incomplete becauseof missing low surface-brightness galaxies. one interpretation of the stellarmass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction ofavailable baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. using thisprincipal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellarmass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. this function has afaint-end slope, alpha_2 =~ -1.9. thus, we find evidence that the slope of thelow-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as thehalo mass function. we illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic massfunction --&gt; galaxy baryonic mass function --&gt; gsmf. this demonstrates therequirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~ 10^11msun corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. the baryonic-infallefficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.

1503.04813	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) blended spectra catalog: strong  galaxy-galaxy lens and occulting galaxy pair candidates	we present the catalogue of blended galaxy spectra from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. these are cases where light from two galaxies aresignificantly detected in a single gama fibre. galaxy pairs identified fromtheir blended spectrum fall into two principal classes: they are either stronglenses, a passive galaxy lensing an emission-line galaxy; or occultinggalaxies, serendipitous overlaps of two galaxies, of any type. blended spectracan thus be used to reliably identify strong lenses for follow-up observations(high resolution imaging) and occulting pairs, especially those that are alate-type partly obscuring an early-type galaxy which are of interest for thestudy of dust content of spiral and irregular galaxies. the gama survey setupand its autoz automated redshift determination were used to identify candidateblended galaxy spectra from the cross-correlation peaks. we identify 280blended spectra with a minimum velocity separation of 600 km/s, of which 104are lens pair candidates, 71 emission-line-passive pairs, 78 are pairs ofemission-line galaxies and and 27 are pairs of galaxies with passive spectra.we have visually inspected the candidates in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and kilo degree survey (kids) images. many blended objects areellipticals with blue fuzz (ef in our classification). these latter "ef"classifications are candidates for possible strong lenses, massive ellipticalswith an emission-line galaxy in one or more lensed images. the gama lens andocculting galaxy candidate samples are similar in size to those identified inthe entire sdss. this blended spectrum sample stands as a testament of thepower of this highly complete, second-largest spectroscopic survey in existenceand offers the possibility to expand e.g., strong gravitational lens surveys.

1505.06947	h-atlas/gama and hevics - dusty early-type galaxies in different  environments	the herschel space observatory has had a tremendous impact on the study ofextragalactic dust. specifically, early-type galaxies (etg) have been the focusof several studies. in this paper we combine results from two herschel studies- a virgo cluster study hevics and a broader, low-redshift h-atlas/gama study -and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. thiscomparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multipleherschel studies of early-type galaxies. a comparison between consistentmodified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strongdifferences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar massratio. in particular, the hevics sample lacks massive etg with as high aspecific dust content as found in h-atlas. this is most likely connected withthe difference in environment for the two samples. we calculate nearestneighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that h-atlas etgoccupy sparser regions of the local universe, whereas hevics etg occupy denseregions. this is also true for etg that are not herschel-detected but are inthe virgo and gama parent samples. spectral energy distributions are fit to thepanchromatic data. from these we find that in h-atlas the specific starformation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high asin our galaxy. on the other hand hevics etg appear to have little starformation. based on the trends found here, h-atlas etg are thought to have moreextended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than hevicsetg.

1507.04447	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the effect of close interactions on  star formation in galaxies	the modification of star formation (sf) in galaxy interactions is a complexprocess, with sf observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressedin minor pair interactions. such changes likely to arise on short timescalesand be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. here weinvestigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of sf ondifferent timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate(sfr) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass andpair mass ratio. we split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that sf is indeed enhanced inall primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. we findthat changes in sf of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,suggesting that sf in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.we also find that sf is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-timeduration sfr indicators (e.g. h-alpha), highlighting recent changes to sf inthese galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. we propose ascenario where the lower mass galaxy has its sf suppressed by gas heating orstripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its sf enhanced, potentially bytidal gas turbulence and shocks. this is consistent with the seeminglycontradictory observations for both sf suppression and enhancement in closepairs.

0705.2528	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the connection between close pairs and  asymmetry; implications for the galaxy merger rate	we compare the use of galaxy asymmetry and pair proximity for measuringgalaxy merger fractions and rates for a volume limited sample of 3184 galaxieswith -21 &lt; m(b) -5 log h &lt; -18 mag. and 0.010 &lt; z &lt; 0.123 drawn from themillennium galaxy catalogue. our findings are that:  (i) galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolatedgalaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. at least 35%of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc andvelocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry andare therefore likely to be physically bound.  (ii) among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are eitherinteracting systems or merger remnants. however, a significant fraction ofgalaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars orare fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. merger rates calculated viaasymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sourcesof contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.  (iii) close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods ofmeasuring the merger rate. galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries aresensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.  (iv) the merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetriesis about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}.these results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (dependingon the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate withredshift up to z ~1.

1511.02245	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): growing up in a bad neighbourhood - how  do low-mass galaxies become passive?	both theoretical predictions and observations of the very nearby universesuggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;9.5) are likelyto remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. totest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of bothpassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. we find that passive fractions are higher inboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. we also findthat essentially all passive log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;8.5 galaxies arefound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with amore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. we find that theeffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in formingpassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that thisis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient timefor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. we then present a simplisticmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, itis consistent with our observed results.

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;0506635	the millennium galaxy catalogue: dynamically close galaxy pairs and the  global merger rate	we derive the number of dynamically close companions per galaxy ($n_c$) andtheir total luminosity ($l_c$) for galaxies in the millennium galaxy catalogue:$n_c$ is similar to the fraction of galaxies in close pairs and is directlyrelated to the galaxy merger rate. we find $n_c=0.0174 \pm 0.0015$ and$l_c=(252 \pm 30) \times 10^6$ $l_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-22 &lt; m_b -5 \logh &lt; -19$ with $&lt;z&gt;=0.123$ and $n_c=0.0357 \pm 0.0027$, $l_c= (294 \pm 31)\times 10^6 l_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-21 &lt; m_b -5 \log h &lt; -18$, with$&lt;z&gt;=0.116$. the integrated merger rate to $z=1$ for both samples is about 20%, but this depends sensitively on the fraction of kinematic pairs that aretruly undergoing a merger (assumed here to be 50%), the evolution of the mergerrate (here as $(1+z)^3$) and the adopted timescale for mergers (0.2 and 0.5 gyrfor each sample, respectively). galaxies involved in mergers tend to bemarginally bluer than non-interacting galaxies and show an excess of bothearly-type and very late-type objects and a deficiency of intermediate-typespirals. this suggests that interactions and mergers partly drive the starformation and morphological evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;0508365	the millennium galaxy catalogue: on the natural sub-division of galaxies	the distribution of global photometric, spectroscopic, structural andmorphological parameters for a well defined sample of 350 nearby galaxies hasbeen examined. the usual trends were recovered demonstrating that e/s0 galaxiesare redder, more quiescent, more centrally concentrated and possess largersersic indices than later type galaxies.  multivariate statistical analyses were performed to examine the distributionof all parameters simultaneously. the main result of these analyses was theexistence of only two classes of galaxies, corresponding closely to early andlate types. linear discriminant analysis was able to reproduce theclassifications of early and late types galaxies with high success, but furtherrefinement of galaxy types was not reproduced in the distribution of observedgalaxy properties. a principal components analysis showed that the majorvariance of the parameter set corresponded to a distinction between early andlate types, highlighting the importance of the distinction. a hierarchicalclustering analysis revealed only two clear natural classes within theparameter set, closely corresponding to early and late types. early and latetypes are clearly distinct and the distinction is of fundamental importance. incontrast, late types from sa to irr are smoothly distributed throughout theparameter space.  a population of galaxies classified by eye as elliptical/lenticular, andexhibiting concentration indices similar to early-types were found to have asignificant star-formation activity. these galaxies are preferentially faint,suggesting they are low-mass systems.

astro-ph;0510129	luminosity segregation in three clusters of galaxies (a119, 2443, 2218)	we use deep wide-field v-band imaging obtained with the wide field camera atthe prime focus of the issac newton telescope to study the spatial andluminosity distribution of galaxies in three low redshift (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.2)clusters: abell 119, abell 2443 and abell 2218. the absolute magnitude limitsprobed in these clusters are m_{v} - 5logh_{0.7} = -13.3, -15.4 and -16.7magrespectively. the galaxy population, at all luminosities, along theline-of-sight to the clusters can be described by the linear combination of aking profile and a constant surface density of field galaxies. we find that,for these three clusters, the core radius is invariant with intrinsicluminosity of the cluster population to the above limits and thus there is noevidence for luminosity segregation in these clusters. the exception is thebrightest galaxies in a2218 which exhibit a more compact spatial distribution.we find the total projected luminosity distribution (within 1mpc of the clustercentre) can be well represented by a single schechter function with moderatelyflat faint-end slopes: alpha=-1.22 (a119), alpha=-1.11 (a2443) and alpha=-1.14(a2218). we perform a geometric deprojection of the cluster galaxy populationand confirm that no `statistically significant' evidence of a change in theshape of the luminosity distribution with cluster-centric radius exists. again,the exception being a2218 which exhibits a core region with a flatter faint-endslope.

astro-ph;0604211	the millennium galaxy catalogue: a census of local compact galaxies	we use the millennium galaxy catalogue (mgc) to study the effect of compactgalaxies on the local field galaxy luminosity function. here we observationallydefine as `compact' galaxies that are too small to be reliably distinguishedfrom stars using a standard star-galaxy separation technique. in particular, weestimate the fraction of galaxies that are misclassified as stars due to theircompactness. we have spectroscopically identified all objects to b_mgc = 20 magin a 1.14 deg^2 sub-region of the mgc, regardless of morphology. from thesedata we develop a model of the high surface brightness incompleteness andestimate that ~1 per cent of galaxies with b_mgc &lt; 20 mag are misclassified asstars, with an upper limit of 2.3 per cent at 95 per cent confidence. however,since the missing galaxies are preferentially sub-l* their effect on the faintend of the luminosity function is substantially amplified: we find that theycontribute ~6 per cent to the total luminosity function in the range -17 &lt; m_b&lt; -14 mag, which raises the faint end slope alpha by 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}.their contribution to the total b-band luminosity density is ~2 per cent.roughly half of the missing galaxies have already been recovered throughspectroscopy of morphologically stellar targets selected mainly by colour. wefind that the missing galaxies mostly consist of intrinsically small, blue,star-forming, sub-l* objects. in combination with the recent results of driveret al. (2005) we have now demonstrated that the mgc is free from both high andlow surface brightness selection bias for giant galaxies (m_b &lt;~ -17 mag).dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, are significantly affected by theseselection effects. to gain a complete view of the dwarf population will requireboth deeper and higher resolution surveys.

astro-ph;0607629	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the luminosity function of  luminous red galaxies to z=0.6	we present new measurements of the luminosity function (lf) of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) survey. we have carefully quantified, and corrected for,uncertainties in the k and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colourselection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we arestudying the same galaxy population in both surveys. using a limited subset of6326 sdss lrgs (with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.24) and 1725 2slaq lrgs (with 0.5 &lt;z&lt;0.6), forwhich the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence forany additional evolution in the lrg lf, over this redshift range, beyond thatexpected from a simple passive evolution model. this lack of additionalevolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of sdss and 2slaqlrgs, brighter than m_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 l_sunmpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 l_sun mpc^-3 respectively (&lt;10% uncertainty). wecompare our lfs to the combo-17 data and find excellent agreement over the sameredshift range. together, these surveys show no evidence for additionalevolution (beyond passive) in the lf of lrgs brighter than m_r - 5logh = -21(or brighter than l*). we test our sdss and 2slaq lfs against a simple ``drymerger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at leasthalf of the lrgs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more thanhalf their stellar mass) by z=0.6. this limit is barely consistent with recentresults from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0701188	the luminosity-size relation of galaxies to z=1?	we use the hubble ultra deep field (udf) to study the galaxy luminosity-size(m-re) distribution. with a careful analysis of selection effects due to bothdetection completeness and measurement reliability we identify bias-freeregions in the m-re plane for a series of volume-limited samples. we alsoinvestigate the colour-log(n) distribution of these galaxies and furthersubdivide our data by structural type to separately study compact and diffuseobjects. by comparison to the nearby millennium galaxy catalogue, we presenttenative evidence for evolution of diffuse, disk-like galaxies with redshift --both in mean surface brightness and the slope of the m-re relation. in contrastwe find no evidence of structural evolution in the compact galaxy m-re relationover this redshift range, although there is a suggestion of colour evolution.we also highlight the importance of considering surface brightness dependentmeasurement biases in addition to incompleteness biases. in particular, theincreasing, systematic under-estimation of kron fluxes towards low surfacebrightnesses may cause diffuse, yet luminous, systems to be mistaken for faint,compact objects.

astro-ph;9606139	studies of the association of faint blue and luminous galaxies using the  hitchhiker parallel camera	at b magnitudes &gt;~ 24 there is a well-known excess of galaxies (compared tostandard models) which is probably due to an (evolving) population of sub-l*galaxies at moderate redshifts (&lt;~ 0.4). one particular hypothesis which ishard to test directly via number counts or even redshift surveys is thepossibility that the faint blue galaxies are in fact sub-galactic objectsdestined to merge by the present day to form current giant galaxies. if thiswere the case we might expect to find the faint blue galaxies in the vicinityof ~ l* galaxies (at redshifts =~ 0.2 to 0.4) with which they can merge (theblue galaxies are already known to be weakly clustered among themselves,limiting the possibility for multiple mergers of small fragments).  in this paper we look for evidence of such clustering of faint blue galaxiesaround larger systems using candidates chosen photometrically from deepmulticolour ccd images using the hitchhiker parallel camera. a sample ofcandidate l$^\ast$ galaxies expected to lie at redshifts z =~ 0.2 to 0.4 hasbeen selected on the basis of apparent magnitude (b = 20.5 to 22.0 mag.) andcolours typical of early-type spirals. the distribution of 152 blue galaxieshaving 23.5 &lt; b &lt; 25.0, (b-r)c &lt; 1.2, around 13 candidate l* galaxies has beendetermined. no evidence has been found for any preferential clustering of bluegalaxies about the l* candidates; the observed overdensity within 60 arcsec ofthe l* candidates is -0.02 +/- 0.76 per candidate. we have also looked forclustering between other photometrically selected samples (such as faint blueand faint red objects). null results have been found in all cases, placingsignificant limits on the scenarios wherein dwarfs at medium redshifts areremoved via mergers with larger objects.

astro-ph;9802092	morphological number-count and redshift distributions to i &lt; 26 from the  hubble deep field: implications for the evolution of ellipticals, spirals and  irregulars	we combine the photometric redshift data of fernandez-soto et al. (1997) withthe morphological data of odewahn et al. (1996) for all galaxies with i &lt; 26.0detected in the hubble deep field. from this combined catalog we generate themorphological galaxy number-counts and corresponding redshift distributions andcompare these to the predictions of high normalization zero- and passive-evolution models. from this comparison we conclude the following: (1) e/s0s areseen in numbers and over a redshift range consistent with zero- or minimalpassive- evolution to i = 24. beyond this limit fewer e/s0s are observed thanpredicted implying a net negative evolutionary process --- luminosity dimming,disassembly or masking by dust --- at i &gt; 24. (2) spiral galaxies are presentin numbers consistent with zero- evolution predictions to i = 22. beyond thismagnitude some net- positive evolution is required. although the number-countsare consistent with the passive-evolution predictions to i=26.0 the redshiftdistributions favor number and luminosity evolution. (3) there is no obviousexplanation for the late-type/irregular class and this category requiresfurther subdivision. while a small fraction of the population lies at lowredshift (i.e. true irregulars), the majority lie at redshifts, 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. at z&gt; 1.5 mergers are frequent and, taken in conjunction with the absence of normalspirals at z &gt; 2, the logical inference is that they represent the progenitorsof normal spirals forming via hierarchical merging.

astro-ph;9802327	hubble deep fever: a faint galaxy diagnosis	the longstanding faint blue galaxy problem is gradually subsiding as a resultof technological advancement, most notably from high-resolution hubble spacetelescope imaging. in particular two categorical facts have recently beenestablished, these are:  1) the excess faint blue galaxies are of irregular morphologies, and,  2) the majority of these irregulars occur at redshifts 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.  these conclusions are based on the powerful combination of morphological andphotometric redshift data for all galaxies in the hubble deep field to i &lt; 26.our interpretation is that the faint blue galaxy excess, which incidentallycoincides with the peak in the observed mean galaxy star formation rate,represents the final formation epoch of the familiar spiral galaxy population.this conclusion is corroborated by the low abundance of normal spirals at z &gt;2. taking these facts together we favour a scenario where the faint blue excessis primarily due to the formation epoch of spiral systems via merging atredshifts 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. the final interpretation now awaits refinements in ourunderstanding of the local galaxy population !

astro-ph;9804244	the luminosity distribution in galaxy clusters: a dwarf population -  density relation?	recent work suggests that rich clusters of galaxies commonly have largepopulations of dwarf (i.e. low luminosity) members, that is their luminosityfunction (lf) turns up to a steep slope at the faint end. this population, ormore particularly the relative numbers of dwarfs to giants, appears to be verysimilar for clusters of similar morphology, but may vary between cluster types.we have previously suggested that dwarfs may be more common in less compact,spiral rich clusters. similarly we have found evidence for population gradientsacross clusters, in that the dwarf population appears more spatially extended.in the present paper we summarise the current evidence and propose, in analogyto the well-known morphology - density relation, that what we are seeing is adwarf population - density relation; dwarfs are more common in lower densityenvironments. finally we discuss recent semi-analytic models of galaxyformation in the hierarchical clustering picture, which may give clues as tothe origin of our proposed relation.
