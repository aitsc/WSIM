0901.0773	discovery of two distinct red clumps in ngc419: a rare snapshot of a  cluster at the onset of degeneracy	colour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) of the smc star cluster ngc419, derived fromhst/acs data, reveal a well-delineated secondary clump located below theclassical compact red clump typical of intermediate-age populations. wedemonstrate that this feature belongs to the cluster itself, rather than to theunderlying smc field. then, we use synthetic cmds to show that it correspondsvery well to the secondary clump predicted to appear as a result of he-ignitionin stars just massive enough to avoid electron-degeneracy settling in theirh-exhausted cores. the main red clump instead is made of the slightly lessmassive stars which passed through electron-degeneracy and ignited he at thetip of the rgb. in other words, ngc419 is the rare snapshot of a cluster whileundergoing the fast transition from classical to degenerate h-exhausted cores.at this particular moment of a cluster's life, the colour distance between themain sequence turn-off and the red clump(s) depends sensitively on the amountof convective core overshooting, lambda_c. by coupling measurements of thiscolour separation with fits to the red clump morphology, we are able toestimate simultaneously the cluster mean age (1.35(-0.04,+0.11) gyr) andovershooting efficiency (lambda_c=0.47(-0.04,+0.14)). therefore, clusters likengc419 may constitute important marks in the age scale of intermediate-agepopulations. after eye inspection of other cmds derived from hst/acs data, wesuggest that the same secondary clump may also be present in the lmc clustersngc1751, 1783, 1806, 1846, 1852, and 1917.

0912.2638	the star formation history of the smc star cluster ngc419	the rich smc star cluster ngc419 has recently been found to present both abroad main sequence turn-off and a dual red clump of giants, in the sharpcolour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) derived from the high resolution channel of theadvanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope. in this work,we apply to the ngc419 data the classical method of star formation history(sfh) recovery via cmd reconstruction, deriving for the first time thisfunction for a star cluster with multiple turn-offs. the values for the clustermetallicity, reddening, distance and binary fraction, were varied within thelimits allowed by present observations. the global best-fitting solution is anexcellent fit to the data, reproducing all the cmd features with strikingaccuracy. the corresponding star formation rate is provided together withestimates of its random and systematic errors. star formation is found to lastfor at least 700 myr, and to have a marked peak at the middle of this interval,for an age of 1.5 gyr. our findings argue in favour of multiple star formationepisodes (or continued star formation) being at the origin of the multiple mainsequence turn-offs in magellanic cloud clusters with ages around 1 gyr. itremains to be tested whether alternative hypotheses, such as a main sequencespread caused by rotation, could produce similarly good fits to the data.

1002.0592	the asymptotic giant branch and the tip of the red giant branch as  probes of star formation history: the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy kkh 98	we investigate the utility of the asymptotic giant branch (agb) and the redgiant branch (rgb) as probes of the star formation history (sfh) of the nearby(d=2.5 mpc) dwarf irregular galaxy, kkh 98. near-infrared (ir) keck laser guidestar adaptive optics (ao) images resolve 592 ir bright stars reaching over 1magnitude below the tip of the red giant branch. significantly deeper optical(f475w and f814w) hubble space telescope images of the same field contain over2500 stars, reaching to the red clump and the main sequence turn-off for 0.5gyr old populations. compared to the optical color magnitude diagram (cmd), thenear-ir cmd shows significantly tighter agb sequences, providing a good probeof the intermediate age (0.5 - 5 gyr) populations. we match observed cmds withstellar evolution models to recover the sfh of kkh 98. on average, the galaxyhas experienced relatively constant low-level star formation (5 x 10^-4 moyr^-1) for much of cosmic time. except for the youngest main sequencepopulations (age &lt; 0.1 gyr), which are typically fainter than the ao data fluxlimit, the sfh estimated from the the 592 ir bright stars is a reasonable matchto that derived from the much larger optical data set. differences between theoptical and ir derived sfhs for 0.1 - 1 gyr populations suggest that currentstellar evolution models may be over-producing the agb by as much as a factorof three in this galaxy. at the depth of the ao data, the ir luminous stars arenot crowded. therefore these techniques can potentially be used to determinethe stellar populations of galaxies at significantly further distances.

1009.4618	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ix. constraining asymptotic giant  branch evolution with old metal-poor galaxies	in an attempt to constrain evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch(agb) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examinedthe luminosity functions and number ratio between agb and red giant branch(rgb) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the acs nearby galaxysurvey treasury (angst). this database provides hst optical photometry togetherwith maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories fordozens of galaxies within 4 mpc. we select 12 galaxies characterized bypredominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue rgb,and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in theircolor--magnitude diagrams. thousands of agb stars brighter than the tip of thergb (trgb) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence thepoisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the agb/rgb ratio. wemodel the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing agb (tp-agb)evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. thistechnique allows us to set stringent constraints to the tp-agb models oflow-mass metal-poor stars (with m&lt;1.5 msun, [fe/h]&lt;~-1.0). indeed, those whichsatisfactorily reproduce the observed agb/rgb ratios have tp-agb lifetimesbetween 1.2 and 1.8 myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with massesbetween 0.51 and 0.55 msun. this is also in good agreement with recentobservations of white dwarf masses in the m4 old globular cluster. theseconstraints can be added to those already derived from magellanic cloud starclusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating agbevolutionary models.

1101.1880	can rotation explain the multiple main sequence turn-offs of magellanic  cloud star clusters?	many intermediate age star clusters in the magellanic clouds present multiplemain sequence turn-offs (mmsto), which challenge the classical idea that starformation in such objects took place over short timescales. it has beenrecently suggested that the presence of fast rotators among main sequence starscould be the cause of such features (bastian &amp; de mink 2009), hence relaxingthe need for extended periods of star formation. in this letter, we computeevolutionary tracks and isochrones of models with and without rotation. we findthat, for the same age and input physics, both kinds of models presentturn-offs with an almost identical position in the colour-magnitude diagrams.as a consequence, a dispersion of rotational velocities in coeval ensembles ofstars could not explain the presence of mmstos. we construct several syntheticcolour-magnitude diagrams for the different kinds of tracks and combinations ofthem. the models that best reproduce the morphology of observed mmstos areclearly those assuming a significant spread in the stellar ages - as long as~400 myr - added to a moderate amount of convective core overshooting. onlythese models produce the detailed "golf club" shape of observed mmstos. aspread in rotational velocities alone cannot do anything similar. we alsodiscuss models involving a mixture of stars with and without overshooting, asan additional scenario to producing mmstos with coeval populations. we findthat they produce turn-offs with a varying extension in the cmd directionperpendicular to the lower main sequence, which are clearly not present inobserved mmstos.

1102.2814	the star formation history of the large magellanic cloud star cluster  ngc1751	the hst/acs colour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) of the populous lmc star clusterngc1751 present both a broad main sequence turn-off and a dual clump of redgiants. we show that the latter feature is real and associate it to the firstappearance of electron-degeneracy in the h-exhausted cores of the clusterstars. we then apply to the ngc1751 data the classical method of star formationhistory (sfh) recovery via cmd reconstruction, for different radiicorresponding to the cluster centre, the cluster outskirts, and the underlyinglmc field. the mean sfh derived from the lmc field is taken into account duringthe stage of sfh-recovery in the cluster regions, in a novel approach which isshown to significantly improve the quality of the sfh results. for the clustercentre, we find a best-fitting solution corresponding to prolonged starformation for a for a timespan of 460 myr, instead of the two peaks separatedby 200 myr favoured by a previous work based on isochrone fitting. remarkably,our global best-fitting solution provides an excellent fit to the data - withchi^2 and residuals close to the theoretical minimum - reproducing all the cmdfeatures including the dual red clump. the results for a larger ring regionaround the centre indicate even longer star formation, but in this case theresults are of lower quality, probably because of the differential extinctiondetected in the area. therefore, the presence of age gradients in ngc1751 couldnot be probed. together with our previous findings for the smc cluster ngc419,the present results for the ngc1751 centre argue in favour of multiple starformation episodes (or continued star formation) being at the origin of themultiple main sequence turn-offs in magellanic cloud clusters with ages around1.5 gyr.

(2000). theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of ageand metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. we take carethat the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several peculiaritiespresent in these tp-agb tracks. theoretical isochrones are then converted toabout 20 different photometric systems -- including traditional ground-basedsystems, and those of recent major wide-field surveys such as sdss, ogle,denis, 2mass, ukidss, etc., -- by means of synthetic photometry applied to anupdated library of stellar spectra, suitably extended to include c-type stars.finally, we correct the predicted photometry by the effect of circumstellardust during the mass-losing stages of the agb evolution, which allows us toimprove the results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid-and far-ir systems such as those of spitzer and akari. access to the data isprovided both via a web repository of static tables(http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyagb07 and cds), and via an interactive webinterface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd) that provides tables for anyintermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric systems, andfor different choices of dust properties.

1301.3381	the star formation history of the large magellanic cloud star clusters  ngc1846 and ngc1783	ngc1846 and ngc1783 are two massive star clusters in the large magellaniccloud, hosting both an extended main sequence turn-off and a dual clump of redgiants. they present similar masses but differ mainly in angular size. startingfrom their high-quality acs data in the f435w, f555w and f814w filters, andupdated sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, we derive their star formationrates as a function of age, sfr(t), by means of the classical method of cmdreconstruction which is usually applied to nearby galaxies. the method confirmsthe extended periods of star formation derived from previous analysis of thesame data. when the analysis is performed for a finer resolution in age, wefind clear evidence for a 50-myr long hiatus between the oldest peak in thesfr(t), and a second prolonged period of star formation, in both clusters. forthe more compact cluster ngc1846, there seems to be no significant differencebetween the sfr(t) in the cluster centre and in an annulus with radii between20 and 60 arcsec (from 4.8 to 15.4 pc). the same does not occur in the moreextended ngc1783 cluster, where the outer ring (between 33 and 107 arcsec, from8.0 to 25.9 pc) is found to be slightly younger than the centre. we alsoexplore the best-fitting slope of the present-day mass function and binaryfraction for the different cluster regions, finding hints of a varying massfunction between centre and outer ring in ngc1783. these findings are discussedwithin the present scenarios for the formation of clusters with multipleturn-offs.

1305.4485	evolution of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars i. the  colibri code	we present the colibri code for computing the evolution of stars along thetp-agb phase. compared to purely synthetic tp-agb codes, colibri relaxes asignificant part of their analytic formalism in favour of a detailed physicsapplied to a complete envelope model, in which the stellar structure equationsare integrated from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the hydrogen-burningshell. this allows to predict self-consistently: (i) the effective temperature,and more generally the convective envelope and atmosphere structures, correctlycoupled to the changes in the surface chemical abundances and gas opacities;(ii) sphericity effects in the atmospheres; (iii) the core mass-luminosityrelation and its break-down due to hot bottom burning (hbb) in the most massiveagb stars, (iv) the hbb nucleosynthesis via the solution of a complete nuclearnetwork (pp chains, and the cno, nena, mgal cycles), including also theproduction of 7li via the cameron-fowler beryllium transport mechanism; (v) thechemical composition of the pulse-driven convective zone; (vi) the onset andquenching of the third dredge-up, with a suitable temperature criterion. at thesame time colibri pioneers new techniques in the treatment of the physics ofstellar interiors. it is the first evolutionary code ever to use accurateon-the-fly computation of the equation of state for roughly 800 atoms, ions,molecules, and of the rosseland mean opacities throughout the deep envelope.another distinguishing aspect of colibri is its high computational speed. thisfeature is necessary for calibrating the uncertain parameters and processesthat characterize the tp-agb phase, a step of paramount importance forproducing reliable stellar population synthesis models of galaxies up to highredshift.

1308.6088	the insidious boosting of tp-agb stars in intermediate-age magellanic  cloud clusters	(abridged) in the recent controversy about the role of tp-agb stars inevolutionary population synthesis (eps) models of galaxies, one particularaspect is puzzling: tp-agb models aimed at reproducing the lifetimes andintegrated fluxes of the tp-agb phase in magellanic cloud (mc) clusters, whenincorporated into eps models, are found to overestimate the tp-agb contributionin resolved star counts and integrated spectra of galaxies. in this paper, wecall attention to a particular evolutionary aspect that in all probability isthe main cause of this conundrum. as soon as stellar populations intercept theages at which rgb stars first appear, a sudden change in the lifetime of thecore he-burning phase causes a temporary boost in the production rate ofsubsequent evolutionary phases, including the tp-agb. for a timespan of about0.1 gyr, triple tp-agb branches develop at slightly different initial masses,causing their frequency and contribution to the integrated luminosity of thestellar population to increase by a factor of 2. the boost occurs just in theproximity of the expected peak in the tp-agb lifetimes, and for ages of 1.6gyr. coincidently, this relatively narrow age interval happens to contain thefew very massive mc clusters that host most of the tp-agb stars used toconstrain stellar evolution and eps models. this concomitance makes theagb-boosting particularly insidious in the context of present eps models. theeffect brings about three main consequences. (1) present estimates of thetp-agb contribution to the integrated light of galaxies derived from mcclusters, are biased towards too large values. (2) the relative tp-agbcontribution of single-burst populations falling in this critical age rangecannot be accurately derived by the fuel consumption theorem. (3) a carefulrevision of agb star populations in intermediate-age mc clusters is urgentlydemanded.

1407.6957	new clues to the cause of extended main sequence turn-offs in  intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds	we use the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope(hst) to obtain deep, high resolution images of two intermediate-age starclusters in the large magellanic cloud of relatively low mass ($\approx$ $10^4$$m_{\odot}$) and significantly different core radii, namely ngc2209 andngc2249. for comparison purposes, we also re-analyzed archival hst images ofngc1795 and ic2146, two other relatively low mass star clusters. from thecomparison of the observed color-magnitude diagrams with monte carlosimulations, we find that the main sequence turnoff (msto) regions in ngc2209and ngc2249 are significantly wider than that derived from simulations ofsimple stellar populations, while those in ngc1795 and ic2146 are not. wedetermine the evolution of the clusters' masses and escape velocities from anage of 10 myr to the present age. we find that the differences among theseclusters can be explained by dynamical evolution arguments if the currentlyextended clusters (ngc2209 and ic2146) experienced stronger levels of initialmass segregation than the currently compact ones (ngc2249 and ngc1795). underthis assumption, we find that ngc2209 and ngc2249 have estimated escapevelocities $v_{\rm esc}$ $\geq$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ at an age of 10 myr, largeenough to retain material ejected by slow winds of first-generation stars,while the two clusters that do not feature extended mstos have $v_{\rm esc}$$\leq$ 12 km s$^{-1}$ at that age. these results suggest that the extended mstophenomenon can be better explained by a range of stellar ages rather than arange of stellar rotation velocities or interacting binaries.

1409.0899	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury x. ultraviolet to infrared  photometry of 117 million equidistant stars	we have measured stellar photometry with the hubble space telescope (hst)wide field camera 3 (wfc3) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) in nearultraviolet (f275w, f336w), optical (f475w, f814w), and near infrared (f110w,f160w) bands for 117 million resolved stars in m31. as part of the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, we measured photometry withsimultaneous point spread function fitting across all bands and at all sourcepositions after precise astrometric image alignment (&lt;5-10 milliarcsecondaccuracy). in the outer disk, the photometry reaches a completeness-limiteddepth of f475w~28, while in the crowded, high surface brightness bulge, thephotometry reaches f475w~25. we find that simultaneous photometry and optimizedmeasurement parameters significantly increase the detection limit of the lowestresolution filters (wfc3/ir) providing color-magnitude diagrams that are up to2.5 magnitudes deeper when compared with color-magnitude diagrams from wfc3/irphotometry alone. we present extensive analysis of the data quality includingcomparisons of luminosity functions and repeat measurements, and we useartificial star tests to quantify photometric completeness, uncertainties andbiases. we find that largest sources of systematic error in the photometry aredue to spatial variations in the point spread function models and chargetransfer efficiency corrections. this stellar catalog is the largest everproduced for equidistant sources, and is publicly available for download by thecommunity.

1410.3840	extended main sequence turnoffs in intermediate-age star clusters: a  correlation between turnoff width and early escape velocity	we present color-magnitude diagram analysis of deep hubble space telescopeimaging of a mass-limited sample of 18 intermediate-age (1 - 2 gyr old) starclusters in the magellanic clouds, including 8 clusters for which new data wasobtained. we find that ${\it all}$ star clusters in our sample feature extendedmain sequence turnoff (emsto) regions that are wider than can be accounted forby a simple stellar population (including unresolved binary stars). fwhm widthsof the mstos indicate age spreads of 200-550 myr. we evaluate dynamicalevolution of clusters with and without initial mass segregation. our mainresults are: (1) the fraction of red clump (rc) stars in secondary rcs in emstoclusters scales with the fraction of msto stars having pseudo-ages $\leq 1.35$gyr; (2) the width of the pseudo-age distributions of emsto clusters iscorrelated with their central escape velocity $v_{\rm esc}$, both currently andat an age of 10 myr. we find that these two results are unlikely to bereproduced by the effects of interactive binary stars or a range of stellarrotation velocities. we therefore argue that the emsto phenomenon is mainlycaused by extended star formation within the clusters; (3) we find that $v_{\rmesc} \geq 15$ km/s out to ages of at least 100 myr for ${\it all}$ clustersfeaturing emstos, while $v_{\rm esc} \leq 12$ km/s at all ages for twolower-mass clusters in the same age range that do ${\it not}$ show emstos. weargue that emstos only occur for clusters whose early escape velocities arehigher than the wind velocities of stars that provide material from whichsecond-generation stars can form. the threshold of 12-15 km/s is consistentwith wind velocities of intermediate-mass agb stars in the literature.

1501.05347	the vmc survey - xiv. first results on the look-back time star-formation  rate tomography of the small magellanic cloud	we analyse deep images from the vista survey of the magellanic clouds in theyjks filters, covering 14 sqrdeg (10 tiles), split into 120 subregions, andcomprising the main body and wing of the small magellanic cloud (smc). we applya colour--magnitude diagram reconstruction method that returns theirbest-fitting star formation rate sfr(t), age-metallicity relation (amr),distance and mean reddening, together with 68% confidence intervals. thedistance data can be approximated by a plane tilted in the east-west directionwith a mean inclination of 39 deg, although deviations of up to 3 kpc suggest adistorted and warped disk. after assigning to every observed star a probabilityof belonging to a given age-metallicity interval, we build high-resolutionpopulation maps. these dramatically reveal the flocculent nature of the youngstar-forming regions and the nearly smooth features traced by older stellargenerations. they document the formation of the smc wing at ages &lt;0.2 gyr andthe peak of star formation in the smc bar at 40 myr. we clearly detect periodsof enhanced star formation at 1.5 gyr and 5 gyr. the former is possibly relatedto a new feature found in the amr, which suggests ingestion of metal-poor gasat ages slightly larger than 1 gyr. the latter constitutes a major period ofstellar mass formation. we confirm that the sfr(t) was moderately low at evenolder ages.

1501.06631	tracing the metal-poor m31 stellar halo with blue horizontal branch  stars	we have analyzed new hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging in f475w and f814w of twopreviously-unobserved fields along the m31 minor axis to confirm our previousconstraints on the shape of m31's inner stellar halo. both of these newdatasets reach a depth of at least f814w$&lt;$27 and clearly detect the bluehorizontal branch (bhb) of the field as a distinct feature of thecolor-magnitude diagram. we measure the density of bhb stars and the ratio ofbhb to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to ourprevious work. we find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of apower-law for the 2-d projected surface density with an index of2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\alpha &lt;$1.2 inside of3 kpc. our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field bhb stars inm31 are part of the halo population. however, the total halo profile is nowknown to differ from this bhb profile, which suggests that we have isolated themetal-poor component. this component appears to have an unbroken power-lawprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halostellar mass. discrepancies between the bhb density profile and othermeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the differentprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than theprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. theseprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of bhb/rgb stars inour observations.

1503.07862	on the interpretation of sub-giant branch morphologies of  intermediate-age star clusters with extended main sequence turnoffs	recent high-quality photometry of many star clusters in the magellanic cloudswith ages of 1$\,-\,$2 gyr revealed main sequence turnoffs (mstos) that aresignificantly wider than can be accounted for by a simple stellar population(ssp). such extended mstos (emstos) are often interpreted in terms of an agespread of several $10^8$ yr, challenging the traditional view of star clustersas being formed in a single star formation episode. li et al. and bastian &amp;niederhofer recently investigated the sub-giant branches (sgbs) of ngc 1651,ngc 1806, and ngc 1846, three star clusters in the large magellanic cloud (lmc)that exhibit an emsto. they argued that the sgb of these star clusters can beexplained only by a ssp. we study these and two other similar star clusters inthe lmc, using extensive simulations of ssps including unresolved binaries. wefind that the shapes of the cross-sgb profiles of all star clusters in oursample are in fact consistent with their cross-msto profiles when the latterare interpreted as age distributions. conversely, sgb morphologies of starclusters with emstos are found to be inconsistent with those of simulated ssps.finally, we create parsec isochrones from tracks featuring a grid of convectiveovershoot levels and a very fine grid of stellar masses. a comparison of theobserved photometry with these isochrones shows that the morphology of the redclump (rc) of such star clusters is also consistent with that implied by theirmsto in the age spread scenario. we conclude that the sgb and rc morphologiesof star clusters featuring emstos are consistent with the scenario in which theemstos are caused by a distribution of stellar ages.

1507.06687	a spectroscopic and photometric exploration of the c/m ratio in the disk  of m31	we explore the ratio (c/m) of carbon-rich to oxygen-rich thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch(tp-agb) stars in the disk of m31 using a combination ofmoderate-resolution optical spectroscopy from the spectroscopic landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey and six-filter hubble space telescopephotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey.carbonstars were identified spectroscopically. oxygen-rich m-stars were identifedusing three different photometric definitions designed to mimic, and thusevaluate, selection techniques common in the literature. we calculate the c/mratio as a function of galactocentric radius, present-day gas-phase oxygenabundance, stellar metallicity, age (via proxy defined as the ratio of tp-agbstars to red giant branch, rgb, stars), and mean star formation rate over thelast 400 myr. we find statistically significant correlations between log(c/m)and all parameters. these trends are consistent across different m-starselection methods, though the fiducial values change. of particular note is ourobserved relationship between log(c/m) and stellar metallicity, which is fullyconsistent with the trend seen across local group satellite galaxies. the factthat this trend persists in stellar populations with very different starformation histories indicates that the c/m ratio is governed by stellarproperties alone.

1511.04088	determining ages of apogee giants with known distances	we present a sample of local red giant stars observed using the new mexicostate university 1 m telescope with the apogee spectrograph, for which weestimate stellar ages and the age distribution from the high-resolutionspectroscopic stellar parameters and accurate distance measurements fromhipparcos. the high-resolution (r ~ 23,000), near infrared (h-band, 1.5-1.7micron) apogee spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmosphericparameters (temperature, surface gravity, [m/h], and [alpha/m]). due to thesmaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectraand accurate hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate thestellar masses to within 40%. for red giants, the relatively rapid evolution ofstars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on themass. we examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relationdirectly and a bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming aconstant star formation history (sfh). to improve the prior on the sfh, we usea hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model sfhfrom the age probability distribution functions of the data. the results of analpha dependent gaussian sfh model shows a clear relation between age and[alpha/m] at all ages. using this sfh model as the prior for an empiricalbayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution functionand determine ages for individual stars. the age-metallicity relation is flat,with a slight decrease in [m/h] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread inmetallicity. for stars with ages &lt; 1 gyr we find a smaller spread, consistentwith radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on theolder stars.

astro-ph;0007343	population effects on the red giant clump absolute magnitude, and  distance determinations to nearby galaxies	(abridged) the red giant clump has been recently argued to be a reliabledistance indicator for the galaxies in the local group. we re-address theproblem of the systematic magnitude differences (deltam_i) between the localclump revealed by hipparcos, and the clump stars observed in distant galaxies.first, we present tables and equations with the theoretically-predicted clumpm_i as a function of age and metallicity, that allow the computation ofdeltam_i for any given galaxy model. we then explain in some detail whatdetermines the distribution of masses, ages, and metallicities of clump starsin a galaxy. we point out that in galaxies with recent/ongoing star formation,the age distribution of clump stars is strongly biased toward younger (1-3 gyr)ages, and hence toward higher metallicities. obviously, this does not happen ingalaxies with predominantly old stellar populations. we construct a model forthe local clump that is shown to produce distributions of metallicities,colours, and magnitudes, similar to those derived from spectroscopic andhipparcos data. bulge, magellanic clouds, and carina dsph models are used toanalyse the values of deltam_i for these systems. we show how the clump-rrlyrae data is well reproduced by the models. however, despite this, the modelsindicate that the linear deltam_i vs. [fe/h] relations that have been derivedfrom the data are not general. finally, we provide revised clump distances tothe bulge, magellanic clouds, and carina dsph. the largest deltam_i values arefound for the magellanic clouds and carina dsph, which turn out to be locatedat distance moduli 0.2-0.3 mag longer than indicated by works which ignorepopulation effects. the galactic bulge, instead, may be slightly closer (0.1mag) than indicated by previous works based on the red clump.

astro-ph;0107563	coupling emitted light and chemical yields from stars: a basic  constraint to population synthesis models of galaxies	in this paper we emphasize the close connection between the chemical andspectrophotometric evolution of stellar systems: chemical yields from starscorrespond to a precise fraction of their emitted light. we translate thisconcept quantitatively. starting from simple stellar populations, we deriveuseful analytical relations to calculate the stellar fuel consumption (emittedlight) as a function of basic quantities predicted by stellar models, i.e. themass of the core and the chemical composition of the envelope. the finalformulas explicate the relation between integrated light contribution (total orlimited to particular evolutionary phases), chemical yields and stellarremnants. we test their accuracy in the case of low- and intermediate-massstars, and indicate the way to extend the analysis to massive stars. thisformalism provides an easy tool to check the internal consistency between thedifferent stellar inputs adopted in galaxy models: the fuel computed by meansof the analytical formulas (corresponding to a given set of chemical yields)should be compared to the exact values given by the luminosity integrationalong the stellar evolutionary tracks or isochrones (corresponding to a givenset of spectrophotometric models). only if both estimates of the fuel aresimilar, the stellar inputs can be considered self-consistent in terms of theirenergetics. this sets an important requirement to galaxy models, also inconsideration of the fact that different sources of input stellar data arefrequently used to model their spectro-photometric and chemical evolution.

(1999) reached the conclusion that the classical scheme forthe treatment of convection represents a good and sufficient approximation forconvective interiors. using their own data, we repeat here the analysis. firstwe revise the procedure followed by testa et al. (1999) to correct the data forcompleteness, second we calculate new stellar models with updated physicalinput for both evolutionary schemes, finally we present many simulations of thecolour-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions of the cluster using theratio of the integrated luminosity function of main sequence stars to thenumber of giants as the normalization factor of the simulations. we also takeinto account several possible physical agents that could alter thecolor-magnitude diagram and the luminosity function: they are unresolved binarystars, dispersion in the age, stochastic effects in the initial mass function.their effect is analyzed separately, with the conclusion that binary stars havethe largest impact. the main result of this study is that the convectiveovershoot hypothesis (together with a suitable percentage of unresolvedbinaries) is really needed to fully match the whole pattern of data. the maindrawback of the classical models is that they cannot reproduce the correctratio of main sequence to post-main sequence stars.

astro-ph;0207121	does the mixing length parameter depend on metallicity?	this paper is a further step in the investigation of the morphology of thecolor-magnitude diagram of galactic globular clusters, and the fine-tuning oftheoretical models, made possible by the recent observational efforts to buildhomogeneous photometric databases. in particular, we examine here thecalibration of the morphological parameter w(hb) vs. metallicity, originallyproposed by brocato et al. (1998), which essentially measures the colorposition of the red-giant branch. we show that the parameter can be used tohave a first-order estimate of the cluster metallicity, since the dispersionaround the mean trend with [fe/h] is compatible with the measurement errors.the tight w(hb)-[fe/h] relation is then used to show that variations in heliumcontent or age do not affect the parameter, whereas it is strongly influencedby the mixing-length parameter alpha (as expected). this fact allows us, forthe first time, to state that there is no trend of alpha with the metal contentof a cluster. a thorough examination of the interrelated questions of thealpha-elements enhancement and the color-t(eff) transformations, highlightsthat there is an urgent need for an independent assessment of which of the twopresently accepted metallicity scales is the true indicator of a cluster's ironcontent. whatever scenario is adopted, it also appears that a deep revision ofthe (v-i)-temperature relations is needed.

astro-ph;0412156	tip of the red giant branch distances to galaxies with composite stellar  populations	(abridged) we have investigated the reliability of the widely used i-band tipof the rgb relative distances for a sample of local group galaxies with complexstar formation histories (sfr) and age metallicity relationships (amr) namelythe lmc, smc and lgs3. the use of the k-band is also discussed. by employingtheoretical stellar population synthesis techniques, we find that using actualdeterminations of sfr and amr of the lmc and smc, their rgb is populated bystars much younger (by 9 gyr) than the galactic globular cluster counterparts,on which the i-band (and k-band) trgb absolute magnitude is calibrated. thisage difference induces a bias in both the photometric metallicity estimatesbased on the comparison of rgb colours with globular cluster ones, and the trgbdistances. the extent of the distance bias is strongly dependent on thespecific trgb technique applied, and on the assumed i-band bc scale adopted;the correction to apply to the smc-lmc distance modulus ranges from 0 up to+0.10 mag. lgs3 is an example of galaxy populated mainly by old stars, so thatphotometric metallicity and distance estimates using globular clustercalibrations are reliable. however, the relative distance moduli betweenmagellanic clouds and lgs3 are affected by the population effects discussed forthe lmc and smc. the corrections to apply to the k-band trgb distances arelarger than the i-band case. our results clearly show that the presence of awell developed rgb in the cmd of a stellar system with a complex sfr does notguarantee that it is populated by globular cluster-like red giants, andtherefore the trgb method for distance determination has to be applied withcaution.

astro-ph;0703139	evolution of asymptotic giant branch stars i. updated synthetic tp-agb  models and their basic calibration	we present new synthetic models of the tp-agb evolution. they are computedfor 7 values of initial metal content (z from 0.0001 to 0.03) and for initialmasses between 0.5 and 5.0 msun, thus extending the low- and intermediate-masstracks of girardi et al. (2000) until the beginning of the post-agb phase. thecalculations are performed by means of a synthetic code that incorporates manyrecent improvements, among which we mention: (1) the use of detailed andrevised analytical relations to describe the evolution of quiescent luminosity,inter-pulse period, third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, pulse cycle luminosityvariations, etc.; (2) the use of variable molecular opacities -- i.e. opacitiesconsistent with the changing photospheric chemical composition -- in theintegration of a complete envelope model, instead of the standard choice ofscaled-solar opacities; (3) the use of formalisms for the mass-loss ratesderived from pulsating dust-driven wind models of c- and o-rich agb stars; and(4) the switching of pulsation modes between the first overtone and thefundamental one along the evolution, which has consequences in terms of thehistory of mass loss. it follows that, in addition to the time evolution on thehr diagram, the new models predict in a consistent fashion also variations insurface chemical compositions, pulsation modes and periods, and mass-lossrates. the onset and efficiency of the third dredge-up process are calibratedin order to reproduce basic observables like the carbon star luminosityfunctions in the magellanic clouds, and tp-agb lifetimes (star counts) inmagellanic cloud clusters. forthcoming papers will present the theoreticalisochrones and chemical yields derived from these tracks, and additional testsperformed with the aid of a complete population synthesis code.

astro-ph;0703766	the helium abundance and delta y / delta z in lower main sequence stars	we use nearby k dwarf stars to measure the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio,a diagnostic of the chemical history of the solar neighbourhood. our sample ofk dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometricluminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriatestellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. we use a newlycomputed set of padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metalcontent. our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous setof main sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss andvalidate their range of applicability. we find that the stellar masses deducedfrom the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empiricalmeasurements. good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosityrelations. despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find thatanomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required tofit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal poor k dwarfs, while moreconventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars aroundsolar metallicity. we have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellarmodels and lte assumption in deriving metallicities. neither of these is ableto resolve the low helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulatedeffects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is stronglydecreasing with metallicity. further work in stellar models is urgently needed.the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be delta y / delta z = 2.1 +/-0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies,whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. finally, wedetermine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.

astro-ph;9801145	the evolution of the v-k colours of single stellar populations	we discuss how the integrated v-k colours of single stellar populationsevolve with age and metallicity. some of the uncertainties associated to theproperties of the underlying stellar models are throughfully discussed. first,we present the effects that different formulations for the mass-loss ratesproduce on the initial-final mass relation, and hence on the integratedcolours. second, we describe the colour changes occurring at the onset of theagb and rgb stars. the onset of the agb is marked by a colour jump to the red,whose amplitude is highly dependent on the metallicity and mass-loss ratesadopted in the models. the overluminosity with respect to the standard mc-lrelation, that occurs in the most massive agb stars, causes a smoothing of thiscolour jump. on the other hand, we find that a transient red phase takes place~1.5x10^8 yr after the rgb develops. we then discuss the possible reasons forthe transition of v-k colours (from ~1.5 to 3) that takes place in lmc clustersof swb type iv. a revision of the ages attributed to the clusters reveals thatthe transition may not be as fast as originally suggested. a gradual (ordelayed) transition of the colours, as predicted by models which include theoverluminosity of the most massive agb stars, describes better the data thanthe sudden colour-jump predicted by classical models.

astro-ph;9812278	near ir photometry of the old open clusters berkeley 17 and berkeley 18.  probing the age of the galactic disc	we report on near ir ($j$ and $k$ bands) observations of two $8 \times 8\~(arcmin)^{2}$ regions centered on the old open clusters berkeley~17 andberkeley~18, for which only optical photometry (in $b$,$v$ and $i$ bands)exists. $j$ and $k$ photometry allows us to obtain an independent estimate ofcluster metallicity by means of the relationship between the spectroscopicmetallicity and the red giant branch (rgb) slope calibrated by tiede et al(1997). from the analysis of the colour magnitude diagram (cmd) and luminosityfunction (lf), berkeley~17 turns out to have a metal content$[fe/h]~\sim~-0.35$. it is $9~gyr$ old, suffers from a reddening $e(b-v) = 0.58mag$ and has an heliocentric distance of $2.5 kpc$. berkeley~17 comes out to besubstantially younger than in previous work (age $\approx 13~gyr$). on theother hand berkeley~18 is found to have solar metal abundance, and to beyounger than berkeley~17, with an age of about $4~gyr$. while we confirmkaluzny (1997) reddening estimate, we significantly revise the distance of thecluster, which lies $4.5 kpc$ from the sun. these results on two open clustersbelieved to be between the oldest put constraints on the age and the evolutionof the galactic disc. the absence of clusters older than $8-9~gyr$ suggests thepossibility that the galaxy underwent a star formation minimum between 13 and$10~gyr$ ago.

astro-ph;9901235	the third dredge-up and the carbon star luminosity functions in the  magellanic clouds	we investigate the formation of carbon stars as a function of the stellarmass and parent metallicity. theoretical modelling is based on an improvedscheme for treating the third dredge-up in synthetic calculations of thermallypulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stars. in this approach, the usualcriterion (based on a constant minimum core mass for the occurrence ofdredge-up, m_c^min) is replaced by one on the minimum temperature at the baseof the convective envelope, t_b^dred, at the stage of the post-flash luminositymaximum. envelope integrations then allow determination of m_c^min as afunction of stellar mass, metallicity, and pulse strength (see wood 1981), thusinferring if and when dredge-up first occurs. moreover, the final possible shutdown of the process is predicted. extensive grids of tp-agb models werecomputed using this scheme. we present and discuss the calibration of the twodredge-up parameters (lambda and t_b^dred) aimed at reproducing the carbon starluminosity function (cslf) in the lmc. it turns out that the faint tail isalmost insensitive to the history of star formation rate (sfr) in the parentgalaxy (it is essentially determined by t_b^dred), in contrast to the brightwing which may be more affected by the details of the recent sfr. once thefaint end is reproduced, the peak location is a stringent calibrator of lambda.the best fit to the observed cslf in the lmc is obtained with z=0.008,lambda=0.50, log(t_b^dred)=6.4, and a constant sfr up to 5x10^8 yr ago. a goodfit to the cslf in the smc is then easily derived from the z=0.004 models, witha single choice of parameters, and a constant sfr over the entire significantage interval. the results are consistent with the theoretical expectation thatthe third dredge-up is more efficient at lower zs.

astro-ph;9901319	a secondary clump of red giant stars: why and where	based on the results of detailed population synthesis models, it was recentlyclaimed that the clump of red giants in the colour-magnitude diagram (cmd) ofcomposite stellar populations should present an extension to lowerluminosities, which goes down to about 0.4 mag below the main clump. thisfeature is made of stars just massive enough for having ignited helium innon-degenerate conditions. in this paper, we go into more details about theorigin and properties of this feature. we first compare the clump theoreticalmodels with data for clusters of different ages and metallicities, basicallyconfirming the predicted behaviours. we then refine the previous models inorder to show that: (i) the faint extension is expected to be clearly separatedfrom the main clump in the cmd of metal-rich populations, defining a secondaryclump by itself. (ii) it should be present in all galactic fields containing ~1gyr old stars and with mean metallicities higher than about z=0.004. (iii) itshould be particularly strong, if compared to the main red clump, in galaxieswhich have increased their star formation rate in the last gyr or so of theirevolution. in fact, secondary clumps similar to the model predictions areobserved in the cmd of nearby stars from hipparcos data, and in those of somelmc fields observed to date. there are also several reasons why this secondaryclump may be missing or hidden in other observed cmds of galaxy fields (e.g.photometric errors or differential absorption larger than 0.2 mag).nonetheless, this structure may provide important constraints to the starformation history of local group galaxies. we comment also on the intrinsicluminosity variation and dispersion of clump stars, which may limit their useas either absolute or relative distance indicators.

astro-ph;9905356	is the galactic disk older than the halo?	aim of this study is to infer the age of the galactic disk by means of theages of old open clusters, and comment on some recent claims that the galacticdisk can be older than the halo. to this purpose, we analyze thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of six very old clusters, namely ngc 188, ngc6791, collinder 261, melotte 66, berkeley 39 and berkeley 17, and determinetheir ages. for each cluster we use the most recent photometric andspectroscopic data and metallicity estimates. the ages are derived from theisochrone fitting method using the stellar models of the padua library(bertelli et al . 1994, girardi et al. 1999). we find that the ages of theseclusters fall in the range 4 to 9-10 gyr: melotte 66 is the youngest whereasngc 6791 and berkeley 17 have ages of about 9-10 gyr. previous estimates forberkeley 17 indicated an age as old as 12 gyr, almost falling within the rangeof classical globular clusters. in our analysis, this cluster is always veryold but perhaps somewhat younger than in previous studies. however we callattention on the fact that the above ages are to be taken as provisionalestimates, because of the many uncertaintes still affecting stellar models inthe mass range 1.0 to 1.5 mo. despite this drawback of extant theory of stellarstructure, if ngc 6791 and berkeley 17 set the limit to the age of the galacticdisk, this component of the milky way can be as old as 9-10 gyr, but surelyyounger than the galactic halo, at least as inferred from recent determinationsof the age of globular clusters. finally, it is worth recalling that openclusters can only provide a lower limit to the age of the galactic disk, whileother indicators - like white dwarfs - are perhaps more suited to this task.

0810.0266	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ii. young stars and their relation  to halpha and uv emission timescales in the m81 outer disk	we have obtained resolved stellar photometry from hubble space telescope(hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of a field in the outerdisk of m81 as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). motivatedby the recent discovery of extended uv (xuv) disks around many nearby spiralgalaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent starformation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field. theseregions were selected on the basis of their uv luminosity from galex andinclude two hii regions, two regions which are uv-bright but halpha-faint, andone "control" region faint in both uv and halpha. we estimate our effective sfrdetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 msun/yr, which is lower than that of galex forregions of this size. as expected, the hii regions contain massive mainsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 msun, based on our best extinctionestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in theuv-bright/halpha-faint regions. the observations are consistent with stellarages &lt;10 myr in the hii regions, and &gt;16 myr in the uv-bright/halpha-faintregions. all regions but the control have formed ~10^4 msun of stars over thepast ~65 myr. thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer diskof m81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain theobserved discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in halpha and thosedetected exclusively in uv. however, our data cannot conclusively rule outother explanations, such as a strongly truncated initial mass function (imf).

0810.2557	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury i. the star formation history of  the m81 outer disk	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a large hubble spacetelescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) treasury program to obtainresolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4mpc. as part of this program, we have obtained deep acs imaging of a field inthe outer disk of the large spiral galaxy m81. the field contains the outskirtsof a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. ourimaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reaching to f814w = 28.8 andf606w = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. through detailedmodeling of the full cmd, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution ofthe stellar populations contained in the field. the mean metallicity in thefield is -1&lt;[m/h]&lt;0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages &lt;~1 gyr. theresults show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z~1and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of &gt;~100 myr. wediscuss the measured evolution of the m81 disk in the context of surveys ofhigh-redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearbygalaxies. all of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed byz~1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.
