0903.3527	multiwavelength photometry in the globular cluster m2	we present a multiwavelength photometric analysis of the globular cluster m2.the data-set has been obtained by combining high-resolution (hst/wfpc2 and acs)and wide-field (galex) space observations and ground based (megacam-cfht,emmi-ntt) images. the photometric sample covers the entire cluster extensionfrom the very central regions up to the tidal radius and beyond. it allows anaccurate determination of the cluster center of gravity and other structuralparameters derived from the star count density profile. moreover we study thebss population and its radial distribution. a total of 123 bss has beenselected, and their radial distribution has been found to be bimodal (highlypeaked in the center, decreasing at intermediate radii and rising outward), asalready found in a number of other clusters. the radial position of the minimumof the bss distribution is consistent with the radius of avoidance caused bythe dynamical friction of massive objects over the cluster age. we alsosearched for gradients in the red giant branch (rgb) and the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) populations. at the $2\sigma$ level we found an overabundance ofagb stars within the core radius and confirmed the result of sohn et al.(1996)that the central region of m2 is bluer than the outer part. we show that thelatter is due to a deficit of very luminous rgb stars in the central region.

0912.0192	the cluster terzan 5 as a remnant of a primordial building block of the  galactic bulge	globular star clusters are compact and massive stellar systems old enough tohave witnessed the entire history of our galaxy, the milky way. although recentresults suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previouslythought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formedover a relatively short time scale (less than 1 gyr) and with virtually nodispersion in the iron content. indeed, only one cluster-like system (omegacentauri) in the galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populationswith a significant spread in iron abundance and age4,5. similar findings in thegalactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick andvarying layers of interstellar dust. here we report that terzan 5, aglobular-cluster-like system in the galactic bulge, has two stellar populationswith different iron content and ages. terzan 5 could be the surviving remnantof one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and formgalaxy bulges.

1003.0280	the dynamical state of the globular cluster m10 (ngc 6254)	studying the radial variation of the stellar mass function in globularclusters (gcs) has proved a valuable tool to explore the collisional dynamicsleading to mass segregation and core collapse. in order to study the radialdependence of the luminosity and mass function of m 10, we used acs/hst deephigh resolution archival images, reaching out to approximately the cluster'shalf-mass radius (rhm), combined with deep wfpc2 images that extend our radialcoverage to more than 2 rhm. from our photometry, we derived a radial masssegregation profile and a global mass function that we compared with those ofsimulated clusters containing different energy sources (namely hard binariesand/or an imbh) able to halt core collapse and to quench mass segregation. aset of direct n-body simulations of gcs, with and without an imbh of mass 1% ofthe total cluster mass, comprising different initial mass functions (imfs) andprimordial binary fractions, was used to predict the observed mass segregationprofile and mass function. the mass segregation profile of m 10 is notcompatible with cluster models without either an imbh or primordial binaries,as a source of energy appears to be moderately quenching mass segregation inthe cluster. unfortunately, the present observational uncertainty on the binaryfraction in m10 does not allow us to confirm the presence of an imbh in thecluster, since an imbh, a dynamically non-negligible binary fraction (~ 5%), orboth can equally well explain the radial dependence of the cluster massfunction.

1012.2047	spectroscopy unveils the complex nature of terzan 5	we present the chemical abundance analysis of 33 red giant stars belonging tothe complex stellar system terzan 5. we confirm the discovery of two stellarpopulations (ferraro et al. 2009, nature, 462,483) with distinct ironabundances: a relatively metal-poor component with [fe/h]=-0.25 +/- 0.07r.m.s., and another component with [fe/h]=+0.27 +/- 0.04 r.m.s., exceeding inmetallicity any known galactic globular cluster. the two populations also showdifferent [alpha/fe] abundance ratios. the metal-poor component has an average[alpha/fe]=+0.34 +/- 0.06 r.m.s., consistent with the canonical scenario forrapid enrichment by core collapse supernovae (sne). the metal-rich componenthas [alpha/fe]=+0.03 +/-i 0.04 r.m.s., suggesting that the gas from which itformed was polluted by both type ii and type ia sne on a longer timescale.neither of the two populations shows evidence of the [al/fe] over [o/fe]anti-correlation, that is typically observed in galactic globular clusters.because these chemical abundance patterns are unique, we propose that terzan 5is not a true globular cluster, but a stellar system with a much more complexhistory of star formation and chemical enrichment.

1106.4909	the globular cluster ngc 2419: a crucible for theories of gravity	we present the analysis of a kinematic data set of stars in the globularcluster ngc 2419, taken with keck/deimos. combined with a reanalysis of deephst and subaru imaging data, which provide an accurate luminosity profile ofthe cluster, we investigate the validity of a large set of dynamical models ofthe system, which are checked for stability via n-body simulations. we findthat isotropic models in either newtonian or modified newtonian dynamics (mond)are ruled out with extremely high confidence. however, a simple michie model innewtonian gravity with anisotropic velocity dispersion provides an excellentrepresentation of the luminosity profile and kinematics. in contrast, with mondwe find that michie models that reproduce the luminosity profile eitherover-predict the velocity dispersion on the outskirts of the cluster if themass to light ratio is kept at astrophysically-motivated values, or else theyunder-predict the central velocity dispersion if the mass to light ratio istaken to be very small. we find that the best michie model in mond is a factorof 10000 less likely than the newtonian model that best fits the system. alikelihood ratio of 350 is found when we investigate more general models bysolving the jeans equation with a markov-chain monte carlo scheme. we verifiedwith n-body simulations that these results are not significantly different whenthe mond external field effect is accounted for. if the assumptions that thecluster is in dynamical equilibrium, spherical, not on a peculiar orbit, andpossesses a single dynamical tracer population of constant m/l are correct, weconclude that the present observations provide a very severe challenge formond.

1201.4959	the unimodal distribution of blue straggler stars in m75 (ngc 6864)	we have used a combination of multiband high-resolution and wide-fieldground-based observations to image the galactic globular cluster m75 (ngc6864). the extensive photometric sample covers the entire cluster extension,from the very central regions out to the tidal radius, allowing us to determinethe center of gravity and to construct the most extended star density profileever published for this cluster. we also present the first detailed star countsin the very inner regions. the star density profile is well re-produced by astandard king model with core radius r_c ~ 5.4" and intermediate-highconcentration c ~ 1.75. the present paper presents a detailed study of the bsspopulation and its radial distribution. a total number of 62 bright bsss (withm_f255w &lt; 21, corresponding to m_f555w &lt; 20) has been identified, and they havebeen found to be highly segregated in the cluster core. no significant upturnin the bss frequency has been observed in the outskirts of m75, in contrast toseveral other clusters studied with the same technique. this observational factis quite similar to what has been found in m79 (ngc 1904) by lanzoni et al.(2007a). indeed the bss radial distributions in the two clusters isqualitatively very similar, even if in m75 the relative bss frequency seems todecrease significantly faster than in m79: indeed it decreases by a factor of 5(from 3.4 to 0.7) within 1 r_c. such evidence indicate that the vast majorityof the cluster heavy stars (binaries) have already sunk to the core.

1202.1094	the bss population in ngc 6229	we have used a combination of high-resolution hubble space telescope wfpc2and wide-field ground-based observations in ultraviolet and optical bands tostudy the blue straggler star (bss) population of the outer-halo globularcluster ngc 6229, over its entire radial extent. a total of 64 bright bss (withm255 6 21.30, corresponding to m555 6 20.75) has been identified. the bssprojected radial distribution is found to be bimodal, with a high central peak,a well defined minimum at intermediate radii (r \sim 40"), and an upturn in theoutskirts. from detailed star counts even in the very inner region, we computethe centre of gravity of the cluster and the most accurate and extended radialdensity profile ever published for this system. the profile is reasonably wellreproduced by a standard king model with an extended core (rc \simeq 9.5") anda modest value of the concentration parameter (c \simeq 1.49). however, adeviation from the model is noted in the most external region of the cluster(at r &gt; 250" from the centre). this feature needs to be further investigated inorder to assess the possible presence of a tidal tail in this cluster.

1203.3024	the luminosity function and stellar mass to light ratio of the massive  globular cluster ngc2419	we used archival hubble space telescope wfc3 images to obtain the luminosityfunction of the remote globular cluster ngc2419 from two magnitudes above thehorizontal branch level down to \sim3.0 magnitudes below the turn off point (tom_i\sim6.4), approximately covering the range of initial stellar masses 0.5m_sun&lt;= m &lt;= 0.9 m_sun. the completeness-corrected luminosity function does notdisplay any change of shape over the radial range covered by the wfc3 data, outto ~6 core radii (r_c), or, equivalently, to ~2 half-light radii. theluminosity function in this radial range is also identical to that obtainedfrom ground based data at much larger distances from the cluster centre(12r_c&lt;= r&lt;= 22r_c), in the magnitude range in which the two distributionsoverlap (m_i&lt;= 4.0). these results support the conclusion by dalessandro et al.that there is no significant mass segregation among cluster stars, hence thestellar mass-to-light ratio remains constant with distance from the clustercentre. we fitted the observed luminosity function with theoreticalcounterparts with the proper age and metallicity from different sets of stellarevolution models and we consistently derive a total v band mass-to-light ratio1.2&lt;= m/l_v&lt;= 1.7, by extrapolating to the hydrogen burning limit, with abest-fit value m/l_v=1.5 +/- 0.1. on the other hand, assuming that there are nocluster stars with m&lt;= 0.3 m_sun, we establish a robust lower limit m/l_v&gt; 0.8.these estimates provide useful constraints for dynamical models of the clusterthat were forced to consider the stellar mass-to-light ratio as a (nearly) freeparameter.

1205.5561	chemical and kinematical properties of bsss and hb stars in ngc 6397	we used three sets of high-resolution spectra acquired with the multifiberfacility flames at the very large telescope of the european southernobservatory to investigate the chemical and kinematical properties of a sampleof 42 horizontal branch (hb) stars, 18 blue straggler stars (bsss) and 86 mainsequence turn-off and sub-giant branch stars in the nearby globular cluster ngc6397. we measured rotational velocities and fe, o and mg abundances. all theunevolved stars in our sample turn out to have low rotational velocites (v sini&lt; 10\kms), while hb stars and bsss show a broad distribution, with valuesranging from 0 to 70 \kms. for hb stars with t&lt;10500 k there is a cleartemperature-oxygen anti-correlation, that can be understood if the starposition along the hb is mainly determined by the he content. the hottest bsssand hb stars (with temperatures t&gt;8200 k and t&gt; 10500 k, respectively) alsoshow significant deviations in their iron abundance with respect to the clustermetallicity (as traced by the unevolved stars, [fe/h]=-2.12). while similarchemical patterns have been already observed in other hot hb stars, this is thefirst evidence ever collected for bsss. we interprete these abundance anomaliesas due to the metal radiative levitation, occurring in stars with shallow or noconvective envelopes.

1206.6515	the identification of the optical companion to the binary millisecond  pulsar j0610-2100 in the galactic field	we have used deep v and r images acquired at the eso very large telescope toidentify the optical companion to the binary pulsar psr j0610-2100, one of theblack-widow millisecond pulsars recently detected by the fermi gamma-raytelescope in the galactic plane. we found a faint star (v~26.7) nearlycoincident (\delta r ~0".28) with the pulsar nominal position. this star isvisible only in half of the available images, while it disappears in thedeepest ones (those acquired under the best seeing conditions), thus indicatingthat it is variable. although our observations do not sample the entire orbitalperiod (p=0.28 d) of the pulsar, we found that the optical modulation of thevariable star nicely correlates with the pulsar orbital period and describes awell defined peak (r~25.6) at \phi=0.75, suggesting a modulation due to thepulsar heating. we tentatively conclude that the companion to psr j0610-2100 isa heavily ablated very low mass star (~ 0.02msun) that completely filled itsroche lobe.

1208.0195	news from the galactic suburbia: the chemical composition of the remote  globular cluster ngc 2419	we present the chemical analysis of 49 giant stars of the globular clusterngc 2419, using medium resolution spectra collected with the multi-objectspectrograph deimos@keck. previous analysis of this cluster revealed a largedispersion in the line strength of the infrared ca ii triplet, suggesting anintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its fe or ca content. from our analysis, weassess that all the investigated stars share the same [fe/h], [ca/fe] and[ti/fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in mg and k abundances isdetected. the distribution of [mg/fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observedtargets having subsolar [mg/fe], down to [mg/fe] ~ -1 dex, a level ofmg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. it is found that thelarge dispersion in mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observeddispersion of the ca ii triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneouslyinterpreted in terms of fe or ca abundance scatter) because mg plays a relevantrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor. a strong depletionin the mg abundance leads to an increase of the line strength of the ca iitriplet, due to the variation in the electronic pressure, at a constant fe andca abundance. finally, we detect an anti-correlation between mg and kabundances, not easily explainable within the framework of the currentnucleosynthesis models.

1212.5071	dynamical age differences among coeval star clusters as revealed by blue  stragglers	globular star clusters that formed at the same cosmic time may have evolvedrather differently from a dynamical point of view (because that evolutiondepends on the internal environment) through a variety of processes that tendprogressively to segregate stars more massive than the average towards thecluster centre. therefore clusters with the same chronological age may havereached quite different stages of their dynamical history (that is, they mayhave different dynamical ages). blue straggler stars have masses greater thanthose at the turn-off point on the main sequence and therefore must be theresult of either a collision or a mass-transfer event. because they are amongthe most massive and luminous objects in old clusters, they can be used as testparticles with which to probe dynamical evolution. here we report that globularclusters can be grouped into a few distinct families on the basis of the radialdistribution of blue stragglers. this grouping corresponds well to an effectiveranking of the dynamical stage reached by stellar systems, thereby permitting adirect measure of the cluster dynamical age purely from observed properties.

0712.4272	blue straggler stars in the unusual globular cluster ngc 6388	we have used multi-band high resolution hst wfpc2 and acs observationscombined with wide field ground-based observations to study the blue stragglerstar (bss) population in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6388. as in severalother clusters we have studied, the bss distribution is found to be bimodal:highly peaked in the cluster center, rapidly decreasing at intermediate radii,and rising again at larger radii. in other clusters the sparsely populatedintermediate-radius region (or ``zone of avoidance'') corresponds well to thatpart of the cluster where dynamical friction would have caused the more massivebss or their binary progenitors to settle to the cluster center. instead, inngc 6388, bss still populate a region that should have been cleaned out bydynamical friction effects, thus suggesting that dynamical friction is somehowless efficient than expected. as by-product of these observations, the peculiarmorphology of the horizontal branch (hb) is also confirmed. in particular,within the (very extended) blue portion of the hb we are able to clearlycharacterize three sub-populations: ordinary blue hb stars, extreme hb stars,and blue hook stars. each of these populations has a radial distribution whichis indistinguishable from normal cluster stars.

1304.2953	the velocity dispersion profile of ngc 6388 from resolved-star  spectroscopy: no evidence of a central cusp and new constraints on the black  hole mass	by combining high spatial resolution and wide-field spectroscopy performed,respectively, with sinfoni and flames at the eso/vlt we measured the radialvelocities of more than 600 stars in the direction of ngc 6388, a galacticglobular cluster which is suspected to host an intermediate-mass black hole.approximately 55% of the observed targets turned out to be cluster members. thecluster velocity dispersion has been derived from the radial velocity ofindividual stars: 52 measurements in the innermost 2", and 276 stars locatedbetween 18" and 600". the velocity dispersion profile shows a central value of~13 km/s, a flat behavior out to ~60" and a decreasing trend outwards. thecomparison with spherical and isotropic models shows that the observed densityand velocity dispersion profiles are inconsistent with the presence of acentral black hole more massive than ~2000 msol. these findings are at oddswith recent results obtained from integrated light spectra, showing a velocitydispersion profile with a steep central cusp of 23-25 km/s at r&lt;2" andsuggesting the presence of a black hole with a mass of 17,000 msol (lutzgendorfet al. 2011). we also found some evidence of systemic rotation with amplitudearot ~8 km/s in the innermost 2" (0.13 pc), decreasing to arot= 3.2 km/s at18"&lt;r&lt;160".

1306.0839	flames and xshooter spectroscopy along the two bss sequences of m30	we present spectroscopic observations acquired with flames and xshooter atthe very large telescope for a sample of 15 blue straggler stars (bsss) in theglobular cluster (gc) m30. the targets have been selected to sample the two bsssequences discovered, with 7 bsss along the blue sequence and 8 along the redone. no difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of bsss hasbeen found. in particular, almost all the observed bsss have projectedrotational velocity lower than ~30 km/s, with only one (blue) fast rotating bss(&gt;90 km/s), identified as a w uma binary. this rotational velocity distributionis similar to those obtained in 47 tucanae and ngc 6397, while m4 remains theonly gc studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating bsss. allstars hotter than ~7800 k (regardless of the parent bss sequence) show ironabundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars, with aclearcut trend with the effective temperature. this behaviour suggests thatparticle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in thephotosphere of these stars, as already observed for the bsss in ngc 6397.finally, 4 bsss belonging to the red sequence (not affected by radiativelevitation) show a strong depletion of [o/fe], with respect to the abundancemeasured in red giant branch and horizontal branch stars. this o-depletion iscompatible with the chemical signature expected in bsss formed by mass transferprocesses in binary systems, in agreement with the mechanism proposed for theformation of bsss in the red sequence.

1307.6035	star count density profiles and structural parameters of 26 galactic  globular clusters	we used a proper combination of high-resolution hst observations andwide-field ground based data to derive the radial star density profile of 26galactic globular clusters from resolved star counts (which can be all freelydownloaded on-line). with respect to surface brightness (sb) profiles (whichcan be biased by the presence of sparse, bright stars), star counts areconsidered to be the most robust and reliable tool to derive cluster structuralparameters. for each system a detailed comparison with both king and wilsonmodels has been performed and the most relevant best-fit parameters have beenobtained. this is the largest homogeneous catalog collected so far of starcount profiles and structural parameters derived therefrom. the analysis of thedata of our catalog has shown that: (1) the presence of the central cuspspreviously detected in the sb profiles of ngc 1851, m13 and m62 is notconfirmed; (2) the majority of clusters in our sample are fitted equally wellby the king and the wilson models; (3) we confirm the known relationshipbetween cluster size (as measured by the effective radius) and galactocentricdistances; (4) the ratio between the core and the effective radii shows abimodal distribution, with a peak at ~ 0.3 for about 80% of the clusters, and asecondary peak at ~ 0.6 for the remaining 20%. interestingly, the main peakturns out to be in agreement with what expected from simulations of clusterdynamical evolution and the ratio between these two radii well correlates withan empirical dynamical age indicator recently defined from the observed shapeof blue straggler star radial distribution, thus suggesting that no exoticmechanisms of energy generation are needed in the cores of the analyzedclusters.

(2012). the estimated fraction of binariesis 6-7% in the central region (r&lt;90") and slightly lower (5.5%) in theoutskirts, at r&gt;200". quite interestingly, the comparison with the results ofmilone et al. (2012) suggests that also binary systems may display a bimodalradial distribution, with the position of the minimum consistent with that ofblue straggler stars. if confirmed, this feature would give additional supportto the scenario where the radial distribution of objects more massive than theaverage cluster stars is primarily shaped by the effect of dynamical friction.moreover, this would also be consistent with the idea that the unperturbedevolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant bss formation process inlow-density environments.

1310.2389	double blue straggler sequences in gcs: the case of ngc 362	we used high-quality images acquired with the wfc3 on board the hst to probethe blue straggler star (bss) population of the galactic globular cluster ngc362. we have found two distinct sequences of bss: this is the second case,after m 30, where such a feature has been observed. indeed the bss location,their extension in magnitude and color and their radial distribution within thecluster nicely resemble those observed in m 30, thus suggesting that the sameinterpretative scenario can be applied: the red bss sub-population is generatedby mass transfer binaries, the blue one by collisions. the discovery of fournew w uma stars, three of which lying along the red-bss sequence, furthersupports this scenario. we also found that the inner portion of the densityprofile deviates from a king model and is well reproduced by either a mildpower-law (\alpha -0.2) or a double king profile. this feature supports thehypothesis that the cluster is currently undergoing the core collapse phase.moreover, the bss radial distribution shows a central peak and monotonicallydecreases outward without any evidence of an external rising branch. thisevidence is a further indication of the advanced dynamical age of ngc 362: infact, together with m 30, ngc 362 belongs to the family of dynamically oldclusters (family iii) in the "dynamical clock" classification proposed byferraro et al. (2012). the observational evidence presented here strengthensthe possible connection between the existence of a double bss sequence and aquite advanced dynamical status of the parent cluster.

1311.1332	the wfpc2 uv survey: the bss population in ngc 5824	we have used a combination of high-resolution hubble space telescope wfpc2and wide-field ground-based observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, tostudy the blue straggler star population of the massive outer-halo globularcluster ngc 5824, over its entire radial extent. we have computed the center ofgravity of the cluster and constructed the radial density profile, fromdetailed star counts. the profile is well reproduced by a wilson model with asmall core (r_c \simeq 4.4 arcsec) and a concentration parameter c \simeq 2.74.we also present the first age determination for this cluster. from thecomparison with isochrones, we have found t=13\pm0.5 gyr. we discuss thisresult in the context of the observed age-metallicity relation of galacticglobular clusters. a total of 60 bright blue stragglers has been identified.their radial distribution is found to be bimodal, with a central peak, a welldefined minimum at r \sim 20 arcsec, and an upturn at large radii. in theframework of the dynamical clock defined by ferraro et al.

1312.0388	blue straggler masses from pulsation properties. i. the case of ngc6541	we used high-spatial resolution images acquired with the wfc3 on board hst toprobe the population of variable blue straggler stars in the central region ofthe poorly studied galactic globular cluster ngc 6541. the time sampling of theacquired multi wavelength (f390w, f555w and f814w) data allowed us to discoverthree wuma stars and nine sx phoenicis. periods, mean magnitudes and pulsationmodes have been derived for the nine sx phoenicis and their masses have beenestimated by using pulsation equations obtained from linear non adiabaticmodels. we found masses in the range 1.0-1.1mo, with an average value of1.06+-0.09 mo (sigma = 0.04), significantly in excess of the cluster mainsequence turn off mass (~ 0.75mo). a mild trend between mass and luminosityseems also to be present. the computed pulsation masses turn out to be in verygood agreement with the predictions of evolutionary tracks for single stars,indicating values in the range ~ 1.0-1.2 mo for most of the bss population, inagreement with what discussed in a number of previous studies.

1403.4096	an empirical mass-loss law for population ii giants from the  spitzer-irac survey of galactic globular clusters	the main aim of the present work is to derive an empirical mass-loss (ml) lawfor population ii stars in first and second ascent red giant branches. we usedthe spitzer infrared array camera (irac) photometry obtained in the 3.6-8micron range of a carefully chosen sample of 15 galactic globular clustersspanning the entire metallicity range and sampling the vast zoology ofhorizontal branch (hb) morphologies. we complemented the irac photometry withnear-infrared data to build suitable color-magnitude and color-color diagramsand identify mass-losing giant stars. we find that while the majority of starsshow colors typical of cool giants, some stars show an excess of mid-infraredlight that is larger than expected from their photospheric emission and that isplausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from them. for these stars, weestimate dust and total (gas + dust) ml rates and timescales. we finallycalibrate an empirical ml law for population ii red and asymptotic giant branchstars with varying metallicity. we find that at a given red giant branchluminosity only a fraction of the stars are losing mass. from this, we concludethat ml is episodic and is active only a fraction of the time, which we defineas the duty cycle. the fraction of mass-losing stars increases by increasingthe stellar luminosity and metallicity. the ml rate, as estimated fromreasonable assumptions for the gas-to-dust ratio and expansion velocity,depends on metallicity and slowly increases with decreasing metallicity. incontrast, the duty cycle increases with increasing metallicity, with the netresult that total ml increases moderately with increasing metallicity, about0.1 msun every dex in [fe/h]. for population ii asymptotic giant branch stars,we estimate a total ml of &lt;0.1 msun, nearly constant with varying metallicity.

1407.0047	chemical and kinematical properties of galactic bulge stars surrounding  the stellar system terzan 5	as part of a study aimed at determining the kinematical and chemicalproperties of terzan 5, we present the first characterization of the bulgestars surrounding this puzzling stellar system. we observed 615 targets locatedwell beyond the tidal radius of terzan 5 and we found that their radialvelocity distribution is well described by a gaussian function peaked at&lt;v_rad&gt;=+21.0\pm4.6 km/s and with dispersion sigma_v=113.0\pm2.7 km/s. this isthe one of the few high-precision spectroscopic survey of radial velocities fora large sample of bulge stars in such a low and positive latitude environment(b=+1.7{\deg}). we found no evidence for the peak at &lt;v_rad&gt;\sim+200 km/s foundin nidever et al. 2012. the strong contamination of many observed spectra bytio bands prevented us from deriving the iron abundance for the entirespectroscopic sample, introducing a selection bias. the metallicitydistribution was finally derived for a sub-sample of 112 stars in a magnituderange where the effect of the selection bias is negligible. the distribution isquite broad and roughly peaked at solar metallicity ([fe/h]\simeq+0.05 dex)with a similar number of stars in the super-solar and in the sub-solar ranges.the population number ratios in different metallicity ranges agree well withthose observed in other low-latitude bulge fields suggesting (i) the possiblepresence of a plateau for |b|&lt;4{\deg} for the ratio between stars in thesuper-solar (0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0.5 dex) and sub-solar (-0.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0 dex) metallicityranges; (ii) a severe drop of the metal-poor component ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5) as afunction of galactic latitude.

1409.1682	ceci n'est pas a globular cluster: the metallicity distribution of the  stellar system terzan 5	we present new determinations of the iron abundance for 220 stars belongingto the stellar system terzan 5 in the galactic bulge. the spectra have beenacquired with flames at the very large telescope of the european southernobservatory and deimos at the keck ii telescope. this is by far the largestspectroscopic sample of stars ever observed in this stellar system. from thisdataset, a subsample of targets with spectra unaffected by tio bands wasextracted and statistically decontaminated from field stars. once combined with34 additional stars previously published by our group, a total sample of 135member stars covering the entire radial extent of the system has been used todetermine the metallicity distribution function of terzan 5. the irondistribution clearly shows three peaks: a super-solar component at[fe/h]$\simeq0.25$ dex, accounting for 29% of the sample, a dominant sub-solarpopulation at [fe/h]$\simeq-0.30$ dex, corresponding to 62% of the total, and aminor (6%) metal-poor component at [fe/h]$\simeq-0.8$ dex. such a broad,multi-modal metallicity distribution demonstrates that terzan 5 is not agenuine globular cluster but the remnant of a much more complex stellar system.

1410.2275	spinning like a blue straggler: the population of fast rotating blue  straggler stars in omega centauri	by using high-resolution spectra acquired with flames-giraffe at the eso/vlt,we measured radial and rotational velocities for 110 blue straggler stars(bsss) in omega centauri, the globular cluster-like stellar system harboringthe largest known bss population. according to their radial velocities, 109bsss are members of the system. the rotational velocity distribution is verybroad, with the bulk of bsss spinning at less than ~40 km/s (in agreement withthe majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tailreaching ~200 km/s. about 40% of the sample has vsini &gt;40 km/s and about 20%has vsini &gt;70 km/s. such a large fraction is very similar to the percentage ofof fast rotating bsss observed in m4. thus, omega centauri is the secondstellar cluster, beyond m4, with a surprisingly high population of fastspinning bsss. we found a hint of a radial behaviour of the fraction of fastrotating bsss, with a mild peak within one core radius, and a possibile rise inthe external regions (beyond four core radii). this may suggest that recentformation episodes of mass transfer bsss occurred preferentially in theoutskirts of omega centauri, or that braking mechanisms able to slow down thesestars are least efficient in lowest density environments.

1411.2161	probing the role of dynamical friction in shaping the bss radial  distribution. i - semi-analytical models and preliminary n-body simulations	we present semi-analytical models and simplified $n$-body simulations with$10^4$ and $10^5$ particles aimed at probing the role of dynamical friction(df) in determining the radial distribution of blue straggler stars (bsss) inglobular clusters. the semi-analytical models show that df (which is the onlyevolutionary mechanism at work) is responsible for the formation of a bimodaldistribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of thecluster. however, these models fail to reproduce the formation of thelong-lived central peak observed in all dynamically evolved clusters. theresults of $n$-body simulations confirm the formation of a sharp central peak,which remains as a stable feature over the time regardless of the initialconcentration of the system. in spite of a noisy behavior, a bimodaldistribution forms in many cases, with the size of the dip increasing as afunction of time. in the most advanced stages the distribution becomesmonotonic. these results are in agreement with the observations. also the shapeof the peak and the location of the minimum (which in most of the cases iswithin 10 core radii) turn out to be consistent with observational results. fora more detailed and close comparison with observations, including a propercalibration of the timescales of the dynamical processes driving the evolutionof the bss spatial distribution, more realistic simulations will be necessary.

1501.01358	the binary mass transfer origin of the red blue straggler sequence in  m30	two separated sequences of blue straggler stars (bsss) have been revealed byferraro et al. (2009) in the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of the milky wayglobular cluster m30. their presence has been suggested to be related to thetwo bss formation channels (namely, collisions and mass-transfer in closebinaries) operating within the same stellar system. the blue sequence wasindeed found to be well reproduced by collisional bss models. in contrast, nospecific models for mass transfer bsss were available for an old stellar systemlike m30. here we present binary evolution models, including case-b masstransfer and binary merging, specifically calculated for this cluster. wediscuss in detail the evolutionary track of a $0.9+0.5 m_\odot$ binary, whichspends approximately 4 gyr in the bss region of the cmd of a 13 gyr oldcluster. we also run monte-carlo simulations to study the distribution of masstransfer bsss in the cmd and to compare it with the observational data. ourresults show that: (1) the color and magnitude distribution of synthetic masstransfer bsss defines a strip in the cmd that nicely matches the observed redbss sequence, thus providing strong support to the mass transfer origin forthese stars; (2) the cmd distribution of synthetic bsss never attains theobserved location of the blue bss sequence, thus reinforcing the hypothesisthat the latter formed through a different channel (likely collisions); (3)most ($\sim 60\%$) of the synthetic bsss are produced by mass-transfer models,while the remaining $&lt; 40\%$ requires the contribution from merger models.

1509.08917	chemical analysis of asymptotic giant branch stars in m62	we have collected uves-flames high-resolution spectra for a sample of 6asymptotic giant branch (agb) and 13 red giant branch (rgb) stars in thegalactic globular cluster m62 (ngc6266). here we present the detailed abundanceanalysis of iron, titanium, and light-elements (o, na, al and mg). for themajority (5 out 6) of the agb targets we find that the abundances, of both ironand titanium, determined from neutral lines are significantly underestimatedwith respect to those obtained from ionized features, the latter being,instead, in agreement with those measured for the rgb targets. this is similarto recent findings in other clusters and may suggest the presence of non-localthermodynamical equilibrium (nlte) effects. in the o-na, al-mg and na-alplanes, the rgb stars show the typical correlations observed for globularcluster stars. instead, all the agb targets are clumped in the regions wherefirst generation stars are expected to lie, similarly to what recently foundfor the agb population of ngc6752. while the sodium and aluminum abundancecould be underestimated as a consequence of the nlte bias affecting iron andtitanium, the used oxygen line does not suffer from the same effects and thelack of o-poor agb stars therefore is solid. we can thus conclude that none ofthe investigated agb stars belong to the second stellar generation of m62. wealso find a rgb star with extremely high sodium abundance ([na/fe] = +1.08dex).

1510.01468	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. v. constraints on formation scenarios	we build on the evidence provided by our legacy survey of galactic globularclusters (gc) to submit to a crucial test four scenarios currently entertainedfor the formation of multiple stellar generations in gcs. the observationalconstraints on multiple generations to be fulfilled are manifold, including gcspecificity, ubiquity, variety, predominance, discreteness, supernovaavoidance, p-capture processing, helium enrichment and mass budget. we arguethat scenarios appealing to supermassive stars, fast rotating massive stars andmassive interactive binaries violate in an irreparable fashion two or moreamong such constraints. also the scenario appealing to agb stars as producersof the material for next generation stars encounters severe difficulties,specifically concerning the mass budget problem and the detailed chemicalcomposition of second generation stars. we qualitatively explore ways possiblyallowing one to save the agb scenario, specifically appealing to a possiblerevision of the cross section of a critical reaction rate destroying sodium, oralternatively by a more extensive exploration of the vast parameter spacecontrolling the evolutionary behavior of agb stellar models. still, we cannotensure success for these efforts and totally new scenarios may have to beinvented to understand how gcs formed in the early universe.

1510.06870	giano-tng spectroscopy of red supergiants in the young star cluster  rsgc3	the scutum complex in the inner disk of the galaxy has a number of young starclusters dominated by red supergiants that are heavily obscured by dustextinction and observable only at infrared wavelengths. these clusters areimportant tracers of the recent star formation and chemical enrichment historyin the inner galaxy. during the technical commissioning and as a first scienceverification of the giano spectrograph at the telescopio nazionale galileo, wesecured high-resolution (r=50,000) near-infrared spectra of five redsupergiants in the young scutum cluster rsgc3. taking advantage of the fullyjhk spectral coverage of giano in a single exposure, we were able to measureseveral tens of atomic and molecular lines that were suitable for determiningchemical abundances. by means of spectral synthesis and line equivalent widthmeasurements, we obtained abundances of fe and iron-peak elements such as ni,cr, and cu, alpha (o, mg, si, ca, ti), other light elements (c, n, f, na, al,and sc), and some s-process elements (y, sr). we found average half-solar ironabundances and solar-scaled [x/fe] abundance patterns for most of the elements,consistent with a thin-disk chemistry. we found depletion of [c/fe] andenhancement of [n/fe], consistent with standard cn burning, and low 12c/13cabundance ratios (between 9 and 11), which require extra-mixing processes inthe stellar interiors during the post-main sequence evolution. we also foundlocal standard of rest v(lsr)=106 km/s and heliocentric v(hel)=90 km/s radialvelocities with a dispersion of 2.3 km/s. the inferred radial velocities,abundances, and abundance patterns of rsgc3 are very similar to thosepreviously measured in the other two young clusters of the scutum complex,rsgc1 and rsgc2, suggesting a common kinematics and chemistry within the scutumcomplex.

1512.00649	weighing stars: the identification of an evolved blue straggler star in  the globular cluster 47 tucanae	globular clusters are known to host peculiar objects, named blue stragglerstars (bsss), significantly heavier than the normal stellar population. whilethese stars can be easily identified during their core hydrogen-burning phase,they are photometrically indistinguishable from their low-mass sisters inadvanced stages of the subsequent evolution. a clear-cut identification ofthese objects would require the direct measurement of the stellar mass. we usedthe detailed comparison between chemical abundances derived from neutral andfrom ionized spectral lines as a powerful stellar "weighing device" to measurestellar mass and to identify an evolved bss in 47 tucanae. in particular,high-resolution spectra of three bright stars located slightly above the levelof the "canonical" horizontal branch sequence in the color-magnitude diagram of47 tucanae, have been obtained with uves spectrograph. the measurements of ironand titanium abundances performed separately from neutral and ionized linesreveal that two targets have stellar parameters fully consistent with thoseexpected for low-mass post-horizontal branch objects, while for the othertarget the elemental ionization balance is obtained only by assuming a mass of~1.4msol, which is significantly larger than the main sequence turn-off mass ofthe cluster (~0.85 msol). the comparison with theoretical stellar trackssuggests that this is a bss descendant possibly experiencing its corehelium-burning phase. the large applicability of the proposed method to most ofthe globular clusters in our galaxy opens the possibility to initiatesystematic searches for evolved bsss, thus giving access to still unexploredphases of their evolution.

0807.0105	the nucleus of the sagittarius dsph galaxy and m54: a window on the  process of galaxy nucleation	we present the results of a thorough study of the nucleus of the sgr dwarfspheroidal galaxy and of the bright globular cluster m54 that resides withinthe same nucleus (sgr,n). we have obtained accurate radial velocities andmetallicity estimates for 1152 candidate red giant branch stars of sgr and m54lying within ~ 9 arcmin from the center of the galaxy, from keck/deimos andvlt/flames spectra of the infrared calcium ii triplet. using both velocity andmetallicity information we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very-likelymembers of m54 and of sgr,n, respectively. the two considered systems displaysignificantly different velocity dispersion profiles: m54 has a steeplydecreasing profile from r=0, where sigma= 14.2 km/s, to r=3.5 arcmin where itreaches sigma=5.3 km/s, then it appears to rise again to sigma= 10 km/s at r=7arcmin. in contrast sgr,n has a uniformly flat profile at sigma=9.6 km/s overthe whole 0 &lt; r &lt; 9 arcmin range. using data from the literature we show thatthe velocity dispersion of sgr remains constant at least out to r ~ 100 arcminand there is no sign of the transition between the outerflat-luminosity-profile core and the inner nucleus in the velocity profile.these results - together with a re-analysis of the surface brightness profileof sgr,n and a suite of dedicated n-body simulations - provide very strongsupport for the hypothesis that the nucleus of sgr formed independently of m54,which probably plunged to its present position, coincident with sgr,n, becauseof significant decay of the original orbit due to dynamical friction.
