0905.2161	star formation in the central 400 pc of the milky way: evidence for a  population of massive ysos	the central kpc of the milky way might be expected to differ significantlyfrom the rest of the galaxy with regard to gas dynamics and the formation ofysos. we probe this possibility with mid-infrared observations obtained withirac and mips on spitzer and with msx. we use color-color diagrams and sed fitsto explore the nature of yso candidates (including objects with 4.5 micronexcesses possibly due to molecular emission). there is an asymmetry in thedistribution of the candidate ysos, which tend to be found at negative galacticlongitudes; this behavior contrasts with that of the molecular gas,approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes. the small scale height ofthese objects suggests that they are within the galactic center region and aredynamically young. they lie between two layers of infrared dark clouds and mayhave originated from these clouds. we identify new sites for this recent starformation. the methanol masers appear to be associated with young, embeddedysos characterized by 4.5 micron excesses. we use the seds of these sources toestimate their physical characteristics. within the central 400x50 pc(|l|&lt;1.3\degr and |b|&lt;10') the star formation rate based on the identificationof stage i evolutionary phase of yso candidates is about 0.14 solar mass/yr. wesuggest that a recent burst of star formation took place within the last 10^5years. this suggestion is also consistent with estimates of star formationrates within the last ~10^7 years showing a peak around 10^5 years ago. lastly,we find that the schmidt-kennicutt law applies well in the central 400 pc ofthe galaxy. this implies that star formation does not appear to be dramaticallyaffected by the extreme physical conditions in the galactic center region.

0906.5276	too large and overlooked? extended free-free emission towards massive  star formation regions	we present australia telescope compact array observations towards 6 massivestar formation regions which, from their strong 24 ghz continuum emission butno compact 8 ghz continuum emission, appeared good candidates for hyper-compacthii regions. however, the properties of the ionised gas derived from the 19 to93 ghz continuum emission and h70 alpha + h57 alpha radio recombination linedata show the majority of these sources are, in fact, regions ofspatially-extended, optically-thin free-free emission. these extended sourceswere missed in the previous 8 ghz observations due to a combination ofspatial-filtering, poor surface brightness sensitivity and primary beamattenuation.  we consider the implications that a significant number of these extended hiiregions may have been missed by previous surveys of massive star formationregions. if the original sample of 21 sources is representative of thepopulation as a whole, the fact that 6 contain previously undetected extendedfree-free emission suggests a large number of regions have been mis-classified.rather than being very young objects prior to uchii region formation, they are,in fact, associated with extended hii regions and thus significantly older. inaddition, inadvertently ignoring a potentially substantial flux contribution(up to ~0.5jy) from free-free emission has implications for dust masses derivedfrom sub-mm flux densities. the large spatial scales probed by single-dishtelescopes, which do not suffer from spatial filtering, are particularlysusceptible and dust masses may be overestimated by up to a factor of ~2.

0909.1223	multi-generation massive star-formation in ngc3576	recent 1.2-mm continuum observations have shown the giant hii region ngc3576to be embedded in the centre of an extended filamentary dust-cloud. the bulk ofthe filament away from the hii region contains a number of clumps seen only at(sub-)millimetre wavelengths and which may host massive protostellar objects ata very early stage of evolution. we have used the australia telescope compactarray (atca) to image the cloud for the nh3(1,1), (2,2) and (4,4) transitions,22 ghz water masers, and 23 ghz continuum emission. we also utilised the 22-mmopra antenna to map the region for the molecular lines 13co (1-0), c18o (1-0),hco+ (1-0), h13co+ (1-0), cs (1-0) and n2h+ (1-0).the hii region is observed tobe expanding into the molecular cloud, sweeping up a clumpy shell of gas, whilethe central star cluster is dispersing the molecular gas to the east.temperatures are highest adjacent to the central hii region, indicating thatthe embedded cluster of young stars there is heating the gas. six new watermasers were detected in the arms of the filament, all associated with nh3emission peaks, confirming that star-formation has begun within these cores.core masses range from 5 to 516 solar masses and most appear to begravitationally bound. complementary results by andr\'e et al. (2008) implythat seven cores will go on to form massive stars between 15 and 50 solarmasses. the large scale velocity structure of the filament is smooth, but atleast one clump shows the signature of inward gas motions via asymmetries inthe nh3 (1,1) line profiles. the same clump exhibits an enhanced abundance ofn2h+, which coupled with an absence of co indicates depletion onto the dustgrain surface. the hii region at the heart of ngc3576 is potentially triggeringthe formation of massive stars in the bulk of the associated cloud.

0707.1399	detection of sio emission from a massive dense cold core	we report the detection of the sio (j = 2 - 1) transition from the massivecold dense core g333.125-0.562. the core remains undetected at wavelengthsshorter than 70 micron and has compact 1.2 mm dust continuum. the sio emissionis localised to the core. the observations are part of a continuingmulti-molecular line survey of the giant molecular cloud g333. other detectedmolecules in the core include 13co, c18o, cs, hco+, hcn, hnc, ch3oh, n2h+, so,hc3n, nh3, and some of their isotopes. in addition, from nh3 (1,1) and (2,2)inversion lines, we obtain a temperature of 13 k. from fitting to the spectralenergy distribution we obtain a colour temperature of 18 k and a gas mass of 2x 10^3 solar mass. we have also detected a 22 ghz water maser in the core,together with methanol maser emission, suggesting the core will host massivestar formation. we hypothesise that the sio emission arises from shocksassociated with an outflow in the cold core.

1002.2475	the 6-ghz methanol multibeam maser catalogue i: galactic centre region,  longitudes 345 to 6	we have conducted a galactic plane survey of methanol masers at 6668 mhzusing a 7-beam receiver on the parkes telescope. here we present results fromthe first part, which provides sensitive unbiased coverage of a large regionaround the galactic centre. details are given for 183 methanol maser sites inthe longitude range 345$^{\circ}$ through the galactic centre to 6$^{\circ}$.within 6$^{\circ}$ of the centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more thanhalf (48) are new discoveries. the masers are confined to a narrow galacticlatitude range, indicative of many sources at the galactic centre distance andbeyond, and confined to a thin disk population; there is no high latitudepopulation that might be ascribed to the galactic bulge.  within 2$^{\circ}$ of the galactic centre the maser velocities all liebetween -60 and +77 \kms, a range much smaller than the 540 \kms range observedin co. elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107 \kms) occurs,surprisingly, near longitude 355$^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to thegalactic bar. the maser with the most negative velocity (-127 \kms) is nearlongitude 346$^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near sideof the `3-kpc arm'. it has the most extreme velocity of a clear population ofmasers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. closer to thegalactic centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25kpc of the centre itself, the `galactic centre zone', where it is 50 timeshigher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by theunusual velocities.

1005.5036	characterisation of the mopra radio telescope at 16--50 ghz	we present the results of a programme of scanning and mapping observations ofastronomical masers and jupiter designed to characterise the performance of themopra radio telescope at frequencies between 16-50 ghz using the 12-mm and 7-mmreceivers. we use these observations to determine the telescope beam size, beamshape and overall telescope beam efficiency as a function of frequency. we findthat the beam size is well fit by $\lambda$/$d$ over the frequency range with acorrelation coefficient of ~90%. we determine the telescope main beamefficiencies are between ~48-64% for the 12-mm receiver and reasonably flat at~50% for the 7-mm receiver. beam maps of strong h$_2$o (22 ghz) and sio masers(43 ghz) provide a means to examine the radial beam pattern of the telescope.at both frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the presence of threecomponents, a central `core', which is well fit by a gaussian and constitutesthe telescopes main beam, and inner and outer error beams. at both frequenciesthe inner and outer error beams extend out to approximately 2 and 3.4 times thefull-width half maximum of the main beam respectively. sources with angularsizes a factor of two or more larger than the telescope main beam will coupleto the main and error beams, and therefore the power contributed by the errorbeams needs to be considered. from measurements of the radial beam powerpattern we estimate the amount of power contained in the inner and outer errorbeams is of order one-fifth at 22 ghz rising slightly to one-third at 43 ghz.

1009.4745	12mm line survey of the dense molecular gas towards the w28 field tev  gamma-ray sources	we present 12mm mopra observations of dense molecular gas towards the w28supernova remnant (snr) field. the focus is on the dense molecular gas towardsthe tev gamma-ray sources detected by the h.e.s.s. telescopes, which likelytrace the cosmic-rays from w28 and possibly other sources in the region. usingthe nh3 inversion transitions we reveal several dense cores inside themolecular clouds, the majority of which coincide with high-mass star formationand hii regions, including the energetic ultra-compact hii region g5.89-0.39. akey exception to this is the cloud north east of w28, which is well-known to bedisrupted as evidenced by clusters of 1720mhz oh masers and broad co lineemission. here we detect broad nh3, up to the (9,9) transition, with linewidthsup to 16 km/s. this broad nh3 emission spatially matches well with the tevsource hess j1801-233 and co emission, and its velocity dispersion distributionsuggests external disruption from the w28 snr direction. other lines aredetected, such as hc3n and hc5n, h2o masers, and many radio recombinationlines, all of which are primarily found towards the southern high-mass starformation regions. these observations provide a new view onto the internalstructures and dynamics of the dense molecular gas towards the w28 snr field,and in tandem with future higher resolution tev gamma-ray observations willoffer the chance to probe the transport of cosmic-rays into molecular clouds.

0711.4399	determining the relative evolutionary stages of very young massive star  formation regions	we have recently completed an observing program with the australia telescopecompact array towards massive star formation regions traced by 6.7 ghz methanolmaser emission. we found the molecular cores could be separated into groupsbased on their association with/without methanol maser and 24 ghz continuumemission. analysis of the molecular and ionised gas properties suggested thecores within the groups may be at different evolutionary stages. in thiscontribution we derive the column densities and temperatures of the cores fromthe nh3 emission and investigate if this can be used as an indicator of therelative evolutionary stages of cores in the sample.  the majority of cores are well fit using single-temperature large velocitygradient models, and exhibit a range of temperatures from ~10 k to &gt;200 k.under the simple but reasonable assumption that molecular gas in the cores willheat up and become less quiescent with age due to feedback from the poweringsource(s), the molecular gas kinetic temperature combined with information ofthe core kinematics seems a promising probe of relative core age in theearliest evolutionary stages of massive star formation.

1304.7076	spectral imaging of the central molecular zone in multiple 7-mm  molecular lines	we have imaged 24 spectral lines in the central molecular zone (cmz) aroundthe galactic centre, in the range 42 to 50 ghz. the lines include emission fromthe cs, ch3oh, hc3n, sio, hnco, hoco+, nh2cho, ocs, hcs+, ccs, c34s, 13cs,29sio, h13cccn, hcc13cn and hc5}n molecules, and three hydrogen recombinationlines. the area covered is galactic longitude -0.7 to 1.8 deg. and latitude-0.3 to 0.2 deg., including the bright cores around sgr a, sgrb2, sgrc andg1.6-0.025. this work used the 22-m mopra radio telescope in australia,obtaining ~ 1.8 km/s spectral and ~ 65 arcsec spatial resolution. we presentpeak images from this study and conduct a principal component analysis on theintegrated emission from the brightest 10 lines, to study similarities anddifferences in the line distribution. we examine the integrated lineintensities and line ratios in selected apertures around the bright cores, aswell as for the complete mapped region of the cmz. we compare these 7-mm linesto the corresponding lines in the 3-mm band, for five molecules, to study theexcitation. there is a variation in 3-mm to 7-mm line ratio across the cmz,with relatively higher ratio in the centre around sgr b2 and sgr a. we findthat the lines are sub-thermally excited, and from modelling with radex findthat non-lte conditions apply, with densities of order 10^4 cm^{-3}.

0802.2298	molecular line mapping of the giant molecular cloud associated with rcw  106 - ii. column density and dynamical state of the clumps	we present a fully sampled c^{18}o (1-0) map towards the southern giantmolecular cloud (gmc) associated with the hii region rcw 106, and use it incombination with previous ^{13}co (1-0) mapping to estimate the gas columndensity as a function of position and velocity. we find localized regions ofsignificant ^{13}co optical depth in the northern part of the cloud, withseveral of the high-opacity clouds in this region likely associated with alimb-brightened shell around the hii region g333.6-0.2. optical depthcorrections broaden the distribution of column densities in the cloud, yieldinga log-normal distribution as predicted by simulations of turbulence.decomposing the ^{13}co and c^{18}o data cubes into clumps, we find relativelyweak correlations between size and linewidth, and a more sensitive dependenceof luminosity on size than would be predicted by a constant average columndensity. the clump mass spectrum has a slope near -1.7, consistent withprevious studies. the most massive clumps appear to have gravitational bindingenergies well in excess of virial equilibrium; we discuss possibleexplanations, which include magnetic support and neglect of time-varyingsurface terms in the virial theorem. unlike molecular clouds as a whole, theclumps within the rcw 106 gmc, while elongated, appear to show randomorientations with respect to the galactic plane.

0803.1329	cyanopolyynes and sulphur bearing species in hot cores: chemical and  line excitation models	we present results from a time dependent gas phase chemical model of a hotcore based on the physical conditions of g305.2+0.2. while the cyanopolyynehc_3n has been observed in hot cores, the longer chained species, hc_5n, hc_7n,and hc_9n have not been considered typical hot core species. we present resultswhich show that these species can be formed under hot core conditions. wediscuss the important chemical reactions in this process and, in particular,show that their abundances are linked to the parent species acetylene which isevaporated from icy grain mantles. the cyanopolyynes show promise as `chemicalclocks' which may aid future observations in determining the age of hot coresources. the abundance of the larger cyanopolyynes increase and decrease overrelatively short time scales, ~10^2.5 years. we also discuss several sulphurbearing species. we present results from a non-lte statistical equilibriumexcitation model as a series of density, temperature and column densitydependent contour plots which show both the line intensities and several lineratios. these aid in the interpretation of spectral line data, even when thereis limited line information available.

1407.6042	methanol maser associated outflows: detection statistics and properties	we have selected the positions of 54 6.7ghz methanol masers from the methanolmultibeam survey catalogue, covering a range of longitudes between $20^{\circ}$and $34^{\circ}$ of the galactic plane. these positions were mapped in thej=3-2 transition of both the $\rm{^{13}co}$ and $\rm{c^{18}o}$ lines. a totalof 58 $\rm{^{13}co}$ emission peaks are found in the vicinity of these maserpositions. we search for outflows around all $\rm{^{13}co}$ peaks, and findevidence for high-velocity gas in all cases, spatially resolving the red andblue outflow lobes in 55 cases. of these sources, 44 have resolved kinematicdistances, and are closely associated with the 6.7ghz masers, a sub-setreferred to as methanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we calculate themasses of the clumps associated with each peak using 870 $\rm{\mu m}$ continuumemission from the atlasgal survey. a strong correlation is seen between theclump mass and both outflow mass and mechanical force, lending support tomodels in which accretion is strongly linked to outflow. we find that thescaling law between outflow activity and clump masses observed for low-massobjects, is also followed by the mmaos in this study, indicating a commonalityin the formation processes of low-mass and high-mass stars.

1501.06589	6.7ghz methanol maser associated outflows: an evolutionary sequence	we present a continuing study of a sample 44 molecular outflows, observed in13co lines, closely associated with 6.7ghz methanol masers, hence calledmethanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we compare mmao properties withthose of outflows from other surveys in the literature. in general, mmaosfollow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta,with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. asimilar trend is seen for the dynamical timescales of mmaos. we argue that thelack of relatively low mass and young flows in mmaos is due to the inherentselection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7ghz methanolmasers. this implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset ofoutflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanolis liberated from icy dust mantles. consequently the average dynamical age ofmmaos is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. wepropose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence inthe hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of theoutflow phase.

astro-ph;0010154	unlocking the keyhole - h2 and pah emission from molecular clumps in the  keyhole nebula	to better understand the environment surrounding co emission clumps in thekeyhole nebula, we have made images of the region in h2 1-0 s(1) (2.122 um)emission and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission at 3.29 um. ourresults show that the h2 and pah emission regions are morphologically similar,existing as several clumps, all of which correspond to co emission clumps anddark optical features. the emission confirms the existence of photodissociationregions (pdrs) on the surface of the clumps. by comparing the velocity range ofthe co emission with the optical appearance of the h2 and pah emission, wepresent a model of the keyhole nebula in which the most negative velocityclumps are in front of the ionization region, the clumps at intermediatevelocities are in it, and those which have the least negative velocities are atthe far side. it may be that these clumps, which appear to have been swept upfrom molecular gas by the stellar winds from eta car, are now being over-run bythe ionization region and forming pdrs on their surfaces. these clumps comprisethe last remnants of the ambient molecular cloud around eta car.

astro-ph;0111318	photodissociation regions and star formation in the carina nebula	we have obtained wide-field thermal infrared (ir) images of the carinanebula, using the spirex/abu telescope at the south pole. emission frompoly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) at 3.29um, a tracer ofphotodissociation regions (pdrs), reveals many interesting well defined clumpsand diffuse regions throughout the complex. near-ir images (1--2um), along withimages from the midcourse space experiment (msx) satellite (8--21um) wereincorporated to study the interactions between the young stars and thesurrounding molecular cloud in more detail. two new pah emission clumps havebeen identified in the keyhole nebula and were mapped in 12co(2--1) and (1--0)using the sest. analysis of their physical properties reveals they are densemolecular clumps, externally heated with pdrs on their surfaces and supportedby external pressure in a similar manner to the other clumps in the region. apreviously identified externally heated globule containing iras 10430-5931 inthe southern molecular cloud, shows strong 3.29-, 8- and 21-um emission, thespectral energy distribution (sed) revealing the location of an ultra-compact(uc) hii region. the northern part of the nebula is complicated, with pahemission inter-mixed with mid-ir dust continuum emission. several point sourcesare located here and through a two-component black-body fit to their seds, wehave identified 3 possible uc hii regions as well as a young star surrounded bya circumstellar disc. this implies that star formation in this region ison-going and not halted by the intense radiation from the surrounding youngmassive stars.

astro-ph;0112174	formation pumping of molecular hydrogen in the messier 17  photodissociation region	we have imaged the emission from the near-infrared v=1-0 s(1), 1-0 s(7), 2-1s(1) and 6-4 o(3) lines of molecular hydrogen in the n- and sw-bars of m17,together with the hydrogen br-gamma and br-10 lines. this includes the firstemission line image ever to be obtained of a line from the highly excited v=6level of h2. in both bars, the h2 emission is generally distributed in clumpsalong filamentary features. the 1-0 s(1) and 2-1 s(1) images have similarmorphologies. together with their relative line ratios, this supports afluorescent origin for their emission, within a photodissociation region. thesw-bar contains a clumpy medium, but in the n-bar the density is roughlyconstant. the 1-0 s(7) line image is also similar to the 1-0 s(1) image, butthe 6-4 o(3) image is significantly different to it. since the emissionwavelengths of these two lines are similar (1.748 to 1.733um), this cannot bedue to differential extinction between the v=6 and the v=1 lines. we attributethe difference to the pumping of newly formed h2 into the v=6, or to a nearby,level. however, this also requires either a time-dependent photodissociationregion (where molecule formation does not balance dissociation), rather than itto be in steady-state, and/or for the formation spectrum to vary with positionin the source. if this interpretation of formation pumping of molecularhydrogen is correct, it is the first clear signature from this process to beseen.

astro-ph;0512589	a ch3cn and hco+ survey towards southern methanol masers associated with  star formation	we present the initial results of a 3-mm spectral line survey towards 83methanol maser selected massive star-forming regions. here we reportobservations of the j=5-4 and 6-5 rotational transitions of methyl cyanide(ch3cn) and the j=1-0 transition of hco+and h13co+.  ch3cn emission is detected in 58 sources (70 %) of our sample). we estimatethe temperature and column density for 37 of these using the rotational diagrammethod. the temperatures we derive range from 28-166 k, and are lower thanpreviously reported temperatures, derived from higher j transitions. we findthat ch3cn is brighter and more commonly detected towards ultra-compact hii(uchii) regions than towards isolated maser sources. detection of ch3cn towardsisolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internallyheated and that ch3cn is excited prior to the uchii phase of massivestar-formation.  hco+ is detected towards 82 sources (99 % of our sample), many of whichexhibit asymmetric line profiles compared to h13co+. skewed profiles areindicative of inward or outward motions, however, we find approximately equalnumbers of red and blue-skewed profiles among all classes. column densities arederived from an analysis of the hco+ and h13co+ line profiles.  80 sources have mid-infrared counterparts: 68 seen in emission and 12 seen inabsorption as `dark clouds'. seven of the twelve dark clouds exhibit asymmetrichco+ profiles, six of which are skewed to the blue, indicating infallingmotions. ch3cn is also common in dark clouds, where it has a 90 % detectionrate.

astro-ph;0602294	millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation  regions ii. scuba observations of cold cores and the dust grain emissivity  index $\beta$	we report the results of a submillimetre continuum emission survey targetedtoward 78 star formation regions, 72 of which are devoid of methanol maser anduc hii regions, identified in the sest/simba millimetre continuum survey ofhill et al. (2005). at least 45 per cent of the latter sources, dubbed`mm-only', detected in this survey are also devoid of mid infrared msx,emission. the 450 and 850micron, continuum emission was mapped using thesubmillimetre common user bolometer array (scuba) instrument on the james clerkmaxwell telescope (jcmt). emission is detected toward 97 per cent of the 78sources targeted as well as towards 28 other simba sources lying in the scubafields.  we concatenate the results from four (sub)millimetre continuum surveys ofmassive star formation [walsh et al. (2003), hill et al. (2005), thompson etal. (2006); as well as this work], together with the galactic plane map ofpierce-price et al. (2000) in order to determine the dust grain emissivityindex $\beta$ for each of the sources in the simba source list. we examine thevalue of $\beta$ with respect to temperature, as well as for the source classesidentified in the simba survey, for variation of this index. our resultsindicate that $\beta$ is typically 2, which is consistent with previousdeterminations in the literature, but for a considerably larger sample thanprevious work.

astro-ph;0702673	a search for 22-ghz water masers within the giant molecular cloud  associated with rcw106	we report the results of a blind search for 22-ghz water masers in tworegions, covering approximately half a square degree, within the giantmolecular cloud associated with rcw 106. the complete search of the two regionswas carried out with the 26-m mount pleasant radio telescope and resulted inthe detection of nine water masers, five of which are new detections. australiatelescope compact array (atca) observations of these detections have allowed usto obtain positions with arcsecond accuracy, allowing meaningful comparisonwith infrared and molecular data for the region. we find that for the regionssurveyed there are more water masers than either 6.7-ghz methanol, or main-lineoh masers. the water masers are concentrated towards the central axis of thestar formation region, in contrast to the 6.7-ghz methanol masers which tend tobe located near the periphery. the colours of the glimpse point sourcesassociated with the water masers are similar to those of 6.7-ghz methanolmasers, but slightly less red. we have made a statistical investigation of theproperties of the 13co and 1.2-mm dust clumps with and without associated watermasers. we find that the water masers are associated with the more massive,denser and brighter 13co and 1.2-mm dust clumps. we present statistical modelsthat are able to predict those 13co and 1.2-mm dust clumps that are likely tohave associated water masers, with a low misclassification rate.

astro-ph;9709237	molecular hydrogen line emission from the reflection nebula parsamyan 18	the newly-commissioned university of new south wales infrared fabry-perot(unswirf) has been used to image molecular hydrogen emission at 2.12 and 2.25microns in the reflection nebula parsamyan 18. p 18 is known to exhibit lowvalues of the (1-0)/(2-1) s(1) ratio suggestive of uv-pumped fluorescencerather than thermal excitation by shocks. our line ratio mapping reveals thefull extent of this fluorescent emission from extended arc-like features, aswell as a more concentrated thermal component in regions closer to the centralexciting star. we show that the emission morphology, line fluxes, and gasdensity are consistent with the predictions of photodissociation region (pdr)theory. those regions with the highest intrinsic 1-0 s(1) intensities also tendto show the highest (1-0)/(2-1) s(1) line ratios. furthermore, variations inthe line ratio can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations in the incidentradiation field and/or the gas density, through the self-shielding action ofh_2. an isolated knot of emission discovered just outside p 18, and having bothan unusually high (1-0)/(2-1) s(1) ratio and relative velocity providesadditional evidence for an outflow source associated with p 18.

astro-ph;9908028	an infrared proper motion study of the orion bullets	we report the first ir proper motion measurements of the herbig-haro objectsin the orion molecular cloud--one using a four-year time baseline. the [fe ii]emitting bullets are moving of order 0.08 arcsec per year, or at about 170\kms. the direction of motion is similar to that inferred from theirmorphology. the proper motions of \h2 emitting wakes behind the [fe ii]bullets, and of newly found \h2 bullets, are also measured. \h2 bullets havesmaller proper motion than [fe ii] bullets, while \h2 wakes with leading [feii] bullets appear to move at similar speeds to their associated bullets. a fewinstances of variability in the emission can be attributed to dense, stationaryclumps in the ambient cloud being overrun, setting up a reverse--orientedbullet. differential motion between [fe ii] bullets and their trailing \h2wakes is not observed, suggesting that these are not separating, and also thatthey have reached a steady--state configuration over at least 100 years. themost distant bullets have, on average, larger proper motions, but are notconsistent with free expansion. nevertheless an impulsive, or short--lived($\ll$ 1,000 years) duration for their origin seems likely.

0705.4597	the rms survey: 13co observations of candidate massive ysos in the  southern hemisphere	abridged: the red msx source (rms) survey is an ongoing multi-wavelengthobservational programme designed to return a large, well-selected sample ofmassive young stellar objects (mysos). here we present 13co observations madetowards 854 mysos candidates located in the 3rd and 4th quadrants. we detected13co emission towards a total of 751 of the 854 rms sources observed (~88%). intotal 2185 emission components are detected above 3$\sigma$ level. multipleemission profiles are observed towards the majority of these sources - 455sources (~60%) - with an average of ~4 molecular clouds along the line ofsight. these multiple emission features make it difficult to assign a kinematicvelocity to many of our sample. we have used archival cs (j=2-1) and maservelocities to resolved the component multiplicity towards 82 sources and havederived a criterion which is used to identify the most likely component for afurther 202 multiple component sources. combined with the single componentdetections we have obtained unambiguous kinematic velocities towards 580sources (~80% of the detections). the 171 sources for which we have not beenable to determine the kinematic velocity will require additional line data.using the rotation curve of brand and blitz (1993) and their radial velocitieswe calculate kinematic distances for all components detected.

0810.3158	spectral energy distribution modelling of southern candidate massive  protostars using the bayesian inference method	concatenating data from the millimetre regime to the infrared, we haveperformed spectral energy distribution modelling for 227 of the 405 millimetrecontinuum sources of hill et al. (2005) which are thought to contain youngmassive stars in the earliest stages of their formation. three main parametersare extracted from the fits: temperature, mass and luminosity. the methodemployed was bayesian inference, which allows a statistically probable range ofsuitable values for each parameter to be drawn for each individual protostellarcandidate. this is the first application of this method to massive starformation.  the cumulative distribution plots of the sed modelled parameters in this workindicate that collectively, the sources without methanol maser and/or radiocontinuum associations (mm-only cores) display similar characteristics to thoseof high mass star formation regions. attributing significance to the marginaldistinctions between the mm-only cores and the high-mass star formation samplewe draw hypotheses regarding the nature of the mm-only cores, including thepossibility that the population itself is comprised of different types ofsource, and discuss their role in the formation scenarios of massive starformation. in addition, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of sedmodelling and its application to the field. from this work, it is clear thatwithin the valid parameter ranges, seds utilising current far-infrared data cannot be used to determine the evolution of massive protostars or massive youngstellar objects.

0812.1708	physical and chemical conditions in methanol maser selected hot-cores  and uchii regions	we present the results of a targeted 3-mm spectral line survey towards theeighty-three 6.67 ghz methanol maser selected star forming clumps observed bypurcell et al. 2006. in addition to the previously reported measurements ofhco+ (1 - 0), h13co+ (1 - 0), and ch3cn (5 - 4) &amp; (6 -5), we used the mopraantenna to detect emission lines of n2h+ (1 - 0), hcn (1 - 0) and hnc (1 - 0)towards 82/83 clumps (99 per cent), and ch3oh (2 - 1) towards 78/83 clumps (94per cent). the molecular line data have been used to derive virial and ltemasses, rotational temperatures and chemical abundances in the clumps, andthese properties have been compared between sub-samples associated withdifferent indicators of evolution. the greatest differences are found betweenclumps associated with 8.6 ghz radio emission, indicating the presence of anultra-compact hii region, and `isolated' masers (without associated radioemission), and between clumps exhibiting ch3cn emission and those without. inparticular, thermal ch3oh is found to be brighter and more abundant inultra-compact hii (uchii) regions and in sources with detected ch3cn, and mayconstitute a crude molecular clock in single dish observations. clumpsassociated with 8.6 ghz radio emission tend to be more massive and moreluminous than clumps without radio emission. this is likely because the mostmassive clumps evolve so rapidly that a hyper-compact hii or uchii region isthe first visible tracer of star-formation. the gas-mass to sub-mm/irluminosity relation for the combined sample was found to be l proportional tom**0.68, considerably shallower than expected for massive main-sequence stars.
