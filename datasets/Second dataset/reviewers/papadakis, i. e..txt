0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

0910.5365	a correlation between the spectral and timing properties of agn	we present the results from a combined study of the average x-ray spectraland timing properties of 14 nearby agn. for 11 of the sources in the sample, weused all the available data from the rxte archive, which were taken until theend of 2006. there are 7795 rxte observations in total for these agn, obtainedover a period of ~7-11 years. we extracted their 3-20 kev spectra and fittedthem with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a gaussian line(at 6.4 kev) and cold absorption, when necessary. we used these best-fit slopesto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results fromthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objectswithout archival, monitorin rxte data. our results show that the agn averagespectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or thecharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.they arepositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency whennormalised to the sources black hole mass. this is similar to thespectral-timing correlation that has been observed in cyg x-1, but not thesame.the agn spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that theaccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and thecharacteristic time scales in agn. the spectrum should steepen and thecharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasingaccretion rate. we also provide a quantitative expression between spectralslope and accretion rate. thermal comptonisation models are broadly consistentwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to thepower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretionrate.

0911.0265	the long term x-ray spectral variability of agn	we present the results from the spectral analysis of more than 7,500 rxtespectra of 10 agn, which have been observed by rxte regularly over a longperiod of time ~ 7-11 years. these observations most probably sample most ofthe flux and spectral variations that these objects exhibit, thus, they areideal for the study of their long term x-ray spectral variability. we modelledthe 3-10 spectrum of each observation in a uniform way using a simple power-lawmodel (with the addition of gaussian line and/or edge to model the iron kalphaemission/absorption features, if necessary) to consistently parametrize theshape of the observed x-ray continuum. we found that the average spectral slopedoes not correlate with source luminosity or black hole mass, while itcorrelates positively with the average accretion rate. we have also determinedthe (positive) "spectral slope-flux" relation for each object, over a largerflux range than before. we found that this correlation is similar in almost allobjects. we discuss this global "spectral slope-flux" trend in the light ofcurrent models for spectral variability. we consider (i) intrinsic variability,expected e.g. from comptonization processes, (ii) variability caused byabsorption of x-rays by a single absorber whose ionization parameter variesproportionally to the continuum flux variations, (iii) variability resultingfrom the superposition of a constant reflection component and an intrinsicpower-law which is variable in flux but constant in shape, and, (iv)variability resulting from the superposition of a constant reflection componentand an intrinsic power-law which is variable both in flux and shape. our finalconclusion is that scenario (iv) describes better our results.

0912.4416	xmm-newton long-look observation of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy  pks0558-504; i: spectral analysis	we present results from the spectral analysis of a long xmm-newtonobservation of the radio-loud nls1 galaxy pks0558-504. the source is highlyvariable, on all sampled time scales. we did not observe any absorptionfeatures in either the soft or hard x-ray band. we found weak evidence for thepresence of an iron line at ~6.8 kev, which is indicative of emission fromhighly ionized iron. the 2-10 kev band spectrum is well fitted by a simplepower law model, whose slope steepens with increasing flux, similar to what isobserved in other seyferts as well. the soft excess is variable both in fluxand shape, and it can be well described by a low-temperature comptonisationmodel, whose slope flattens with increasing flux. the soft excess fluxvariations are moderately correlated with the hard band variations, and wefound weak evidence that they are leading them by ~20 ksec. our results ruleout a jet origin for the bulk of the x-ray emission in this object. theobserved hard band spectral variations suggest intrinsic continuum slopevariations, caused by changes in the "heating/cooling" ratio of the hot corona.the low-temperature comptonising medium, responsible for the soft excessemission, could be a hot layer in the inner disc of the source, which appearsdue to the fact that the source is accreting at a super-eddington rate. thesoft excess flux and spectral variations could be caused by random variationsof the accretion rate.

0912.4676	characterizing black hole variability with nonlinear methods: the case  of the x-ray nova 4u 1543-47	we investigate the possible nonlinear variability properties of the blackhole x-ray nova 4u1543-47 to complement the temporal studies based on lineartechniques, and to search for signs of nonlinearity in galactic black hole(gbh) light curves. first, we apply the weighted scaling index method (wsim) tocharacterize the x-ray variability properties of 4u1543-47 in differentspectral states during the 2002 outburst. second, we use surrogate data toinvestigate whether the variability is nonlinear in any of the differentspectral states. the main findings can be summarized as follows. the meanweighted scaling index appears to be able to parametrize uniquely the temporalvariability properties of this gbh: the 3 different spectral states of the 2002outburst of 4u1543-47 are characterized by different and well constrainedvalues. the search for nonlinearity reveals that the variability is linear inall light curves with the notable exception of the very high state. our resultsimply that we can use the wsim to assign a single number, namely the meanweighted scaling index, to a light curve, and in this way discriminate amongthe different spectral states of a source. the detection of nonlinearity in thevhs, that is characterized by the presence of most prominent qpos, suggeststhat intrinsically linear models which have been proposed to account for thelow frequency qpos in gbhs may be ruled out (abridged).

1005.4933	a panchromatic view of pks 0558-504: an ideal laboratory to study the  disk-jet link	pks 0558-504 is the brightest radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy atx-ray energies. here we present results from the radio, optical, uv, and x-raybands obtained with swift, xmm, and atca during a 10-day monitoring campaign inseptember 2008. the simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths makes itpossible to investigate in detail the broadband spectral energy distribution(sed) and the energetic of this source. the main results can be summarized asfollows. the atca reveals the presence of an extended radio emission in pks0558-504 with two lobe-like structures at ~7" from the bright central source.the extended radio structure and the low value of the radio-loudness similar toradio-quiet seyfert galaxies coupled with constraints from higher energy bandsargue against a jet-dominated emission. the study of the sed, which isdominated by a nearly constant optical-uv emission, supports the conclusionthat pks 0558-504 is accreting at super-eddington rate. this conclusion wasreached assuming m_bh=2.5e8 m_sun, which was obtained with a new scaling methodbased on x-ray spectral variability results. a comparison between the accretionluminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in thissource the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtainedfrom radiation-mhd simulations of galactic black holes (gbhs) accreting at theeddington rate. the combined findings from this panchromatic investigationstrongly suggest that pks 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of gbhs in theirhighly accreting intermediate state. importantly, pks 0558-504 may also be theprototype of the parent population of the very radio-loud nls1s recentlydetected at gamma-ray energies.

0709.0262	discovery of multiple lorentzian components in the x-ray timing  properties of the narrow line seyfert 1 ark 564	we present a power spectral analysis of a 100 ksec xmm-newton observation ofthe narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ark~564. when combined with earlier rxte andasca observations, these data produce a power spectrum covering seven decadesof frequency which is well described by a power law with two very clear breaks.this shape is unlike the power spectra of almost all other agn observed so far,which have only one detected break, and resemble galactic binary systems in asoft state. the power spectrum can also be well described by the sum of twolorentzian-shaped components, the one at higher frequencies having a hardspectrum, similar to those seen in galactic binary systems. previously we havedemonstrated that the lag of the hard band variations relative to the soft bandin ark 564 is dependent on variability time-scale, as seen in galactic binarysources. here we show that the time-scale dependence of the lags can bedescribed well using the same two-lorentzian model which describes the powerspectrum, assuming that each lorentzian component has a distinct time lag. thusall x-ray timing evidence points strongly to two discrete, localised, regionsas the origin of most of the variability. similar behaviour is seen in galacticx-ray binary systems in most states other than the soft state, i.e. in thelow-hard and intermediate/very high states. given the very high accretion rateof ark 564 the closest analogy is with the very high (intermediate) staterather than the low-hard state. we therefore strengthen the comparison betweenagn and galactic binary sources beyond previous studies by extending it to thepreviously poorly studied very high accretion rate regime.

1108.6017	hard x-ray spectral variability of the brightest seyfert agn in the  swift/bat sample	aims: we used data from the 58 month long, continuous swift/burst alerttelescope (bat) observations of the five brightest seyfert galaxies at hardx-rays, to study their flux and spectral variability in the 20-100 kev energyband. the column density in these objects is less than 10^24 cm-2, whichimplies that the swift/bat data allow us to study the "true" variability of thecentral source. results: all objects show significant variations, with anamplitude which is similar to the agn variability amplitude at energies below10 kev. we found evidence for an anti-correlation between variability amplitudeand black hole mass. the light curves in both bands are well correlated, withno significant delays on time scales as short as 2 days. ngc 4151 and ngc 2110do not show spectral variability, but we found a significant anti-correlationbetween hardness ratios and source flux in ngc 4388 (and ngc 4945, ic 4329, toa lesser extent). this "softer when brighter" behaviour is similar to what hasbeen observed at energies below 10 kev, and cannot be explained if thecontinuum varies only in flux; the intrinsic shape should also steepen withincreasing flux. conclusions: the presence of significant flux variationsindicate that the central source in these objects is intrinsically variable ontime scales as short as 1-2 days. the intrinsic slope of the continuum varieswith the flux (at least in ngc 4388). the positive "spectral slope-flux"correlation can be explained if the temperature of the hot corona decreaseswith increasing flux. the lack of spectral variations in two objects, could bedue to the fact that they may operate in a different "state", as theiraccretion rate is less than 1% of the eddington limit (significantly smallerthan the rate of the other three objects in the sample).

1205.3524	the `harder when brighter' x-ray behaviour of the low luminosity active  galactic nucleus ngc 7213	we present the first robust evidence of an anti-correlation between the x-rayphoton index, \gamma, and the x-ray luminosity in a single low luminosityactive galactic nuclei (llagn), ngc 7213. up to now, such anti-correlationtrends have been seen only in large samples of llagn that span a wide range ofx-ray fluxes, although the opposite behaviour (i.e. a positive correlationbetween \gamma and x-ray luminosity) has been extensively studied forindividual x-ray bright active galactic nuclei. for ngc 7213, we use thelong-term x-ray monitoring data of rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte),regularly obtained on average every two days from march 2006 to december 2009.based on our x-ray data, we derive the \gamma versus flux and the hardnessratio versus flux relations, indicating clearly that ngc 7213 follows a `harderwhen brighter' spectral behaviour. additionally, by analysing radio and opticaldata, and combining data from the literature, we form the most completespectral energy distribution (sed) of the source across the electromagneticspectrum yielding a bolometric luminosity of 1.7*10^43 erg s^-1.phenomenologically, the sed of ngc 7213 is similar to that of low-ionizationnuclear emission-line region. the robust anti-correlation trend that we findbetween \gamma and x-ray luminosity together with the low accretion rate of thesource, 0.14 per cent that of eddington limit, make ngc 7213 the first llagnexhibiting a similar spectral behaviour with that of black hole x-ray binariesin `hard state'.

1305.0304	generating artificial light curves: revisited and updated	the production of artificial light curves with known statistical andvariability properties is of great importance in astrophysics. consolidatingthe confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding theartefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits forfuture observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets.currently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation isable to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying powerspectral density (psd) but which are strictly gaussian distributed. thisrestriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curvese.g. active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strongdeviations from gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their lightcurves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (pdfs). in thisstudy we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce lightcurves which match both the psd and the pdf of either an observed light curveor a theoretical model. the pdf can be representative of either the parentdistribution or the actual distribution of the observed data, depending on thestudy to be conducted for a given source. the final artificial light curvescontain all of the statistical and variability properties of the observedsource or theoretical model i.e. same pdf and psd, respectively. within theframework of reproducible research, the code, together with the illustrativeexample used in this manuscript, are both made publicly available in the formof an interactive mathematica notebook.

1305.3573	long-term monitoring of pks0558-504 with swift: the disc-corona link	pks 0558-504 is a highly variable, x-ray bright, radio-loud, narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy with super-eddington accretion rate and extended jets that donot dominate the emission beyond the radio band. therefore, this sourcerepresents an ideal laboratory to shed some light on the central engine inhighly accreting systems and specifically on the link between accretion discand corona. here we present the results from a 1.5 year monitoring with swiftxrt and uvot. the simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths confirms thatpks 0558-504 is highly variable in any band from optical, to uv and x-rays,with the latter showing the largest amplitude changes but with the uv emissiondominating the radiative output. a cross-correlation analysis reveals a tightlink between the emission in the optical and uv bands and provides suggestiveevidence in favor of a scenario where the variability originates in the outerpart of the accretion flow and propagates inwards before triggering theactivity of the x-ray emitting corona. finally, a positive correlation betweenthe soft x-ray flux and the hard photon index suggests that in pks 0558-504 theseed photons are provided to the corona by the soft excess component.

0801.2104	long-term x-ray monitoring of ngc6251: evidence for a jet-dominated  radio galaxy	we present the first x-ray monitoring observations of the x-ray bright friradio galaxy ngc6251 observed with rxte for 1 year. the primary goal of thisstudy is to shed light on the origin of the x-rays, by investigating thespectral variability with model-independent methods coupled with time-resolvedand flux-selected spectroscopy. the main results can be summarized as follows:1) throughout the monitoring campaign, ngc6251 was in relatively high-fluxstate. 2) the flux persistently changed with fluctuations of the order of ~2 ontime scales of 20-30 days. 3) when the hardness ratio is plotted against theaverage count rate, there is evidence for a spectral hardening as the sourcebrightens; this finding is confirmed by a flux-selected spectral analysis. 4)the fractional variability appears to be more pronounced in the hard energyband (5-12 kev) than in the soft one (2.5-5 kev). 5) 2-month averaged andflux-limited energy spectra are adequately fitted by a power law. a fe kalphaline is never statistically required, although the presence of a strong ironline cannot be ruled out, due to the high upper limits on the line equivalentwidth. the inconsistency of the spectral variability behavior of ngc6251 withthe typical trend observed in seyfert galaxies and the similarity with blazarslead support to a jet-dominated scenario during the rxte monitoring campaign.however, a possible contribution from a disk-corona system cannot be ruled out.

1309.0388	evidence for a change in the radiation mechanism in the hard state of  gro j1655-40. hysteresis in the broad-band noise components	we have analysed rxte archival data to study the aperiodic variability of theblack-hole binary gro j1655-40 during the hard state of the 2005 outburst. wecomputed the 0.008-64 hz power spectral density during the rise and decay ofthe 2005 outburst, and we found that they were reasonably well modelled by thesum of two, broad lorenztian functions in most cases (plus a narrow qpo) whichcorrespond to three different variability components. our aim is to study theevolution of the timing properties of the source during the outburst, bystudying the correlation between the characteristics of the broad-band noisecomponents in the power spectra and the source luminosity. our results suggestthat the whole power spectrum shifts to high (low) frequencies as the sourceluminosity increases (decreases), in agreement with previous studies of otherblack hole binaries. however, we also detect a strong "hysteresis" pattern inthe "frequency-luminosity" plots, and show that the "critical" luminositylimit, above which the timing properties of the source change, is differentduring the rise and the decay phase of the outburst. we discuss the generalimplications of these results in the context of the truncated disc model.

1402.0899	general relativistic modelling of the negative reverberation x-ray time  delays in agn	we present the first systematic physical modelling of the time-lag spectrabetween the soft (0.3-1 kev) and the hard (1.5-4 kev) x-ray energy bands, as afunction of fourier frequency, in a sample of 12 active galactic nuclei whichhave been observed by xmm-newton. we concentrate particularly on the negativex-ray time-lags (typically seen above $10^{-4}$ hz) i.e. soft band variationslag the hard band variations, and we assume that they are produced byreprocessing and reflection by the accretion disc within a lamp-post x-raysource geometry. we also assume that the response of the accretion disc, in thesoft x-ray bands, is adequately described by the response in the neutral ironline (fe k$\alpha$) at 6.4 kev for which we use fully general relativisticray-tracing simulations to determine its time evolution. these responsefunctions, and thus the corresponding time-lag spectra, yield much morerealistic results than the commonly-used, but erroneous, top-hat models.additionally we parametrize the positive part of the time-lag spectra(typically seen below $10^{-4}$ hz) by a power-law. we find that thebest-fitting bh masses, m, agree quite well with those derived by othermethods, thus providing us with a new tool for bh mass determination. we findno evidence for any correlation between m and the bh spin parameter, $\alpha$,the viewing angle, $\theta$, or the height of the x-ray source above the disc,$h$. also on average, the x-ray source lies only around 3.7 gravitational radiiabove the accretion disc and the viewing angles are distributed uniformlybetween 20 and 60 degrees. finally, there is a tentative indication that thedistribution of spin parameters may be bimodal above and below 0.62.

1404.1078	active galactic nuclei synapses: x-ray versus optical classifications  using artificial neural networks	(abridged) many classes of active galactic nuclei (agn) have been definedentirely throughout optical wavelengths while the x-ray spectra have been veryuseful to investigate their inner regions. however, optical and x-ray resultsshow many discrepancies that have not been fully understood yet. the aim ofthis paper is to study the "synapses" between the x-ray and opticalclassifications.  for the first time, the new efluxer task allowed us to analyse broad bandx-ray spectra of emission line nuclei (eln) without any prior spectral fittingusing artificial neural networks (anns). our sample comprises 162 xmm-newton/pnspectra of 90 local eln in the palomar sample. it includes starbursts (sb),transition objects (t2), liners (l1.8 and l2), and seyferts (s1, s1.8, and s2).  the anns are 90% efficient at classifying the trained classes s1, s1.8, andsb. the s1 and s1.8 classes show a wide range of s1- and s1.8-like components.we suggest that this is related to a large degree of obscuration at x-rays. thes1, s1.8, s2, l1.8, l2/t2/sb-agn (sb with indications of agn), and sb classeshave similar average x-ray spectra within each class, but these average spectracan be distinguished from class to class. the s2 (l1.8) class is linked to thes1.8 (s1) class with larger sb-like component than the s1.8 (s1) class. the l2,t2, and sb-agn classes conform a class in the x-rays similar to the s2 classalbeit with larger fractions of sb-like component. this sb-like component isthe contribution of the star-formation in the host galaxy, which is large whenthe agn is weak. an agn-like component seems to be present in the vast majorityof the eln, attending to the non-negligible fraction of s1-like or s1.8-likecomponent. this trained ann could be used to infer optical properties fromx-ray spectra in surveys like erosita.

0803.1668	fourier-resolved energy spectra of the narrow line seyfert 1 mkn 766	we compute fourier-resolved x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 markarian 766 tostudy the shape of the variable components contributing to the 0.3-10 kevenergy spectrum and their time-scale dependence. the fractional variabilityspectra peak at 1-3 kev, as in other seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with eithera constant contribution from a soft excess component below 1 kev and comptonreflection component above 2 kev, or variable warm absorption enhancing thevariability in the 1-3 kev range. the rms spectra, which shows the shape of thevariable components only, is well described by a single power law with anabsorption feature around 0.7 kev, which gives it an apparent soft excess. thisspectral shape can be produced by a power law varying in normalisation,affected by an approximately constant (within each orbit) warm absorber, withparameters similar to those found by turner et al. for the warm-absorber layercovering all spectral components in their scattering scenario. the total softexcess in the average spectrum can therefore be produced by a combination ofconstant warm absorption on the power law plus an additional less variablecomponent. on shorter time-scales, the rms spectrum hardens and this evolutionis well described by a change in power law slope, while the absorptionparameters remain the same. the frequency dependence of the rms spectra can beinterpreted as variability arising from propagating fluctuations through anextended emitting region, whose emitted spectrum is a power law that hardenstowards the centre. this scenario reduces the short time-scale variability oflower energy bands making the variable spectrum harder on shorter time-scalesand at the same time explains the hard lags found in these data by markowitz etal.

1508.02589	variability of the soft x-ray excess in iras 13224-3809	we study the soft excess variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy iras13224-3809. we considered all five archival xmm-newton observations, and weapplied the 'flux-flux plot' (ffp) method. we found that the flux-flux plotswere highly affected by the choice of the light curves' time bin size, mostprobably because of the fast and large amplitude variations, and the intrinsicnon-linear flux--flux relations in this source. therefore, we recommend thatthe smallest bin-size should be used in such cases. hence, we constructed ffpsin 11 energy bands below 1.7 kev, and we considered the 1.7-3 kev band, asbeing representative of the primary emission. the ffps are reasonably wellfitted by a 'power-law plus a constant' model. we detected significant positiveconstants in three out of five observations. the best-fit slopes are flatterthan unity at energies below $\sim 0.9$ kev, where the soft excess isstrongest. this suggests the presence of intrinsic spectral variability. apower-law-like primary component, which is variable in flux and spectral slope(as $\gamma\propto n_{\rm pl}^{0.1}$) and a soft-excess component, which varieswith the primary continuum (as $f_{\rm excess}\propto f_{\rm primary}^{0.46}$),can broadly explain the ffps. in fact, this can create positive `constants',even when a stable spectral component does not exist. nevertheless, thepossibility of a stable, soft--band constant component cannot be ruled out, butits contribution to the observed 0.2-1 kev band flux should be less than $\sim15$ %. the model constants in the ffps were consistent with zero in oneobservation, and negative at energies below 1 kev in another. it is hard toexplain these results in the context of any spectral variability scenario, butthey may signify the presence of a variable, warm absorber in the source.

1510.02817	flux and spectral variability of the blazar pks 2155-304 with  xmm-newton: evidence of particle acceleration and synchrotron cooling	we have analyzed xmm-newton observations of the high energy peaked blazar,pks 2155-304, made on 24 may 2002 in the 0.3 - 10 kev x-ray band. theseobservations display a mini-flare, a nearly constant flux period and a strongflux increase. we performed a time-resolved spectral study of the data, bydividing the data into eight segments. we fitted the data with a power-law anda broken power-law model, and in some of the segments we found a noticeablespectral flattening of the source's spectrum below 10 kev. we also performedtime-resolved cross-correlation analyses and detected significant hard and softlags (for the first time in a single observation of this source) during thefirst and last parts of the observation, respectively. our analysis of thespectra, the variations of photon-index with flux as well as the correlationand lags between the harder and softer x-ray bands indicate that both theparticle acceleration and synchrotron cooling processes make an importantcontribution to the emission from this blazar. the hard lags indicate avariable acceleration process. we also estimated the magnetic field value usingthe soft lags. the value of the magnetic field is consistent with the valuesderived from the broad-band sed modeling of this source.

astro-ph;0105238	temporal characteristics of the x-ray emission of ngc 7469	we present a study of the time variability of ngc 7469, based on a ~30 drxte/pca observation. variability is seen across the x-ray band, and spectralchanges are observed. the softness ratio is correlated with the ultravioletflux, but appears to show more rapid variability. the rms variability parametercalculated on ~1d time scales is significantly variable, and sharp increasesare seen close to the periods where the spectrum is hardest. cross correlationof 2-4 kev, 4-10 kev and 10-15 kev light curves show a peak at zero delay, butthe ccfs are skewed towards positive lags (i.e. the soft leading the hard) withan apparent time lag of about 0.5d. the power spectral density (psd) functionin the 2-10 kev band shows no clear features - for example periodicities orbreaks - but a power law is a rather poor fit, particularly to the highfrequency spectrum. the normalized psd in the soft x-ray band shows a largeramplitude of variability on long time scales but the hard x-ray psd is flatter,and shows more power on time scales less than about 1d. our data broadlysupport the idea that the x-rays are produced by compton upscattering oflower-energy seed photons, as had been previously concluded. they are difficultto reconcile with models in which the sole source of variability is the seedphotons, and more likely suggest a variability process intrinsic to the x-raycorona. our interpretation for these results is that the low-frequencyvariability in ngc 7469 does arise via variations in the compton seed photons,but that the high frequency variability arises from the coronal heatingmechanism (truncated)

astro-ph;0201134	measuring the broadband power spectra of active galactic nuclei with  rxte	we have developed a monte carlo technique to test models for the true powerspectra of intermittently sampled lightcurves against the noisy, observed powerspectra, and produce a reliable estimate of the goodness of fit of the givenmodel. we apply this technique to constrain the broadband power spectra of asample of four seyfert galaxies monitored by the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) over three years. we show that the power spectra of three of the agn inour sample (mcg-6-30-15, ngc5506 and ngc3516) flatten significantly towards lowfrequencies, while the power spectrum of ngc5548 shows no evidence offlattening. we fit two models for the flattening, a `knee' model, analogous tothe low-frequency break seen in the power spectra of bhxrbs in the low state(where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=0) and a `high-frequencybreak' model (where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=1), analogousto the high-frequency break seen in the high and low-state power spectra of theclassic bhxrb cyg x-1. both models provide good fits to the power spectra ofall four agn. for both models, the characteristic frequency for flattening issignificantly higher in mcg-6-30-15 than in ngc 3516 (by factor ~10) althoughboth sources have similar x-ray luminosities, suggesting that mcg-6-30-15 has alower black hole mass and is accreting at a higher rate than ngc 3516. assuminglinear scaling of characteristic frequencies with black hole mass, the highaccretion rate implied for mcg-6-30-15 favours the high-frequency break modelfor this source and further suggests that mcg-6-30-15 and possibly ngc 5506,may be analogues of cyg x-1 in the high state [abridged].

astro-ph;0203376	a morphological comparison between the central region in agn and normal  galaxies using hst data	we study the morphology of the central region of a sample of active galacticnuclei (agn) and a ``control'' sample of normal galaxies using archivalobservations of the wfpc2 instrument onboard the hubble space telescope (hst).we use the ellipse fitting technique in order to get a good description of theinner ``smooth'' light distribution of the galaxy. we then divide the observedgalaxy image by the artificial image from the fitted ellipses in order todetect morphological signatures in the central region around the nucleus of thegalaxy. we perform quantitative comparisons of different subgroups of oursample of galaxies (according to the hubble type and the nuclear activity ofthe galaxies) by calculating the average amplitude of the structures that arerevealed with the ellipse fitting technique. our main conclusions are asfollows: 1) all agns show significant structure in their inner 100 pc and 1 kpcregions whose amplitude is similar in all of them, independent of the hubbletype of the host galaxy. 2) when considering early-type galaxies, non-agngalaxies show no structure at all, contrary to what we find for agn. 3) whenconsidering late-type galaxies, both agn and non-agn galaxies show significantstructure in their central region. our results are consistent with thehypothesis that all early-type galaxies host a supermassive black hole, butonly those that have enough material in the central regions to fuel it show anactive nucleus. the situation is more complicated in late-type galaxies. eithernot all of them host a central black hole, or, in some of them, the materialinside the innermost 100 pc region is not transported to the scales of thecentral engine for some reason, or the large amount of gas and dust hides theactive nucleus from our sight.

astro-ph;0206190	on the nature of x-ray variability in ark 564	we use data from a recent long asca observation of the narrow line seyfert 1ark 564 to investigate in detail its timing properties. we show that a thoroughanalysis of the time series, employing techniques not generally applied to agnlight curves, can provide useful information to characterize the engines ofthese powerful sources.we searched for signs of non-stationarity in the data,but did not find strong evidences for it. we find that the process causing thevariability is very likely nonlinear, suggesting that variability models basedon many active regions, as the shot noise model, may not be applicable to ark564. the complex light curve can be viewed, for a limited range of time scales,as a fractal object with non-trivial fractal dimension and statisticalself-similarity. finally, using a nonlinear statistic based on the scalingindex as a tool to discriminate time series, we demonstrate that the high andlow count rate states, which are indistinguishable on the basis of theirautocorrelation, structure and probability density functions, are intrinsicallydifferent, with the high state characterized by higher complexity.

astro-ph;0302518	optical and radio behaviour of the bl lacertae object 0716+714	eight optical and four radio observatories have been intensively monitoringthe bl lac object 0716+714 in the last years: 4854 data points have beencollected in the ubvri bands since 1994, while radio light curves extend backto 1978. many of these data are presented here for the first time. thelong-term trend shown by the optical light curves seems to vary with acharacteristic time scale of about 3.3 years, while a longer period of 5.5-6years seems to characterize the radio long-term variations. in general, opticalcolour indices are only weakly correlated with brightness. the radio fluxbehaviour at different frequencies is similar, but the flux variation amplitudedecreases with increasing wavelength. the radio spectral index varies withbrightness (harder when brighter), but the radio fluxes seem to be the sum oftwo different-spectrum contributions: a steady base level and a harder-spectrumvariable component. once the base level is removed, the radio variations appearas essentially achromatic, similarly to the optical behaviour. flux variationsat the higher radio frequencies lead the lower-frequency ones with week-monthtime scales. the behaviour of the optical and radio light curves is quitedifferent, the broad radio outbursts not corresponding in time to the fasteroptical ones and the cross-correlation analysis indicating only weakcorrelation with long time lags. however, minor radio flux enhancementssimultaneous with the major optical flares can be recognized, which may implythat the mechanism producing the strong flux increases in the optical band alsomarginally affects the radio one.

astro-ph;0311016	the scaling of the x-ray variability with black hole mass in agn	the relation between the 2-10 kev, long term, excess variance and agn blackhole mass is considered in this work. a significant anti-correlation is foundbetween these two quantities in the sense that the excess variance decreaseswith increasing black hole mass. this anti-correlation is consistent with thehypothesis that the 2-10 kev power spectrum in agn follows a power law of slope-2 at high frequencies. it then flattens to a slope of -1 below a breakfrequency until a second break frequency below which it flattens to a slope ofzero. the ratio of the two break frequencies is equal to 10-30, similar to theratio of the respective frequencies in cyg x-1. the power spectrum amplitude inthe "frequency x power" space does not depend on black hole mass. instead it isroughly equal to 0.02 in all objects. the high frequency break decreases withincreasing black hole mass according to the relation 1.5x(10^-6)/(bhmass/(10^7)solar masses) hz, in the case of "classical" seyfert 1 galaxies. the excessvariance of ngc4051, a narrow line seyfert 1 object, is larger than what isexpected for its black hole mass and x-ray luminosity. this can be explained ifits high frequency break is 20 times larger than the value expected in the caseof a "classical" seyfert 1 with the same black hole mass. finally, the excessvariance vs x-ray luminosity correlation is a byproduct of the excess variancevs black hole mass correlation, with agn accreting at ~ 0.1-0.15 the eddingtonlimit. these results are consistent with recent results from the power spectralanalysis of agn.

(2000) to describe theoverall ultra-violet (uv), optical and fir spectral energy distribution (sed)of a spiral galaxy. the model has only three free parameters: sfr, dust mass,and the fraction of the uv radiation which is absorbed locally by dense dust inthe hii regions. using this model, we are able to fit well the fir spectra of62 bright, iras galaxies from the "scuba local universe galaxy survey" of dunneet al.(2000). as a result, we are able to determine, among others, their sfrand dust mass. we find that, on average, the sfr (in absolute units), thestar-formation efficiency, the sfr surface density, and the ratio of firluminosity over the total intrinsic luminosity, are larger than the respectivevalues of typical spiral galaxies of the same morphological type. we also findthat the mean gas-to-dust mass ratio is close to the galactic value, while theaverage central face-on optical depth of these galaxies in the v band is 2.3.finally, we find a strong correlation between sfr or dust mass and observed firquantities like total fir luminosity or fir luminosity at 100 and 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$. these correlations yield well defined relations, which can beused to determine a spiral galaxy's sfr and dust-mass content from firobservations.

astro-ph;0602516	fourier resolved spectroscopy of 4u 1543-47 during the 2002 outburst	we have obtained fourier-resolved spectra of the black-hole binary 4u 1543-47in the canonical states (high/soft, very high, intermediate and low/hard)observed in this source during the decay of an outburst that took place in2002. our objective is to investigate the variability of the spectralcomponents generally used to describe the energy spectra of black-hole systems,namely a disk component, a power-law component attributed to comptonization bya hot corona and the contribution of the iron line due to reprocessing of thehigh energy (e &gt; 7 kev) radiation. we find that i) the disk component is notvariable on time scales shorter than ~100 seconds, ii) the reprocessingemission as manifest by the variability of the fe kalpha line responds to theprimary radiation variations down to time scales of ~70 ms in the high andvery-high states, but longer than 2 s in the low state, iii) the low-frequencyqpos are associated with variations of the x-ray power law spectral componentand not to the disk component and iv) the spectra corresponding to the highestfourier frequency are the hardest  (show the flatter spectra) at a given spectral state. these results questionmodels that explain the observed power spectra as due to modulations of theaccretion rate alone, as such models do not provide any apparent reason for afourier frequency dependence of the power law spectral indices.

astro-ph;0607596	spectral-timing evidence for a very high state in the narrow line  seyfert 1 ark 564	we use a 100 ks long xmm-newton observation of the narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy ark 564 and combine it with the month-long monitoring of the same sourceproduced by asca, to calculate the phase lags and coherence between differentenergy bands, over frequencies ~ 10^{-6} to 10^{-3} hz. this is the widestfrequency range for which these spectral-timing properties have been calculatedaccurately for any agn. the 0.7-2 and 2--0 kev asca light curves, and thexmm-newton light curves in corresponding energy bands, are highly coherent (~0.9) over most of the frequency range studied. we observe time lags between theenergy bands, increasing both with time-scale and with energy separation of thebands. the time lag spectrum shows a broad peak in the 10^{-5} - 5x10^{-4} hzfrequency range, where the time lags follow a power law slope ~ -0.7. above ~ 5x 10^{-4} hz the lags drop below this relation significantly. this change inslope resembles the shape of the lag spectra of black hole x-ray binaries(bhxrb) in the very high or intermediate state. the lags increase linearly withthe logarithm of the separation of the energy bands, which poses one moresimilarity between this agn and bhxrbs.

astro-ph;0610154	xmm-newton observation of the nls1 galaxy ark 564: i. spectral analysis  of the time-average spectrum	we use the data from a recent, 100 ksec xmm-newton observation of the narrowline seyfert 1 galaxy ark 564 to obtain its time average, x-ray spectrum. the3-11 kev spectrum is well fitted by a power-law of slope 2.43. we detect a weak(equivalent width ~80 ev) emission line at ~6.7 kev, which implies emissionfrom ionized iron. there is no compelling evidence for significant broadeningof the line.we also detect a possible doppler shifted absorption line at 8.1kev. at energies lower than 2 kev, the spectrum is dominated by a smooth softexcess component which can be well fitted either by a two black body components(kt~0.15 and 0.07 kev) or by a black body plus a relativistically blurredphotoionized disc reflection model. we detect a broad, shallow flux deficit inthe 0.65-0.85 kev band, reminiscent of the iron unresolved transition array(uta) features. we do not detect neither a strong absorption edge around 0.7kev nor an emission line around 1 kev. the soft excess emission is consistentwith being reflected emission from a geometrically flat disc, with solarabundances, illuminated by an isotropic source. the weakness of the iron lineemission can be explained by relativistic blurring. the uta feature implies thepresence of warm material with a column density of 2-5*10^{20} cm^{-2}. if theabsorption line at 8.1 kev corresponds to fexxvi kalpha, it suggests thepresence of a highly ionized absorbing material with n_h &gt; 10^{23} cm^{-2},outflowing at a high velocity of ~0.17c.

astro-ph;0610283	a longer xmm-newton look at i zwicky 1: variability of the x-ray  continuum, absorption, and iron kalpha line	we present the second xmm-newton observation (85 ks) of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) i zw 1 and describe its mean spectral and timingcharacteristics. on average, i zw 1 is ~35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than in theshorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. between the two epochs the intrinsicabsorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle changes in thecontinuum shape. considering the blurred ionised reflection model, thelong-term changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the powerlaw component relative to the total spectrum. examination of normalised lightcurves indicates that the high-energy variations are quite structured and thatthere are delays, but only in some parts of the light curve. interestingly, ahard x-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure in the meanlight curve, a flux dip ~25 ks into the observation. the previously discoveredbroad, ionised fe ka line shows significant variations over the course of the2005 observation. the amplitude of the variations is 25-45 per cent and theyare unlikely due to changes in the fe ka-producing region, but perhaps arisefrom orbital motion around the black hole or obscuration in the broad ironline-emitting region. the 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the feka line at that epoch. there is evidence of energy and flux variations that areassociated with a hard x-ray flare that occurred during that observation.

0809.1750	the x-ray variability and the near-ir to x-ray spectral energy  distribution of four low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies	we present the results from a study of the x-ray variability and the near-irto x-ray spectral energy distribution of four low-luminosity, seyfert 1galaxies. we compared their variability amplitude and broad band spectrum withthose of more luminous agn in order to investigate whether accretion inlow-luminosity agn operates as in their luminous counterparts. we used archivalxmm-newton and, in two cases, asca data to estimate their x-ray variabilityamplitude and determine their x-ray spectral shape and luminosity. we also usedarchival hst data to measure their optical nuclear luminosity, and near-irmeasurements from the literature, in order to construct their near-ir to x-rayspectra. the x-ray variability amplitude of the four seyferts is what one wouldexpect, given their black hole masses. their near-ir to x-ray spectrum has thesame shape as the spectrum of quasars which are 10^2-10^5 times more luminous.the objects in our sample are optically classified as seyfert 1-1.5. thisimplies that they host a relatively unobscured agn-like nucleus. they are alsoof low luminosity and accrete at a low rate. they are therefore good candidatesto detect radiation from an inefficient accretion process. however, our resultssuggest that they are similar to agn which are 10^2-10^5 times more luminous.the combination of a "radiative efficient accretion disc plus an x-rayproducing hot corona" may persist at low accretion rates as well.

astro-ph;0611072	the energy-dependent x-ray timing characteristics of the narrow line  seyfert 1 mkn 766	we present the energy-dependent power spectral density (psd) andcross-spectral properties of mkn 766, obtained from combining data obtainedduring an xmm-newton observation spanning six revolutions in 2005 with dataobtained from an xmm-newton long-look in 2001. the psd shapes and rms-fluxrelations are found to be consistent between the 2001 and 2005 observations,suggesting the 2005 observation is simply a low-flux extension of the 2001observation and permitting us to combine the two data sets. the resulting psdhas the highest temporal frequency resolution for any agn psd measured to date.applying a broken power-law model yields break frequencies which increase intemporal frequency with photon energy. obtaining a good fit when assumingenergy-independent break frequencies requires the presence of a lorentzian at4.6+/-0.4 * 10^-4 hz whose strength increases with photon energy, a behaviorseen in black hole x-ray binaries. the cross-spectral properties are measured;temporal frequency-dependent soft-to-hard time lags are detected in this objectfor the first time. cross-spectral results are consistent with those for otheraccreting black hole systems. the results are discussed in the context ofseveral variability models, including those based on inwardly-propagatingviscosity variations in the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0611348	long-term x-ray spectral variability of the radio-loud nls1 galaxy pks  0558-504	we present x-ray observations of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pks0558-504 obtained with rxte during a 1-year monitoring campaign. this source,which is one of the very few radio-loud nls1 galaxies, shows strong x-ray fluxvariability on time scales of weeks-months accompanied by spectral variability.the main goal of this study is to investigate the spectral variability withmodel-independent methods and time-resolved spectroscopy in order to shed lighton the origin of the x-rays. the main results can be summarized as follows: 1)the flux typically changes by a factor of 1.5-2 on time scales of 10-30 days,with few extreme events where the flux increases by a factor of ~4 in 3 days.2) we do not observe any large amplitude, flux related spectral variations.during the flux variations, the spectrum varies mainly in normalization and notin shape. we do observe some small amplitude spectral variations, which do notcorrelate with flux, although there is a hint of spectral hardening as thesource brightens. 3) there is no evidence for reprocessing features such as thefe kalpha line or a compton hump. we argue that pks 0558-504 is a peculiarobject that appears to be different from most of the radio-quiet and radio-loudagn. if a jet is responsible for the bulk of the x-rays, it must operate in anunusual way. if instead a corona is responsible for the x-rays, the systemmight be a large-scale analog of the galactic black holes in the transientintermediate state.

astro-ph;0701023	spectral variability analysis of an xmm-newton observation of ark 564	we present a spectral variability analysis of the x-ray emission of thenarrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ark 564 using the data from a  ~100 ks xmm-newton observation. taking advantage of the high sensitivity ofthis long observation and the simple spectral shape of ark 564, we determineaccurately the spectral variability patterns in the source.  we use standard cross-correlation methods to investigate the correlationsbetween the soft and hard energy band light curves. we also generated 200energy spectra from data stretches of 500 s duration each and fitted each oneof them with a power law plus a bremsstrahlung component (for the soft excess)and we investigated the correlations between the various best fit modelparameter values. the ``power law plus bremsstrahlung'' model describes thespectrum well at all times. the iron line and the absorption features, whichare found in the time-averaged spectrum of the source are too weak to effectthe results of the time resolved spectral fits. we find that the power law andthe soft excess flux are variable, on all measured time scales. the power lawslope is also variable, and leads the flux variations of both the power law andthe bremsstrahlung components. our results can be explained in the framework oftime-dependent comptonization models. they are consistent with a picture whereinstabilities propagate through an extended x-ray source, affecting first thesoft and then the hard photons producing regions. the soft excess couldcorrespond to ionized disc reflection emission, in which case it responds fastto the primary continuum variations. the time scales are such that light traveltimes might additionally influence the observed variability structure.

astro-ph;0701809	fourier-resolved spectroscopy of agn using xmm-newton data: i. the 3-10  kev band results	we present the results from the fourier resolved spectroscopy of archivalxmm-newton data of five agn, namely, mrk 766, ngc 3516, ngc 3783, ngc 4051 andark 564. this work supplements the earlier study of mcg-6-30-15 as well asthose of several galactic black hole candidate sources. our results exhibitmuch larger diversity than those of galactic sources, a fact we attribute tothe diversity of their masses. when we take into account this effect andcombine our results with those from cyg x-1, it seems reasonable to concludethat, at high frequencies, the slope of the fourier-resolved spectra inaccreting black hole systems decreases with increasing frequency asproportional to f^{-0.25}, irrespective of whether the system is in its high orlow state. this result implies that the flux variations in agn are accompaniedby complex spectral slope variations as well. we also find that the fe ka linein mrk 766, ngc 3783 and ngc 4051 is variable on time scales ~day - 1 hour. theiron fluorescence line is absent in the spectra of the highest frequencies,andthere is an indication that, just like in cyg x-1, the equivalent width of theline in the fourier-resolved of agn decreases with increasing frequency.

astro-ph;9905104	the swansong in context: long-timescale x-ray variability of ngc 4051	on 9-11 may 1998, the highly-variable, low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxyngc4051 was observed in an unusual low flux state by bepposax (guainazzi et al.1998) rxte and euve. we present fits of the 4-15 kev rxte spectrum and bepposaxmecs spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with theinterpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum ofpure reflection from distant cold matter. we place this result in context byshowing the x-ray lightcurve of ngc4051 obtained by our rxte monitoringcampaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low statelasted for ~150 days before the may observations (implying that the reflectingmaterial is &gt; 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of alightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux overtimescales &gt; months. we show that the long-timescale component to x-rayvariability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct fromthe variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations inthe accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. as the sourceapproaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. ngc4051may represent a microcosm of all x-ray variability in radio quiet activegalactic nuclei (agns), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states andvariability properties which more luminous agns may pass through on timescalesof decades to thousands of years.
