0901.0419	modeling and reproducibility of suzaku hxd pin/gso background	suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) achieved the lowest background level thanany other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energyrange of 10--600 kev, by utilizing pin photodiodes and gso scintillatorsmounted in the bgo active shields to reject particle background andcompton-scattered events as much as possible. because it does not have imagingcapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity islimited by the reproducibility of the non x-ray background (nxb) model. wemodeled the hxd nxb, which varies with time as well as other satellites with alow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitorcounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. the model background issupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated byrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. thereproducibility of the nxb model depends on the event selection criteria (suchas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigmasystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (pin 15--40 kev) and 1% (gso50--100 kev) for more than 10 ksec exposure.

0901.4626	a galaxy merger scenario for the ngc 1550 galaxy from metal  distributions in the x-ray emitting plasma	the elliptical galaxy ngc 1550 at a redshift of $z=0.01239$, identified withan extended x-ray source rx j0419+0225, was observed with {\it xmm-newton} for31 ks. from the x-ray data and archival near infra-red data of two micron allsky survay, we derive the profiles of components constituting the ngc 1550system; the gas mass, total mass, metal mass, and galaxy luminosity. the metals(oxygen, silicon, and iron) are extended to $\sim 200$ kpc from the center,wherein $\sim$ 70% of the $k$-band luminosity is carried by ngc 1550 itself. asfirst revealed with {\it asca}, the data reconfirms the presence of a darkhalo, of which the mass ($1.6 \times 10^{13} m_{\odot}$) is typical of a galaxygroup rather than of a single galaxy. within 210 kpc, the $k$-bandmass-to-light ratio reaches $75 m_{\odot}/l_{\odot}$, which is comparable tothose of clusters of galaxies. the iron-mass-to-light ratio profile (silicon-and oxygen mass-to-light ratio profiles as well) exhibits about two orders ofmagnitude decrease toward the center. further studies comparing mass densitiesof metals with those of the other cluster components reveal that the iron (aswell as silicon) in the icm traces very well the total gravitating mass,whereas the stellar component is significantly more concentrated to withinseveral tens kpc of the ngc 1550 nucleus. thus, in the central region, theamount of metals is significantly depleted for the luminous galaxy light. amonga few possible explanations of this effect, the most likely scenario is thatgalaxies in this system were initially much more extended than today, andgradually fell to the center and merged into ngc 1550.

0902.3658	a suzaku search for non-thermal emission at hard x-ray energies in the  coma cluster	the brightest cluster radio halo known resides in the coma cluster ofgalaxies. the relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotronemission should also produce inverse compton emission that becomes competitivewith thermal emission from the icm at hard x-ray energies. thus far, claimeddetections of this emission in coma are controversial (fusco-femiano et al.2004; rossetti &amp; molendi 2004). we present a suzaku hxd-pin observation of thecoma cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard x-ray content. thecontribution of thermal emission to the hxd-pin spectrum is constrained bysimultaneously fitting thermal and non-thermal models to it and a spatiallyequivalent spectrum derived from an xmm-newton mosaic of the coma field(schuecker et al. 2004). we fail to find statistically significant evidence fornon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only asingle or multi-temperature model for the icm. including systematicuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emissionof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 kev, for photon index of 2.0), which implies alower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of b&gt;0.15 microg. our fluxupper limit is 2.5x lower than the detected non-thermal flux from rxte(rephaeli &amp; gruber 2002) and bepposax (fusco-femiano et al. 2004). however, ifthe non-thermal hard x-ray emission in coma is more spatially extended than theobserved radio halo, the suzaku hxd-pin may miss some fraction of the emission.a detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might goundetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections. thethermal interpretation of the hard coma spectrum is consistent with recentanalyses of integral (eckert et al. 2007) and swift (ajello et al. 2009) data.

0909.1358	suzaku observation of the radio halo cluster abell 2319: gas dynamics  and hard x-ray properties	we present the results of suzaku observation of the radio halo cluster abell2319. the metal abundance in the central cool region is found to be higher thanthe surrounding region, which was not resolved in the former studies. weconfirm that the line-of-sight velocities of the intracluster medium in theobserved region are consistent with those of the member galaxies of entirea2319 and a2319a subgroup for the first time, though any velocity differencewithin the region is not detected. on the other hand, we do not find any signsof gas motion relevant to a2319b subgroup. hard x-ray emission from the clusteris clearly detected, but its spectrum is likely thermal. assuming a simplesingle temperature model for the thermal component, we find that the upperlimit of the non-thermal inverse compton component becomes $2.6 \times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 10-40 kev band, which means that thelower limit of the magnetic field is 0.19 $\mu$g with the radio spectral index0.92. although the results slightly depend on the detailed spectral modeling,it is robust that the upper limit of the power-law component flux and lowerlimit of the magnetic field strength become $\sim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim 0.2 \mu$g, respectively. considering the lack of asignificant amount of very hot ($\sim 20$ kev) gas and the strong bulk flowmotion, it is more likely that the relativistic non-thermal electronsresponsible for the radio halo are accelerated through the intraclusterturbulence rather than the shocks.

0911.5205	suzaku constraints on the soft and hard excess emissions from abell 2199	the nearby ($z=0.03015$) cluster of galaxies abell~2199 was observed bysuzaku in x-rays, with five pointings for $\sim 20$ ks each. from the xis data,the temperature and metal abundance profiles were derived out to $\sim 700$ kpc(0.4 times virial radius). both these quantities decrease gradually from thecenter to peripheries by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the oxygen abundance tendsto be flat. the temperature within 12' ($\sim 430$ kpc) is $\sim 4$ kev, andthe 0.5--10 kev x-ray luminosity integrated up to 30' is $(2.9 \pm 0.1) \times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous xmm-newton measurements.above this thermal emission, no significant excess was found either in the xisrange below $\sim 1$ kev, or in the hxd-pin range above $\sim 15$ kev. the90%-confidence upper limit on the emission measure of an assumed 0.2 kev warmgas is (3.7--7.5) $\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, which is 3.7--7.6times tighter than the detection reported with xmm-newton. the 90%-confidenceupper limit on the 20--80 kev luminosity of any power law component is $1.8\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, assuming a photon index of 2.0. although thisupper limit does not reject the possible 2.1$\sigma$ detection by the bepposaxpds, it is a factor of 2.1 tighter than that of the pds if both are consideredupper limits. the non-detection of the hard excess can be reconciled with theupper limit on diffuse radio emission, without invoking the very low magneticfields ($&lt; 0.073 \mu$g) which were suggested previously.

1002.4811	suzaku observation of abell 1689: anisotropic temperature and entropy  distributions associated with the large-scale structure	(abridged) we present results of suzaku observations of the intraclustermedium (icm) in abell 1689, combined with complementary analysis of the sdssdata and weak and strong lensing analysis of subaru/suprime-cam and hst/acsobservations. faint x-ray emission from the icm around the virial radius isdetected at 4.0 sigma significance. we find anisotropic gas temperature andentropy distributions in cluster outskirts correlated with large-scalestructure of galaxies. the high temperature and entropy region in thenortheastern (ne) outskirts is connected to an overdense filamentary structure.the outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gastemperatures and entropies, deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium. theseresults suggest that thermalization of the icm occurs faster along thefilamentary structures than the void regions. a joint x-ray and lensinganalysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is $\sim60-90%$ of spherical lensingone but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors in $0.6r_{2500} \simltr \simlt 0.8r_{500}$, and that it is significantly biased as low as $\simlt60%$within $0.4r_{2500}$, irrespective of mass models. the thermal gas pressurewithin $r_{500}$ is, at most, $\sim50$--60% of the total pressure to balancefully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass, and $\sim30$--40% around thevirial radius. although these constitute lower limits when one considers thepossible halo triaxiality, these small relative contributions of thermalpressure would require additional sources of pressure, such as bulk and/orturbulent motions.

0708.2002	measuring the broad-band x-ray spectrum from 400 ev to 40 kev in the  southwest part of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we report on results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thesouthwest part of the galactic supernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946 with anenergy coverage of 0.4-40 kev. the x-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotronorigin, is known to be completely lineless, making this snr ideally suited fora detailed study of the x-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particleacceleration at high speed shocks. with a sensitive hard x-ray measurement fromthe hxd pin on board suzaku, we determine the hard x-ray spectrum in the 12--40kev range to be described by a power law with photon index gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,significantly steeper than the soft x-ray index of gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measuredpreviously with asca and other missions. we find that a simple power law failsto describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 kev and instead a power-law withan exponential cutoff with hard index gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energycutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 kev formally provides an excellent fit over thefull bandpass. if we use the so-called srcut model, as an alternative model, itgives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 kev.together with the tev gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 tev obtainedrecently by hess observations, our suzaku observations of rx j1713.7-3946provide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in asupernova shock.

(2003) and a single-temperatureplasma model are adopted, o, mg, si, s, and fe show similar abundances: 0.4-0.6solar within 0.02-0.2 r180. this fe abundance is similar to those at 0.1-0.2r180 in rich clusters and other groups of galaxies. at 0.2-0.3 r180, the feabundance becomes 0.2-0.3 solar. a two-temperature plasma model yields icmabundances that are higher by a factor of 1.2-1.5, but gives similar abundanceratios among o, mg, si, s, and fe. the northern region has a lower icmtemperature and higher brightness and fe abundance, whereas the southern regionhas a higher icm temperature and lower brightness and fe abundance. theseresults indicate that the cd galaxy may have traveled from the north because ofrecent dynamical evolution. the cumulative oxygen- and iron-mass-to-lightratios within 0.3 r180 are more than an order of magnitude lower than those ofrich clusters and some relaxed groups of galaxies. past dynamical evolutionmight have hindered the strong concentration of hot gas in the fornax cluster'scentral region. scatter in the imlr and similarity in the element abundances inthe icm of groups and clusters of galaxies indicate early metal synthesis.

1109.0154	suzaku observations of iron k-lines from the intracluster medium of the  coma cluster	the coma cluster was observed with an x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis)onboard suzaku in six pointings, including the central x-ray peak region, the14'west offset region, 30'and 34'north-west offset regions, and 44'and60'south-west offset regions. owing to its lower background level, suzaku hasbetter sensitivity to fe k-alpha lines than other satellites. using precise feline measurements, we studied the temperature structure, possible bulk motions,and iron abundance distributions in the intracluster medium (icm). the observedspectra were well-represented by a single-temperature model, and two- or three-temperature model did not improve chi-square substantially. the temperature,derived from k-alpha line ratios of h-like and he-like fe, agree with thosederived from the single-temperature model. because the line ratio is a steepfunction of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperaturemeasurements conducted with suzaku. within the 34'region, the redshift derivedfrom the central energy of the he-like fe line is consistent with that fromoptical observations, within a calibration error of 18 ev or 818 km/s in theline of sight. this value is smaller than the sound velocity of icm, which is1500 km/s. the central energy of fe lines at the 44'offset region around thengc 4839 subcluster is also consistent with those within the 34'region. theseresults on the temperature and velocity structure suggest that the core of thecluster is in a relaxed state, and non-thermal electrons relevant to the radiohalo are accelerated by intracluster turbulence rather than large-scale shocks.fe abundance is almost constant at 0.4 solar within the 34'region, anddecreases with radius. this value is slightly lower than those of otherclusters, which means the gas have been mixed well during a past mergerassociated with the growth of the cluster.

1109.0457	suzaku studies of wide-band spectral variability of the bright type i  seyfert galaxy markarian 509	the type i seyfert galaxy markarian 509 was observed with suzaku in 2010november, for a gross time span of 2.2 days. timing and spectral properties ofthe 0.5-45 kev x-rays, detected with the xis and hxd, consistently revealed thepresence of a soft spectral component that remained constant while the total x-ray intensity varied by \pm10%. this stable soft component, found in the0.5-3.0 kev range, was interpreted as a result of thermal comptonization in acorona with a temperature of ~ 0.5 kev and an optical depth of ~ 18. thetime-avearged 0.5-45 kev suzaku spectrum was reproduced successfully, as acombination of this thermal comptonization component, a harder power-law ofphoton index ~ 1.8, moderate reflection, and an iron k-emission line. byanalyzing four archival suzaku datasets of the same object obtained in 2006,the thermal comptonization component, which was stable during the 2.2 daypointing in 2010, was found to vary on time scales of a few weeks,independently of the power-law component. implications of these results arediscussed in terms of the "multi-zone comptonization" view, obtained withsuzaku from the black hole binary cygnus x-1.

1112.5955	x-ray view of the shock front in the merging cluster abell 3376 with  suzaku	we report on a suzaku measurement of the shock feature associated with thewestern radio relic in the merging cluster a3376. the temperature profile ischaracterized by an almost flat radial shape with kt ~ 4 kev within 0.5 r200and a rise by about 1 kev inside the radio relic. across the relic region(0.6-0.8 r200), the temperature shows a remarkable drop from about 4.7 kev to1.3 kev. this is a clear evidence that the radio relic really corresponds to ashock front possibly caused by a past major merger. the observed sharp changesof the temperature and electron density indicate the mach number m~3. theradial entropy profile is flatter than the prediction (r^1.1) of numericalsimulations within 0.5 r200}, and becomes steeper around the relic region.these observed features and time-scale estimation consistently imply that theicm around the radio relic has experienced a merger shock and is in the middleof the process of dynamical and thermal relaxation.

1201.5891	accretion geometry of the low-mass x-ray binary aquila x-1 in the soft  and hard states	the neutron-star low-mass x-ray binary aquila x-1 was observed seven times intotal with the suzaku x-ray observatory from september 28 to october 30 in2007, in the decaying phase of an outburst. in order to constrain theflux-dependent accretion geometry of this source over wider energy bands thanemployed in most of previous works, the present study utilized two out of theseven data sets. the 0.8-31 kev spectrum on september 28, taken with the xisand hxd-pin for an exposure of 13.8 ks, shows an absorbed 0.8-31 kev flux of$3.6\times 10^{-9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, together with typicalcharacteristics of the soft state of this type of objects. the spectrum wassuccessfully explained by an optically-thick disk emission plus a comptonizedblackbody component. although these results are in general agreement withprevious studies, the significance of a hard tail recently reported using thesame data was inconclusive in our analysis. the spectrum acquired on october 9for an exposure of 19.7 ks was detected over a 0.8-100 kev band with the xis,hxd-pin, and hxd-gso, at an absorbed flux of $8.5\times 10^{-10}$ erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ (in 0.8-100 kev). it shows characteristics of the hard state, and wassuccessfully explained by the same two continuum components but with ratherdifferent parameters including much stronger thermal comptonization, of whichthe seed photon source was identified with blackbody emission from theneutron-star surface. as a result, the accretion flow in the hard state isinferred to take a form of an optically-thick and geometrically-thin disk downto a radius of $21\pm 4$ km from the neutron star, and then turn into anoptically-thin nearly-spherical hot flow.

1202.3196	two-phase icm in the central region of the rich cluster of galaxies  abell 1795: a joint chandra, xmm-newton, and suzaku view	based on a detailed analysis of the high-quality chandra, xmm-newton, andsuzaku data of the x-ray bright cluster of galaxies abell 1795, we report clearevidence for a two-phase intracluster medium (icm) structure, which consists ofa cool (with a temperature t = 2.0-2.2 kev) and a hot (t = 5.0-5.7 kev)component that coexist and dominate the x-ray emission at least in the central80 kpc. a third weak emission component (t = 0.8 kev) is also detected withinthe innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of inter-stellar medium(ism) of the cd galaxy. deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radialtemperature distributions for both the hot phase and cool phase components.these results are consistent with the asca measurements reported in xu et al.(1998), and resemble the previous findings for the centaurus cluster (e.g.,takahashi et al. 2009). by analyzing the emission measure ratio and gas metalabundance maps created from the chandra data, we find that the cool phasecomponent is more metal-enriched than the hot phase one in 50-100 kpc region,which agrees with that found in m87 (simionescu et al. 2008). the coexistenceof the cool phase and hot phase icm cannot be realized by bubble uplifting fromactive galactic nuclei (agn) alone. instead, the two-phase icm properties arebetter reconciled with a cd corona model (makishima et al. 2001).

1203.1700	suzaku observations of the hydra a cluster out to the virial radius	we report suzaku observations of the northern half of the hydra a cluster outto ~1.4 mpc, reaching the virial radius. this is the first suzaku observationsof a medium-size (kt ~3 kev) cluster out to the virial radius. two observationswere conducted, north-west and north-east offsets, which continue in a filamentdirection and a void direction of the large-scale structure of the universe,respectively. the x-ray emission and distribution of galaxies elongate in thefilament direction. the temperature profiles in the two directions are mostlyconsistent with each other within the error bars and drop to 1.5 kev at 1.5r_500. as observed by suzaku in hot clusters, the entropy profile becomesflatter beyond r_500, in disagreement with the r^1.1 relationship that isexpected from accretion shock heating models. when scaled with the averageintracluster medium (icm) temperature, the entropy profiles of clustersobserved with suzaku are universal and do not depend on system mass. thehydrostatic mass values in the void and filament directions are in goodagreement, and the navarro, frenk, and white universal mass profile representsthe hydrostatic mass distribution up to ~ 2 r_500. beyond r_500, the ratio ofgas mass to hydrostatic mass exceeds the result of the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe, and at r_100, these ratios in the filament and voiddirections reach 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. we discuss possible deviations fromhydrostatic equilibrium at cluster outskirts. we derived radial profiles of thegasmass- to-light ratio and iron-mass-to-light ratio out to the virial radius.within r_500, the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the hydra a cluster was comparedwith those in other clusters observed with suzaku.

1204.6393	suzaku observation of abell 1555 and abell 1558: searching for  non-thermal emission from large scale structure formation	we report x-ray observations of two galaxy clusters abell 1555 and abell 1558with suzaku, which are included in a large scale filamentary structure and asupercluster, to search for non-thermal emission driven by shocks produced instructure formation. these two clusters are detected by suzaku/xis for thefirst time in the x-ray band of 0.5-7 kev. no significant flux is detected byhxd in the energy band of 13-40 kev, and upper limits are reported. from theanalysis of the xis data, we find that the spectrum of a1555 is fit by athermal plus power-law model, significantly better than a single-temperaturepure thermal spectrum. if this power-law component is due to inverse-comptonscattering, the fraction of total baryon energy imparted to non-thermalelectrons is consistent with the typical value inferred from the observation ofother clusters. however, other scenarios (e.g., under lying agns,multi-temperature thermal models) cannot be excluded and further investigationof this system is desired. basic physical properties of a1555 (e.g., totalmass) are also reported.

1205.1574	broad-band spectral analysis of the galactic ridge x-ray emission	detailed spectral analysis of the galactic x-ray background emission, or thegalactic ridge x-ray emission (grxe), is presented. to study the origin of theemission, broad-band and high-quality grxe spectra were produced from 18pointing observations with suzaku in the galactic bulge region, with the totalexposure of 1 ms. the spectra were successfully fitted by a sum of two majorspectral components; a spectral model of magnetic accreting white dwarfs with amass of 0.66 (0.59-0.75) solar, and a softer optically-thin thermal emissionwith a plasma temperature of 1.2-1.5 kev which is attributable to coronal x-raysources.  when combined with previous studies which employed high spatial resolution ofthe chandra satellite (e.g. revnivtsev et al. 2009, nature), the presentspectroscopic result gives another strong support to a scenario that the grxeis essentially an assembly of numerous discrete faint x-ray stars.  the detected grxe flux in the hard x-ray band was used to estimate the numberdensity of the unresolved hard x-ray sources. when integrated over a luminosityrange of ~10^30-10^34 erg/s, the result is consistent with a value which wasreported previously by directly resolving faint point sources.

0711.1454	suzaku observation of hcg 62: temperature, abundance, and extended hard  x-ray emission profiles	we present results of 120 ks observation of a compact group of galaxieshcg~62 ($z=0.0145$) with suzaku xis and hxd-pin\@. the xis spectra for fourannular regions were fitted with two temperature {\it vapec} model withvariable abundance, combined with the foreground galactic component. thegalactic component was constrained to have a common surface brightness amongthe four annuli, and two temperature {\it apec} model was preferred to singletemperature model. we confirmed the multi-temperature nature of the intra-groupmedium reported with chandra and xmm-newton, with a doughnut-like hightemperature ring at radii 3.3--6.5$'$ in a hardness image. we found mg, si, s,and fe abundances to be fairly robust. we examined the possible``high-abundance arc'' at $\sim 2'$ southwest from the center, however suzakudata did not confirm it. we suspect that it is a misidentification of an excesshot component in this region as the fe line. careful background study showed nopositive detection of the extended hard x-rays previously reported with asca,in 5--12 kev with xis and 12--40 kev with hxd-pin, although our upper limit didnot exclude the asca result. there is an indication that the x-ray intensity in$r&lt;3.3'$ region is $70\pm 19$% higher than the nominal cxb level (5--12 kev),and chandra and suzaku data suggest that most of this excess could be due toconcentration of hard x-ray sources with an average photon index of$\gamma=1.38\pm 0.06$. cumulative mass of o, fe and mg in the group gas and themetal mass-to-light ratio were derived and compared with those in other groups.possible role of agn or galaxy mergers in this group is also discussed.

1208.3536	the nature of the stable soft x-ray emissions in several types of active  galactic nuclei observed by suzaku	to constrain the origin of the soft x-ray excess phenomenon seen in manyactive galactic nuclei, the intensity-correlated spectral analysis, developedby noda et al. (2011b) for markarian 509, was applied to wide-band (0.5-45 kev)suzaku data of five representative objects with relatively weak reflectionsignature. they are the typical bare-nucleus type 1 seyfert fairall 9, thebright and typical type 1.5 seyfert mcg-2-58-22, 3c382 which is one of thex-ray brightest broad line radio galaxies, the typical seyfert-like radio loudquasar 4c+74.26, and the x-ray brightest radio quiet quasar mr2251-178. in allof them, soft x-ray intensities in energies below 3 kev were tightly correlatedwith that in 3-10 kev, but with significant positive offsets. these offsets,when calculated in finer energy bands, define a stable soft component in 0.5-3kev. in each object, this component successfully explained the soft excessabove a power-law fit. these components were interpreted in several alternativeways, including a thermal comptonization component which is independent of thedominant power-law emission. this interpretation, considered physically mostreasonable, is discussed from a viewpoint of multi-zone comptonization, whichwas proposed for the black hole binary cygnus x-1 (makishima et al. 2008).

1302.0095	suzaku observations of abell 1835 outskirts: deviation from hydrostatic  equilibrium	we present results of four-pointing suzaku x-ray observations (total ~200 ks)of the intracluster medium (icm) in the abell 1835 galaxy cluster (kt ~ 8 kev,z = 0.253) out to the virial radius (r_vir ~ 2.9 mpc) and beyond. faint x-rayemission from the icm out to r_vir is detected. the temperature graduallydecreases with radius from ~8 kev in the inner region to ~2 kev at r_vir. theentropy profile is shown to flatten beyond r_500, in disagreement with ther_1.1 dependence predicted from the accretion shock heating model. the thermalpressure profile in the range 0.3r_500 &lt; r &lt; r_vir agrees well with thatobtained from the stacked sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations with theplanck satellite. the hydrostatic mass profile in the cluster outskirts (r_500&lt; r &lt; r_vir) falls well short of the weak lensing one derived fromsubaru/suprime-cam observations, showing an unphysical decrease with radius.the gas mass fraction at r_vir defined with the lensing total mass agrees withthe cosmic baryon fraction from the wmap 7-year data. all these resultsindicate, rather than the gas-clumping effect, that the bulk of the icm in thecluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matterretained some of its kinetic energy. finally, combining with our recent suzakuand lensing analysis of abell 1689, a cluster of similar mass, temperature, andredshift, we show that the cluster temperature distribution in the outskirts issignificantly correlated with the galaxy density field in the surroundinglarge-scale environment at (1-2)r_vir.

1303.0118	probing of the interactions between the hot plasmas and galaxies in  clusters from z=0.1 to 0.9	based on optical and x-ray data for a sample of 34 relaxed rich clusters ofgalaxies with redshifts of 0.1-0.9, we studied relative spatial distributionsof the two major baryon contents, the cluster galaxies and the hot plasmas.using multi-band photometric data taken with the uh88 telescope, we determinedthe integrated (two dimensional) radial light profiles of member galaxies ineach cluster using two independent approaches, i.e., the background subtractionand the color-magnitude filtering. the icm mass profile of each cluster in oursample, also integrated in two dimensions, was derived from aspatially-resolved spectral analysis using xmm-newton and chandra data. then,the radially-integrated light profile of each cluster was divided by its icmmass profile, to obtain a profile of "galaxy light vs. icm mass ratio". theratio profiles over the central 0.65 r500 regions were found to steepen fromthe higher- to lower- redshift subsamples, meaning that the galaxies becomemore concentrated in the icm sphere towards lower redshifts. the evolution isalso seen in galaxy number vs. icm mass ratio profiles. a range of systematicuncertainties in the galaxy light measurements, as well as manyradius-/redshift- dependent biases to the galaxy vs. icm profiles have beenassessed, but none of them is significant against the observed evolution.besides, the galaxy light vs. total mass ratio profiles also exhibit gradualconcentration towards lower redshift. we interpret in the context that thegalaxies, the icm, and the dark matter components followed a similar spatialdistribution in the early phase (z&gt;0.5), while the galaxies have fallen towardsthe center relative to the others at a later phase.

1308.5760	multi-wavelength studies of spectacular ram pressure stripping of a  galaxy: discovery of an x-ray absorption feature	we report the detection of an x-ray absorption feature near the galaxy m86 inthe virgo cluster. the absorber has a column density of 2-3 e20 /cm^2, and itsposition coincides with the peak of an intracluster hi cloud which was removedfrom the galaxy ngc 4388 presumably by ram pressure. these results indicatethat the hi cloud is located in front of m86 along the line-of-sight, andsuggest that the stripping was primarily created by an interaction between ngc4388 and the hot plasmas of the virgo cluster, not the m86 halo. by calculatingan x-ray temperature map, we further detected an x-ray counterpart of the hicloud up to about 3' south of m86. it has a temperature of 0.89 kev and a massof ~4.5 e8 solar mass, exceeding the estimated hi gas mass. the highhot-to-cold gas ratio in the cloud indicates a significant evaporation of thehi gas, probably by thermal conduction from the hotter cluster plasma with asub-spitzer rate.

1308.6053	multi-wavelength studies of spectacular ram pressure stripping of a  galaxy. ii. star formation in the tail	with multiband photometric data in public archives, we detected fourintracluster star-forming regions in the virgo cluster. two of them were at aprojected distance of 35 kpc away from ngc4388, and the other two were 66 kpcaway. our new spectroscopic observation revealed that their recessionvelocities were comparable to the ram-pressure-stripped tail of ngc4388 andconfirmed their association. the stellar mass of the star-forming regionsranged from 10^4 - 10^4.5 m_sun except for that of the faintest one which wouldbe &lt;10^3 m_sun. the metallicity was comparable to the solar abundance, and theage of the stars was ~ 10^6.8 years. their young stellar age meant that thestar formation should have started after the gas was stripped from ngc4388.this implied in situ condensation of the stripped gas. we also found that twostar-forming regions lay near the leading edge of a filamentary dark cloud. theextinction of the filament was smaller than that derived from the balmerdecrement of the star-forming regions. it implied that the dust in the filamentwould be locally dense around the star-forming regions.

1310.3349	discovery of an outstanding disk in the cd galaxy of the hydra a cluster	the central cd galaxy of the hydra a cluster has one of the most powerfulactive galactic nuclei (agns) in the nearby universe (z &lt;0.2). we report on thediscovery of a dust lane in the cd galaxy using subaru telescope. the i'-bandimage shows the existence of a dark band of the size of 3.6"x 0.7" (4 kpc x 0.8kpc), which appears to be quite similar to the dust lane observed in centaurusa. the morphology indicates that the cold disk that seen as the dust lane isalmost edge-on and rotates around the agn. since the minor axis of the dustlane is nearly parallel to the radio jets emerging from the agn, the disk isprobably feeding its gas into the central black hole. from the absorption, weestimate the hydrogen column density of the lane is n_h=2.0 x 10^21 cm^-2, andthe mass of the disk is ~8 x 10^7 m_sun. the column density is consistent withconstraints obtained from chandra x-ray observations. the age of the disk is &gt;~4 x 10^7 yr. the position angle of the disk and the galaxy's photometric axisare misaligned, which may imply that the cold gas in the disk is brought viagalaxy mergers. our observations may indicate that the supply of cold gas bygalaxy mergers is required for the most intensive feedback from agns.

1507.00876	a study of active shielding optimized for 1-80 kev wide-band x-ray  detector in space	active shielding is an effective technique to reduce background signals inhard x-ray detectors and to enable observing darker sources with highsensitivity in space. usually the main detector is covered with some shielddetectors made of scintillator crystals such as bgo (bi$_4$ge$_3$o$_{12}$), andthe background signals are filtered out using anti-coincidence among them.japanese x-ray observing satellites "suzaku" and "astro-h" employed thistechnique in their hard x-ray instruments observing at &gt; 10 kev.  in the next generation x-ray satellites, such as the nghxt proposal, a singlehybrid detector is expected to cover both soft (1-10 kev) and hard (&gt; 10 kev)x-rays for effectiveness. however, present active shielding is not optimizedfor the soft x-ray band, 1-10 kev. for example, bi and ge, which are containedin bgo, have their fluorescence emission lines around 10 kev. these linesappear in the background spectra obtained by astro-h hard x-ray imager, whichare non-negligible in its observation energy band of 5-80 kev.  we are now optimizing the design of active shields for both soft and hardx-rays at the same time. as a first step, we utilized a bgo crystal as adefault material, and measured the l lines of bi and k lines of ge from itusing the x-ray soipix, "xrpix".

0805.3582	constraint of non-thermal x-ray emission from the on-going merger  cluster abell 3376 with suzaku	clusters of galaxies are among the best candidates for particle accelerationsources in the universe, a signature of which is non-thermal hard x-rayemission from the accelerated relativistic particles. we present early resultson suzaku observations of non-thermal emission from abell 3376, which is anearby on-going merger cluster. suzaku observed the cluster twice, focusing onthe cluster center containing the diffuse radio emission to the east, andcluster peripheral region to the west. for both observations, we detect noexcess hard x-ray emission above the thermal cluster emission. an upper limiton the non-thermal x-ray flux of $2.1\times10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$(15--50 kev) at the 3$\sigma$ level from a $34\times34$ arcmin$^2$ region,derived with the hard x-ray detector (hxd), is similar to that obtained withthe bepposax/pds. using the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) data, the upperlimit on the non-thermal emission from the west relic is independentlyconstrained to be $&lt;1.1\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (4$-$8 kev) atthe 3$\sigma$ level from a 122 arcmin$^2$ region. assuming compton scatteringbetween relativistic particles and the cosmic microwave background (cmb)photons, the intracluster magnetic field $b$ is limited to be $&gt;0.03\mu$g (hxd)and $&gt;0.10\mu$g (xis).

1509.00588	the si/cdte semiconductor compton camera of the astro-h soft gamma-ray  detector (sgd)	the soft gamma-ray detector (sgd) is one of the instrument payloads onboardastro-h, and will cover a wide energy band (60--600 kev) at a background level10 times better than instruments currently in orbit. the sgd achieves lowbackground by combining a compton camera scheme with a narrow field-of-viewactive shield. the compton camera in the sgd is realized as a hybridsemiconductor detector system which consists of silicon and cadmium telluride(cdte) sensors. the design of the sgd compton camera has been finalized and thefinal prototype, which has the same configuration as the flight model, has beenfabricated for performance evaluation. the compton camera has overalldimensions of 12 cm x 12 cm x 12 cm, consisting of 32 layers of si pixelsensors and 8 layers of cdte pixel sensors surrounded by 2 layers of cdte pixelsensors. the detection efficiency of the compton camera reaches about 15% and3% for 100 kev and 511 kev gamma rays, respectively. the pixel pitch of the siand cdte sensors is 3.2 mm, and the signals from all 13312 pixels are processedby 208 asics developed for the sgd. good energy resolution is afforded bysemiconductor sensors and low noise asics, and the obtained energy resolutionswith the prototype si and cdte pixel sensors are 1.0--2.0 kev (fwhm) at 60 kevand 1.6--2.5 kev (fwhm) at 122 kev, respectively. this results in goodbackground rejection capability due to better constraints on comptonkinematics. compton camera energy resolutions achieved with the final prototypeare 6.3 kev (fwhm) at 356 kev and 10.5 kev (fwhm) at 662 kev, respectively,which satisfy the instrument requirements for the sgd compton camera (betterthan 2%). moreover, a low intrinsic background has been confirmed by thebackground measurement with the final prototype.

1509.07668	the first demonstration of the concept of "narrow-fov si/cdte  semiconductor compton camera"	the soft gamma-ray detector (sgd), to be deployed onboard the {\it astro-h}satellite, has been developed to provide the highest sensitivity observationsof celestial sources in the energy band of 60-600~kev by employing a detectorconcept which uses a compton camera whose field-of-view is restricted by a bgoshield to a few degree (narrow-fov compton camera). in this concept, thebackground from outside the fov can be heavily suppressed by constraining theincident direction of the gamma ray reconstructed by the compton camera to beconsistent with the narrow fov. we, for the first time, demonstrate thevalidity of the concept using background data taken during the thermal vacuumtest and the low-temperature environment test of the flight model of sgd onground. we show that the measured background level is suppressed to less than10\% by combining the event rejection using the anti-coincidence trigger of theactive bgo shield and by using compton event reconstruction techniques. morethan 75\% of the signals from the field-of-view are retained against thebackground rejection, which clearly demonstrates the improvement ofsignal-to-noise ratio. the estimated effective area of 22.8~cm$^2$ meets themission requirement even though not all of the operational parameters of theinstrument have been fully optimized yet.

0806.1490	study of nonthermal emission from snr rx j1713.7-3946 with suzaku	we present results obtained from a series of observations of the supernovaremnant rx j1713.7-3946 by the suzaku satellite. the observations cover abouttwo-thirds of the remnant surface. we successfully detected hard x-rays up to ~40 kev from each pointing. the hard x-ray spectra are described by power-lawfunctions with photon indices of ~ 3.0, which are larger than those in theenergy region below 10 kev. connection of the spatially-integrated xis and hxdspectra clearly reveals a spectral cutoff in the 0.4--40 kev x-ray spectrum.this cutoff is interpreted to correspond to the maximum acceleration energy ofelectrons emitting synchrotron radiation. the wide-band coverage of suzaku forthe first time allows us to derive the parent electron spectrum in the cutoffregion, which shows good agreement with theoretical predictions. the inferredcutoff energy in the spatially-integrated x-ray spectrum indicates thatparticle acceleration in the remnant is so efficient that it is almost at thetheoretical limit, the so-called bohm limit. based on the suzaku data, wepresent results of multi-wavelength studies from spectral and morphologicalpoints of view. the spectral energy distribution favors the hadronic scenariorather than the leptonic scenario. for the morphology studies, we compare thesurface brightness maps from the suzaku xis and the h.e.s.s. telescope. weconfirm the strong correlation between x-ray and tev gamma-ray emission. inaddition to the correlation, we found that in the bright western rim regionsthe x-ray emission is brighter than expected from the general x-ray togamma-ray correlation.

astro-ph;0104079	x-ray probing of the central regions of clusters of galaxies	results of asca x-ray study of central regions of medium-richness clusters ofgalaxies are summarized, emphasizing differences between cd and non-cdclusters. the intra-cluster medium (icm) is likely to consist of two (hot andcool) phases within $\sim 100$ kpc of a cd galaxy, where the icm metallicity isalso enhanced. in contrast, the icm in non-cd clusters appears to be isothermalwith little metallicity gradient right to the center. the gravitationalpotential exhibits a hierarchical nesting around cd galaxies, while a totalmass-density profile with a central cusp is indicated for a non-cd clusterabell~1060. the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the icm decreases toward the centerin both types of clusters, although it is radially constant in peripheralregions. the silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in the icm increases with thecluster richness, but remains close to the solar ratio around cd galaxies.these overall results are interpreted without appealing to the popularcooling-flow hypothesis. instead, an emphasis is put on the halo-in-halostructure formed around cd galaxies.

astro-ph;0410126	a prototype si/cdte compton camera and the polarization measurement	a compton camera is the most promising approach for gamma-ray detection inthe energy region from several hundred kev to mev, especially for applicationin high energy astrophysics. in order to obtain good angular resolution,semiconductor detectors such as silicon, germanium and cadmium telluride(cdte)have several advantages over scintillation detectors, which have been used sofar. based on the recent advances of high resolution cdte and silicon imagingdetectors, we are working on a si/cdte compton camera. we have developed64-pixel cdte detectors with a pixel size of 2mmx2mm and double-sided si stripdetectors(dssds) with a position resolution of 800 micron. as a prototypesi/cdte compton camera, we use a dssd as a scatterer and two cdte pixeldetectors as an absorber. in order to verify its performance, we irradiate thecamera with 100% linearly polarised 170kev gamma-rays and demonstrate thesystem works properly as a compton camera. the resolution of the reconstructedscattering angle is 22 degrees(fwhm). measurement of polarization is alsoreported. the polarimetric modulation factor is obtained to be 43%, which isconsistent with the prediction of monte carlo simulations.

astro-ph;0505338	on the temperature profile of radiatively efficient geometrically thin  disks in black hole binaries with the asca gis	x-ray spectra of black hole binaries(bhbs) in the high/soft state werestudied comprehensively by using asca gis data, and partially rxte pca data. amathematical disk model was applied to several bhbs to see if the observedaccretion disk temperature profile was consistent with that expected from thestandard accretion disk model. this model is called p-free disk, and assumesthat the spectrum is composed of multi-temperature blackbody emission of whichthe local temperature t(r) at radius r is given by t(r) ~ r^-p with p being apositive free parameter. the standard disk roughly requires p~3/4, while asmall deviation is expected depending on the inner boundary conditions, generalrelativistic effects and disk vertical structures.our sample objects includedlmc x-1, lmc x-3, xte j2012+381, and gro j1655-40. during the ascaobservations, these bhbs showed characteristics of the standard high/softstate. under the standard modeling of high-state black hole binaries, thesources show tin=0.76-1.17kev, the disk fraction to the total 0.7-10kev flux of54-98%, and nh=(0.7--12)e21/cm^2. the best-fit p-values were found in 0.6-0.8,and the standard value of p=3/4 was accepted for all the sources.the obtainedp-values are also compared with those expected for the standard accretion diskin the schwarzschild metric, and they were consistent with those expected fromthe standard accretion disk.

astro-ph;0609065	suzaku observation of the metallicity distribution in the intracluster  medium of the fornax cluster	the metallicity distribution in the fornax cluster was studied with the xisinstrument onboard the suzaku satellite. k-shell lines of o and mg wereresolved clearly, and the abundances of o, mg, si, s and fe were measured withgood accuracy. the region within a 4' radius of ngc 1399 shows approximatelysolar abundances of fe, si and s, while the o/fe and mg/fe abundance ratios areabout 0.4--0.5 and 0.7 in solar units. in the outer region spanning radiibetween 6' and 23', the fe and si abundances drop to 0.4--0.5 solar and show nosignificant gradient within this region. the abundance ratios, o/fe and mg/fe,are consistent with those in the central region. we also measured the feabundance around ngc 1404 to be approximately solar, and the o, ne and mgabundances to be 0.5--0.7 times the fe level. the significant relativeenhancement of fe within 130 kpc of ngc 1399 and in ngc 1404 indicates anorigin in sn ia, in contrast to the species o, ne, and mg which reflect thestellar metallicity. the mass-to-light ratios for o and fe within 130 kpc ofngc 1399 are over an order of magnitude lower than those in rich clusters,reflecting the metal enrichment history of this poor cluster.

astro-ph;0609560	suzaku observations of the centaurus cluster: absence of bulk motions in  the intracluster medium	the centaurus cluster (z=0.0104) was observed with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) onboard the suzaku x-ray satellite in three pointings, onecentered on the cluster core and the other two offset by +-8' in declination.to search for possible bulk motions of the intracluster medium, the centralenergy of he-like fe-k line (at a rest-frame energy of 6.7 kev) was examined tolook for a positional dependence. over spatial scales of 50 kpc to 140 kpcaround the cluster core, the central line energy was found to be constantwithin the calibration error of 15 ev. the 90% upper limit on the line-of-sightvelocity difference is |delta_v|&lt; 1400 km/s, giving a tighter constraint thanprevious measurements. the significant velocity gradients inferred from aprevious chandra study were not detected between two pairs of rectangularregions near the cluster core. these results suggest that the bulk velocitydoes not largely exceed the thermal velocity of the gas in the central regionof the centaurus cluster. the mean redshift of the intracluster medium wasdetermined to be 0.0097, in agreement with the optical redshift of the clusterwithin the calibration uncertainty. implications of the present results for theestimation of the cluster mass are briefly discussed.
