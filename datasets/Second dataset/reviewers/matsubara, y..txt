0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0908.3301	cangaroo-iii search for tev gamma-rays from two clusters of galaxies	because accretion and merger shocks in clusters of galaxies may accelerateparticles to high energies, clusters are candidate sites for the origin ofultra-high-energy (uhe) cosmic-rays. a prediction was presented for gamma-rayemission from a cluster of galaxies at a detectable level with the currentgeneration of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. the gamma-ray emissionwas produced via inverse compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background(cmb) photons by electron-positron pairs generated by collisions of uhe cosmicrays in the cluster. we observed two clusters of galaxies, abell 3667 and abell4038, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission with the cangaroo-iiiatmospheric cherenkov telescope system in 2006. the analysis showed nosignificant excess around these clusters, yielding upper limits on thegamma-ray emission. from a comparison of the upper limit for the north-westradio relic region of abell 3667 with a model prediction, we derive a lowerlimit for the magnetic field of the region of ~0.1 micro g. this shows thepotential of gamma-ray observations in studies of the cluster environment. wealso discuss the flux upper limit from cluster center regions using a model ofgamma-ray emission from neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions ofcosmic-ray protons with the intra-cluster medium (icm). the derived upper limitof the cosmic-ray energy density within this framework is an order of magnitudehigher than that of our galaxy.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1006.1396	determining the physical lens parameters of the binary gravitational  microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016	we report the result of the analysis of the light curve of the microlensingevent moa-2009-blg-016. the light curve is characterized by a short-durationanomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. we find that the peak anomalyis due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the lightcurve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of theobserver over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the eartharound the sun. in addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finitesize of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure theangular einstein radius of the lens system. the einstein radius combined withthe microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens andthe distance to the lens. we identify three distinct classes of degeneratesolutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of thepreviously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negativeimpact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloidshape of the caustic. we find that, for the best-fit solution, the estimatedmass of the lower-mass component of the binary is (0.04 +- 0.01) m_sun,implying a brown-dwarf companion. however, there exists a solution that isworse only by \delta\chi^2 ~ 3 for which the mass of the secondary is above thehydrogen-burning limit. unfortunately, resolving these two degenerate solutionswill be difficult as the relative lens-source proper motions for both aresimilar and small (~ 1 mas/yr) and thus the lens will remain blended with thesource for the next several decades.

1105.3544	unbound or distant planetary mass population detected by gravitational  microlensing	since 1995, more than 500 exoplanets have been detected using differenttechniques, of which 11 were detected with gravitational microlensing. most ofthese are gravitationally bound to their host stars. there is some evidence offree-floating planetary mass objects in young star-forming regions, but theseobjects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 jupiter masses with largeuncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. here, wereport the discovery of a population of unbound or distant jupiter-massobjects, which are almost twice (1.8_{-0.8}^{+1.7}) as common as main-sequencestars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observationstoward the galactic bulge. these planetary-mass objects have no host stars thatcan be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitationalmicrolensing. however a comparison with constraints from direct imagingsuggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any hoststar. an abrupt change in the mass function at about a jupiter mass favours theidea that their formation process is different from that of stars and browndwarfs. they may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequentlyscattered into unbound or very distant orbits.

1203.4560	planetary and other short binary microlensing events from the moa short  event analysis	we present the analysis of four candidate short duration binary microlensingevents from the 2006-2007 moa project short event analysis. these events werediscovered as a byproduct of an analysis designed to find short timescalesingle lens events that may be due to free-floating planets. three of theseevents are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is mostlikely caused by stellar variability. for each of the three microlensingevents, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature withlittle or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. one of theseevents, moa-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of aplanetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binarymicrolensing effects. the mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x10^{-3} and s = 2.10 +- 0.05, respectively. a bayesian analysis based on astandard galactic model indicates that the planet, moa-bin-1lb, has a mass ofm_p = 3.7 +- 2.1 m_{jup}, and orbits a star of m_* = 0.75{+0.33 -0.41} m_solarat a semi-major axis of a = 8.3 {+4.5 -2.7} au. this is one of the most massiveand widest separation planets found by microlensing. the scarcity of such wideseparation planets also has implications for interpretation of the isolatedplanetary mass objects found by this analysis. if we assume that we have beenable to detect wide separation planets with a efficiency at least as high asthat for isolated planets, then we can set limits on the distribution onplanets in wide orbits. in particular, if the entire isolated planet samplefound by sumi et al. (2011) consists of planets bound in wide orbits aroundstars, we find that it is likely that the median orbital semi-major axis is &gt;30 au.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1207.1244	a possible binary system of a stellar remnant in the high magnification  gravitational microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514	we report the extremely high magnification (a &gt; 1000) binary microlensingevent ogle-2007-blg-514. we obtained good coverage around the double peakstructure in the light curve via follow-up observations from differentobservatories. the binary lens model that includes the effects of parallax(known orbital motion of the earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields abinary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the einstein radius. the parallax parameters allowus to determine the lens distance d_l = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total massm_l=1.40 +/- 0.18 m_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary componentshaving masses of m_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 m_sun and m_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 m_sun,respectively. the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system islikely constructed by the main sequence stars. on the other hand, we used abayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model thatincludes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source arounda companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). theprimary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with m_1 =0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} m_sun and it is at a distance of d_l = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore m_2 =0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} m_sun. the xallarap model implies that the primary lens islikely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a blackhole.

1211.3782	moa-2010-blg-073l: an m-dwarf with a substellar companion at the  planet/brown dwarf boundary	we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event, moa-2010-blg-073,announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on2010-03-18.  this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to bephotometrically variable. analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, wedemonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales &gt;200d. itsdereddened color, $(v-i)_{s,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens modelwe derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $r_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is ared giant star.  we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the eventbut found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part ofthe lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in orderto derive the true parameters of the lensing system.  we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. theeinstein crossing time of the event, $t_{\rm{e}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, wassufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. in addition,the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed theorbital motion of the lens system to be detected. combining the parallax withthe einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,$d_l$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. the primary of thelens is an m-dwarf with $m_{l,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03m_{\odot}$ while the companionhas $m_{l,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0m_{\rm{j}}$ putting it in the boundary zone betweenplanets and brown dwarfs.

1305.0186	the microlensing event rate and optical depth toward the galactic bulge  from moa-ii	we present measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event ratetoward the galactic bulge based on two years of the moa-ii survey. this samplecontains ~1000 microlensing events, with an einstein radius crossing time oft_e &lt; 200 days between -5 &lt;l&lt; 10 degree and -7 &lt;b&lt; -1 degree. our event rateand optical depth analysis uses 474 events with well defined microlensingparameters. in the central fields with |l|&lt; 5 degree, we find an event rates of\gamma = [2.39+/-1.1]e^{[0.60\pm0.05](3-|b|)}x 10^{-5}/star/yr and an opticaldepth of \tau_{200} = [2.35+/-0.18]e^{[0.51+/-0.07](3-|b|)}x 10^{-6} for the427 events using all sources brighter than i_s = 20 mag centered at(l,b)=(0.38, -3.72). we find that the event rate is maximized at low latitudesand a longitude of $l~1 degree. for the 111 events in 3.2 deg^2 of the centralgalactic bulge at |b| &lt; 3.0 degree and 0.0 &lt; l &lt; 2.0, centered at (l,b)=(0.97,-2.26), we find \gamma = 4.57_{-0.46}^{+0.51} x 10^{-5}/star/yr and \tau_{200}= 3.64_{-0.45}^{+ 0.51} x 10^{-6}. we also consider a red clump giant (rcg)star sample with i_s&lt;17.5 mag. our results are consistent with previous opticaldepth measurements. we find that the previously observed difference in opticaldepth measurements between all-source and rcg samples may be largely due tostatistical fluctuations. these event rate measurements towards the centralgalactic bulge are necessary to predict the microlensing event rate and tooptimize the survey fields in the future space mission such as wfirst.

1310.0008	moa-2011-blg-322lb: a "second generation survey" microlensing planet	global "second-generation" microlensing surveys aim to discover andcharacterize extrasolar planets and their frequency, by means ofround-the-clock high-cadence monitoring of a large area of the galactic bulge,in a controlled experiment. we report the discovery of a giant planet inmicrolensing event moa-2011-blg-322. this moderate-magnification event, whichdisplays a clear anomaly induced by a second lensing mass, was inside thefootprint of our second-generation microlensing survey, involving moa, ogle andthe wise observatory. the event was observed by the survey groups, withoutprompting alerts that could have led to dedicated follow-up observations.fitting a microlensing model to the data, we find that the timescale of theevent was t_e=23.2 +/-0.8 days, and the mass ratio between the lens star andits companion is q=0.028 +/-0.001. finite-source effects are marginallydetected, and upper limits on them help break some of the degeneracy in thesystem parameters. using a bayesian analysis that incorporates a galacticstructure model, we estimate the mass of the lens at 0.39 +0.45/-0.19 m_sun, ata distance of 7.56 +/-0.91 kpc. thus, the companion is likely a planet of mass11.6 +13.4/-5.6 m_j, at a projected separation of 4.3 +1.5/-1.2 au, rather farbeyond the snow line. this is the first pure-survey planet reported from asecond-generation microlensing survey, and shows that survey data alone can besufficient to characterize a planetary model. with the detection of additionalsurvey-only planets, we will be able to constrain the frequency of extrasolarplanets near their systems' snow lines.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

0806.0025	a low-mass planet with a possible sub-stellar-mass host in microlensing  event moa-2007-blg-192	we report the detection of an extrasolar planet of mass ratio q ~ 2 x 10^(-4)in microlensing event moa-2007-blg-192. the best fit microlensing model showsboth the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can becombined to obtain the lens masses of m = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) m_sun for theprimary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) m_earth for the planet. however, theobservational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, andthe radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source starcolor measurement. as a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finitesource measurements are weak. nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signalclearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finitesource effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. adaptive opticsimages taken with the very large telescope (vlt) naco instrument are consistentwith a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of themain sequence. follow-up vlt and/or hubble space telescope (hst) observationswill either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-masslens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. in either case, thelens star, moa-2007-blg-192l, is the lowest mass primary known to have acompanion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, moa-2007-blg-192lb, isprobably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest masspulsar planet.

1510.01393	moa-2010-blg-353lb a possible saturn revealed	we report the discovery of a possible planet in microlensing eventmoa-2010-blg-353. this event was only recognised as having a planetary signalafter the microlensing event had finished, and following a systematic analysisof all archival data for binary lens microlensing events collected to date.data for event moa-2010-blg-353 were only recorded by the high cadenceobservations of the ogle and moa survey groups. if we make the assumptions thatthe probability of the lens star hosting a planet of the measured mass ratio isindependent of the lens star mass or distance, and that the source star is inthe galactic bulge, a probability density analysis indicates the planetarysystem comprises a 0.9^{+1.6}_{-0.53} m_{saturn} mass planet orbiting a0.18^{+0.32}_{-0.11} m_{sun} red dwarf star, 6.43^{+1.09}_{-1.15} kpc away. theprojected separation of the planet from the host star is 1.72^{+0.56}_{-0.48}au. under the additional assumption that the source is on the far side of thegalactic bulge, the probability density analysis favours a lens systemcomprising a slightly lighter planet.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.

astro-ph;9905151	on planetary companions to the macho-98-blg-35 microlens star	we present observations of microlensing event macho-98-blg-35 which reached apeak magnification factor of almost 80. these observations by the microlensingplanet search (mps) and the moa collaborations place strong constraints on thepossible planetary system of the lens star and show intriguing evidence for alow mass planet with a mass fraction $4\times 10^{-5} \leq \epsilon \leq2\times 10^{-4}$. a giant planet with $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ is excluded from 95%of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 $r_e$ from the lens star, where $r_e$ is theeinstein ring radius of the lens. this exclusion region is more extensive thanthe generic "lensing zone" which is $0.6 - 1.6 r_e$. for smaller mass planets,we can exclude 57% of the "lensing zone" for $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ and 14% ofthe lensing zone for $\epsilon = 10^{-5}$. the mass fraction $\epsilon =10^{-5}$ corresponds to an earth mass planet for a lensing star of mass $\sim0.3 \msun$. a number of similar events will provide statistically significantconstraints on the prevalence of earth mass planets. in order to put our limitsin more familiar terms, we have compared our results to those expected for asolar system clone averaging over possible lens system distances andorientations. we find that such a system is ruled out at the 90% confidencelevel. a copy of the solar system with jupiter replaced by a second saturn massplanet can be ruled out at 70% confidence. our low mass planetary signal (fewearth masses to neptune mass) is significant at the $4.5\sigma$ confidencelevel. if this planetary interpretation is correct, the macho-98-blg-35 lenssystem constitutes the first detection of a low mass planet orbiting anordinary star without gas giant planets.
