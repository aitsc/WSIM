0903.2857	globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies - ii. nuclear star  clusters and their relation to massive galactic globular clusters	(abridged) using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters(gcs) in the nuclear regions (ngcs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from hst/acsimaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v_esc) of stellar ejectato reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of galactic gcswith extended (hot) horizontal branches (ehbs-gcs). for ehb-gcs, we find acorrelation between the present-day v_esc and their metallicity as well as(v-i)_0 colour. the similar v_esc, (v-i)_0 distribution of ngcs and ehb-gcsimplies that ngcs could also have complex stellar populations. the v_esc-[fe/h]relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocitywith metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusterstypically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than moremetal-rich clusters of the same mass do. thus the cluster v_esc can be used asparameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. the ngcs populate the samemv vs. rh region as ehb-gcs, although they do not reach the sizes of thelargest ehb-gcs like wcen and ngc 2419. we argue that during accretion the rhof an ngc could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinityand the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarfgalaxy dissolves. our results support the scenario in which galactic ehb-gcshave originated in the centres of pre-galactic building blocks or dwarfgalaxies that were later accreted by the milky way.

0903.4511	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. i. ngc 1846 and its wide main sequence turnoff	the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope has beenused to obtain deep, high-resolution images of the intermediate-age starcluster ngc 1846 in the large magellanic cloud. we present new color-magnitudediagrams (cmds) based on f435w, f555w, and f814w imaging. we test thepreviously observed broad main sequence turnoff region for "contamination" byfield stars and (evolved) binary star systems. we find that while these impactthe number of objects in this region, none can fully account for the largecolor spread. our results therefore solidify the recent finding that stars inthe main sequence turnoff region of this cluster have a large spread in colorwhich is unrelated to measurement errors or contamination by field stars, andlikely due to a ~300 myr range in the ages of cluster stars. an unbiasedestimate of the stellar density distribution across the main sequence turnoffregion shows that the spread is fairly continuous rather than strongly bimodalas suggested previously. we fit the cmds with several different sets oftheoretical isochrones, and determine systematic uncertainties for populationparameters when derived using any one set of isochrones. we note a degeneracybetween age and [alpha/fe], which can be lifted by matching the shape(curvature) of the full red giant branch in the cmd. we find that stars in theupper part of the main sequence turnoff region are more centrally concentratedthan those in any other region of the cmd, including more massive red giantbranch and asymptotic giant branch stars. we consider several possibleformation scenarios which account for the unusual features observed in the cmdof ngc 1846.

1002.2144	sao-6m telescope spectroscopic observations of globular clusters in  nearby galaxies	we present the results of medium-resolution spectroscopy of 28 globularclusters (gcs) in six nearby galaxies of different luminosities andmorphological types, situated in: m33 (15 objects), m31 (3), ic10 (4), ugca86(4), holmbergix (1), and ddo71 (1) obtained at the special astrophysicalobservatory 6-meter telescope. measurements of lick absorption-line indices andcomparison with ssp models enabled us to obtain their spectroscopic ages,metallicities and alpha-element to fe abundance ratios. we found that all oldand intermediate-age gcs in our sample have low metallicities [z/h] &lt; -0.8 dex.metal-rich clusters are young and are preferentially found in galaxies moremassive than ~10^9 m_sun. the least massive dwarfs of our sample, ddo71 andholmbergix, host one massive intermediate-age and one massive young metal-poorgc, respectively. [a/fe] abundance ratios tend to be enhanced but closer tosolar values for dwarf galaxies compared to gcs in more massive galaxies. weanalyse the age-metallicity relation for gcs in our galaxy sample and othersfrom the literature, and find, that 1) there is a general trend for gcs in lowsurface brightness dwarf galaxies to be more metal-poor at a given age than gcsin more massive galaxies; 2) the gc metallicity spread is wider for moremassive galaxies; 3) intermediate-age gcs in early-type dwarf galaxies are moremetal-rich at any given age than those in irregular galaxies of similarluminosity.

1004.2039	globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies: iii. formation  efficiencies of old globular clusters	we investigate the globular cluster (gc) system scaling parameters as afunction of galaxy mass, i.e. specific frequency (s_n), specific luminosity(s_l), specific mass (s_m), and specific number (^t) of gcs. we sample theentire range in galaxy luminosity (mv = -11 to -23 mag = 10^6 - 10^11 l_sol),environment, and morphology. irrespective of galaxy type, we confirm theincrease of the s_n-value above and below a galaxy magnitude of mv = -20 mag.over the full mass range, the s_l-value of early-type galaxies is, on average,twice that of late-types. to investigate the observed trends we derivetheoretical predictions of gc system scaling parameters as a function of hostgalaxy mass based on the models of dekel &amp; birnboim (2006) in whichstar-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback belowa stellar mass of 3x10^10 m_sol, and by virial shocks above it. we find thatthe analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the gc systemscaling parameter distributions with a universal specific gc formationefficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in gcs to the total galaxy halomass. early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses. this can be dueto the enhanced stochastic nature of the star and star-cluster formationprocesses for such systems. some massive galaxies have excess eta valuescompared to what is expected from the mean model prediction for galaxies moreluminous than mv = -20 mag (lv=10^10l_sol). this may be attributed to a veryefficient early gc formation, less efficient production of field stars oraccretion of predominantly low-mass/luminosity high-eta galaxies, or a mixtureof all these effects.

1005.3300	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. ii. data description and source  catalogs	the coma cluster was the target of a hst-acs treasury program designed fordeep imaging in the f475w and f814w passbands. although our survey wasinterrupted by the acs instrument failure in 2007, the partially completedsurvey still covers ~50% of the core high-density region in coma. observationswere performed for 25 fields that extend over a wide range of cluster-centricradii (~1.75 mpc) with a total coverage area of 274 arcmin^2. the majority ofthe fields are located near the core region of coma (19/25 pointings) with sixadditional fields in the south-west region of the cluster. in this paper wepresent reprocessed images and sextractor source catalogs for our surveyfields, including a detailed description of the methodology used for objectdetection and photometry, the subtraction of bright galaxies to measure faintunderlying objects, and the use of simulations to assess the photometricaccuracy and completeness of our catalogs. we also use simulations to performaperture corrections for the sextractor kron magnitudes based only on themeasured source flux and half-light radius. we have performed photometry for~73,000 unique objects; one-half of our detections are brighter than the10-sigma point-source detection limit at f814w=25.8 mag (ab). the slightmajority of objects (60%) are unresolved or only marginally resolved by acs. weestimate that coma members are 5-10% of all source detections, which consist ofa large population of unresolved objects (primarily gcs but also ucds) and awide variety of extended galaxies from a cd galaxy to dwarf lsb galaxies. thered sequence of coma member galaxies has a constant slope and dispersion across9 magnitudes (-21&lt;m_f814w&lt;-13). the initial data release for the hst-acs comatreasury program was made available to the public in 2008 august. the imagesand catalogs described in this study relate to our second data release.

1007.4962	the formation of spheroids in early-type spirals: clues from their  globular clusters	we use deep hubble space telescope images taken with the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) in the f475w and f814w filters to investigate the globularcluster systems in four edge-on sa spiral galaxies covering a factor of 4 inluminosity. the specific frequencies of the blue globular clusters in thegalaxies in our sample fall in the range 0.34 -- 0.84, similar to typicalvalues found for later-type spirals. the number of red globular clustersassociated with the bulges generally increases with the bulge luminosity,similar to what is observed for elliptical galaxies, although the specificfrequency of bulge clusters is a factor of 2-3 lower for the lowest luminositybulges than for the higher luminosity bulges. we present a new empiricalrelation between the fraction of red globular clusters and total bulgeluminosity based on the elliptical galaxies studied by acsvcs (acs virgocluster survey), and discuss how this diagram can be used to assess theimportance that dissipative processes played in building spiral bulges. ourresults suggest a picture where dissipative processes, which are expectedduring gas-rich major mergers, were more important for building luminous bulgesof sa galaxies, whereas secular evolution may have played a larger role inbuilding lower-luminosity bulges in spirals.

1009.3023	ultra-compact dwarfs in the core of the coma cluster	we have discovered both a red and a blue subpopulation of ultra-compact dwarf(ucd) galaxy candidates in the coma galaxy cluster. we analyzed deep f475w(sloan g) and f814w (i) hubble space telescope images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys wide field channel as part of the coma clustertreasury survey and have fitted the light profiles of ~5000 point-like sourcesin the vicinity of ngc 4874, one of the two central dominant galaxies of thecoma cluster. although almost all of these sources are globular clusters thatremain unresolved, we found that 52 objects have effective radii between ~10and 66 pc, in the range spanned by dwarf globular transition objects (dgto) anducds. of these 52 compact objects, 25 are brighter than m_v ~-11 mag, amagnitude conventionally thought to separate ucds and globular clusters. theucd/dgto candidates have the same color and luminosity distribution as the mostluminous globular clusters within the red and blue subpopulations of theimmensely rich ngc 4874 globular cluster system. unlike standard globularclusters, blue and red ucd/dgto subpopulations have the same median effectiveradius. the spatial distribution of ucd/dgto candidates reveal that theycongregate towards ngc 4874, and are not uniformly distributed. we find arelative deficit of ucd/dgtos compared with globular clusters in the inner 15kpc around ngc 4874, however at larger radii ucd/dgto and globular clustersfollow the same spatial distribution.

1102.2814	the star formation history of the large magellanic cloud star cluster  ngc1751	the hst/acs colour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) of the populous lmc star clusterngc1751 present both a broad main sequence turn-off and a dual clump of redgiants. we show that the latter feature is real and associate it to the firstappearance of electron-degeneracy in the h-exhausted cores of the clusterstars. we then apply to the ngc1751 data the classical method of star formationhistory (sfh) recovery via cmd reconstruction, for different radiicorresponding to the cluster centre, the cluster outskirts, and the underlyinglmc field. the mean sfh derived from the lmc field is taken into account duringthe stage of sfh-recovery in the cluster regions, in a novel approach which isshown to significantly improve the quality of the sfh results. for the clustercentre, we find a best-fitting solution corresponding to prolonged starformation for a for a timespan of 460 myr, instead of the two peaks separatedby 200 myr favoured by a previous work based on isochrone fitting. remarkably,our global best-fitting solution provides an excellent fit to the data - withchi^2 and residuals close to the theoretical minimum - reproducing all the cmdfeatures including the dual red clump. the results for a larger ring regionaround the centre indicate even longer star formation, but in this case theresults are of lower quality, probably because of the differential extinctiondetected in the area. therefore, the presence of age gradients in ngc1751 couldnot be probed. together with our previous findings for the smc cluster ngc419,the present results for the ngc1751 centre argue in favour of multiple starformation episodes (or continued star formation) being at the origin of themultiple main sequence turn-offs in magellanic cloud clusters with ages around1.5 gyr.

1105.1317	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. iii. dynamical evidence for a range of ages being  responsible for extended main sequence turnoffs	we present new analysis of 11 intermediate-age (1-2 gyr) star clusters in thelarge magellanic cloud based on hubble space telescope imaging data. seven ofthe clusters feature main sequence turnoff (msto) regions that are wider thancan be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giantbranches indicate a single value of [fe/h]. the star clusters cover a range inpresent-day mass from about 1e4 to 2e5 solar masses. we compare radialdistributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the msto region, andcalculate cluster masses and escape velocities from the present time back to acluster age of 10 myr. our main result is that for all clusters in our samplewith estimated escape velocities &gt; 15 km/s at an age of 10 myr, the stars inthe brightest half of the msto region are significantly more centrallyconcentrated than the stars in the faintest half and more massive red giantbranch and asymptotic giant branch stars. this is not the case for clusterswith escape velocities &lt; 10 km/s at an age of 10 myr. we argue that the widemsto region of such clusters is mainly caused by to a 200 - 500 myr range inthe ages of cluster stars due to extended star formation within the clusterfrom material shed by first-generation stars featuring slow stellar winds.dilution of this enriched material by accretion of ambient interstellar matteris deemed plausible if the spread of [fe/h] in this ambient gas was very smallwhen the second-generation stars were formed in the cluster.

1105.1337	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. ii. new insights from extended main sequence turnoffs in 7  star clusters	we discuss new photometry from high-resolution images of 7 intermediate-age(1-2 gyr) star clusters in the large magellanic cloud taken with the advancedcamera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope. we fit color-magnitudediagrams (cmds) with several different sets of theoretical isochrones, anddetermine systematic uncertainties for population parameters when derived usingany one set of isochrones. the cluster cmds show several interesting features,including extended main sequence turnoff (msto) regions, narrow red giantbranches, and clear sequences of unresolved binary stars. we show that theextended mstos are not caused by photometric uncertainties, contamination byfield stars, or the presence of binary stars. enhanced helium abundances in afraction of cluster stars are also ruled out as the reason for the extendedmstos. quantitative comparisons with simulations indicate that the msto regionsare better described by a spread in ages than by a bimodal age distribution,although we can not formally rule out the latter for the three lowest-massclusters in our sample (which have masses lower than about 3e4 solar masses).this conclusion differs from that of some previous works which suggested thatthe age distribution in massive clusters in our sample is bimodal. thissuggests that any secondary star formation occurred in an extended fashionrather than through short bursts. we discuss these results in the context ofthe nature of multiple stellar populations in star clusters.

1105.2561	probing the gc-lmxb connection in ngc 1399: a wide-field study with hst  and chandra	we present a wide field study of the globular clusters/low mass x-ray binary(lmxb) connection in the giant elliptical ngc1399. the large fov of theacs/wfc, combined with the hst and chandra high resolution, allow us toconstrain the lmxb formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. we confirm thatngc1399 has the highest lmxb fraction in gcs of all nearby elliptical galaxiesstudied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distancedue to the interplay of a differential gc vs galaxy light distribution and thegc color dependence. in fact lmxbs are preferentially hosted by bright, red gcsout to $&gt;5 r_{eff}$ of the galaxy light. the finding that gc hosting lmxbsfollow the radial distribution of their parent gc population, argues againstthe hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects lmxbformation in gcs. on the other hand field lmxbs closely match the host galaxylight, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not insidegcs. we measure gc structural parameters, finding that the lmxb formationlikelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity and gcs structuralparameters. in particular the gc central density plays a major role inpredicting which gc host accreting binaries. finally our analysis shows thatlmxbs in gcs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particularthe only color-confirmed gc with $l_x&gt;10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ shows novariability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple lmxbs in thesesystems.

1203.1242	sizes, half-mass densities, and mass functions of star clusters in the  merger remnant ngc 1316: clues to the fate of second-generation globular  clusters	we study mass functions of globular clusters derived from hst/acs images ofthe early-type merger remnant galaxy ngc 1316 which hosts a significantpopulation of metal-rich globular clusters of intermediate age (~3 gyr). forthe old, metal-poor (`blue') clusters, the peak mass of the mass function m_pincreases with internal half-mass density rho_h as (m_p proportional torho_h^0.44) whereas it stays approximately constant with galactocentricdistance r_gal. the mass functions of these clusters are consistent with asimple scenario in which they formed with a schechter initial mass function andevolved subsequently by internal two-body relaxation. for the intermediate-agepopulation of metal-rich ("red") clusters, the faint end of the previouslyreported power-law luminosity function of the clusters with r_gal &gt; 9 kpc isdue to many of those clusters having radii larger than the theoretical maximumvalue imposed by the tidal field of ngc 1316 at their r_gal. this rendersdisruption by two-body relaxation ineffective. only a few such diffuse clustersare found in the inner regions of ngc 1316. completeness tests indicate thatthis is a physical effect. using comparisons with star clusters in othergalaxies and cluster disruption calculations using published models, wehypothesize that most red clusters in the low-rho_h tail of the initialdistribution have already been destroyed in the inner regions of ngc 1316 bytidal shocking, and that several remaining low-rho_h clusters will evolvedynamically to become similar to "faint fuzzies" that exist in severallenticular galaxies. finally, we discuss the nature of diffuse red clusters inearly-type galaxies.

1209.3188	space-based uv/optical wide-field imaging and spectroscopy: near-field  cosmology and galaxy evolution using globular clusters in nearby galaxies	star formation plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies and of theuniverse as a whole. studies of star-forming regions in the local universe haveshown that star formation typically occurs in a clustered fashion. building acoherent picture of how star clusters form and evolve is therefore critical toour overall understanding of the star formation process. most clusters disruptafter they form, thus contributing to the field star population. however, themost massive and dense clusters remain bound and survive for a hubble time.these globular clusters provide unique observational probes of the formationhistory of their host galaxies. in particular, the age and metallicity can bedetermined for each globular cluster individually, allowing the distribution ofages and metallicities within host galaxies to be constrained. we show howspace-based uv-to-near-ir imaging covering a wide field of view (&gt;= 20 arcminper axis) and deep uv/optical multi-object spectroscopy of globular clustersystems in nearby galaxies would allow one to place important new constraintson the formation history of early-type galaxies and their structuralsubcomponents (e.g., bulge, halo).

1211.5131	the optical colors of giant elliptical galaxies and their metal-rich  globular clusters indicate a bottom-heavy initial mass function	we report a systematic and statistically significant offset between theoptical (g-z or b-i) colors of seven massive elliptical galaxies and the meancolors of their associated massive metal-rich globular clusters (gcs) in thesense that the parent galaxies are redder by 0.12-0.20 mag at a givengalactocentric distance. however, spectroscopic indices in the blue indicatethat the luminosity-weighted ages and metallicities of such galaxies are equalto that of their averaged massive metal-rich gcs at a given galactocentricdistance, to within small uncertainties. the observed color differences betweenthe red gc systems and their parent galaxies cannot be explained by thepresence of multiple stellar generations in massive metal-rich gcs, as theimpact of the latter to the populations' integrated g-z or b-i colors is foundto be negligible. however, we show that this paradox can be explained if thestellar initial mass function (imf) in these massive elliptical galaxies wassignificantly steeper at subsolar masses than canonical imfs derived from starcounts in the solar neighborhood, with the gc colors having become bluer due todynamical evolution, causing a significant flattening of the stellar mf of theaverage surviving gc.

1301.3381	the star formation history of the large magellanic cloud star clusters  ngc1846 and ngc1783	ngc1846 and ngc1783 are two massive star clusters in the large magellaniccloud, hosting both an extended main sequence turn-off and a dual clump of redgiants. they present similar masses but differ mainly in angular size. startingfrom their high-quality acs data in the f435w, f555w and f814w filters, andupdated sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, we derive their star formationrates as a function of age, sfr(t), by means of the classical method of cmdreconstruction which is usually applied to nearby galaxies. the method confirmsthe extended periods of star formation derived from previous analysis of thesame data. when the analysis is performed for a finer resolution in age, wefind clear evidence for a 50-myr long hiatus between the oldest peak in thesfr(t), and a second prolonged period of star formation, in both clusters. forthe more compact cluster ngc1846, there seems to be no significant differencebetween the sfr(t) in the cluster centre and in an annulus with radii between20 and 60 arcsec (from 4.8 to 15.4 pc). the same does not occur in the moreextended ngc1783 cluster, where the outer ring (between 33 and 107 arcsec, from8.0 to 25.9 pc) is found to be slightly younger than the centre. we alsoexplore the best-fitting slope of the present-day mass function and binaryfraction for the different cluster regions, finding hints of a varying massfunction between centre and outer ring in ngc1783. these findings are discussedwithin the present scenarios for the formation of clusters with multipleturn-offs.

1303.1361	an extended main sequence turn-off in the small magellanic cloud star  cluster ngc411	based on new observations with the wide field camera 3 onboard the hubblespace telescope, we report the discovery of an extended main sequence turn-off(emsto) in the intermediate-age star cluster ngc411. this is the second case ofan emsto being identified in a star cluster belonging to the small magellaniccloud (smc), after ngc419. despite the present masses of these two smc clustersdiffer by a factor of 4, the comparison between their colour--magnitudediagrams (cmd) shows striking similarities, especially regarding the shape oftheir emstos. the loci of main cmd features are so similar that they can bewell described, in a first approximation, by the same mean metallicity,distance and extinction. ngc411, however, presents merely a trace of secondaryred clump as opposed to its prominent manifestation in ngc419. this could bedue either to the small number statistics in ngc411, or by the star formationin ngc419 having continued for 60 myr longer than in ngc411. under theassumption that the emstos are caused by different generations of stars atincreasing age, both clusters are nearly coeval in their first episodes of starformation. the initial period of star formation, however, is slightly moremarked in ngc419 than in ngc411. we discuss these findings in the context ofpossible scenarios for the origin of emstos.

0801.3745	the hst/acs coma cluster survey: i - survey objectives and design	we describe the hst acs coma cluster treasury survey, a deep two-passbandimaging survey of one of the nearest rich clusters of galaxies, the comacluster (abell 1656).  the survey was designed to cover an area of 740 square arcmin in regions ofdifferent density of both galaxies and intergalactic medium within the cluster.the acs failure of january 27th 2007 leaves the survey 28% complete, with 21acs pointings (230 square arcmin) complete, and partial data for a further 4pointings (44 square arcmin).  predicted survey depth for 10 sigma detections for optimal photometry ofpoint sources is g' = 27.6 in the f475w filter, and ic=26.8 mag in f814 (abmagnitudes). initial simulations with artificially injected point sources show90% recovered at magnitude limits of g' = 27.55 and ic = 26.65. for extendedsources, the predicted 10 sigma limits for a 1 square arcsecond region are g' =25.8 mag/sq. arcsec and ic = 25.0 mag/sq. arcsec.  we highlight several motivating science goals of the survey, including studyof the faint end of the cluster galaxy luminosity function, structuralparameters of dwarf galaxies, stellar populations and their effect on colorsand color gradients, evolution of morphological components in a denseenvironment, the nature of ultra compact dwarf galaxies, and globular clusterpopulations of cluster galaxies of a range of luminosities and types. thissurvey will also provide a local rich cluster benchmark for various well knownglobal scaling relations and explore new relations pertaining to the nuclearproperties of galaxies.

1310.3755	the hst/acs coma cluster survey - vii. structure and assembly of massive  galaxies in the center of the coma cluster	we constrain the assembly history of galaxies in the projected central 0.5mpc of the coma cluster by performing structural decomposition on 69 massive(m_star &gt;= 10^9 m_sun) galaxies using high-resolution f814w images from the hsttreasury survey of coma. each galaxy is modeled with up to three sersiccomponents having a free sersic index n. after excluding the two cds in theprojected central 0.5 mpc of coma, 57% of the galactic stellar mass in theprojected central 0.5 mpc of coma resides in classical bulges/ellipticals while43% resides in cold disk-dominated structures. most of the stellar mass in comamay have been assembled through major (and possibly minor) mergers. hubbletypes are assigned based on the decompositions, and we find a strongmorphology-density relation; the ratio of (e+s0):spirals is (91.0%):9.0%. inagreement with earlier work, the size of outer disks in coma s0s/spirals issmaller compared with lower-density environments captured with sdss (datarelease 2). among similar-mass clusters from a hierarchical semi-analyticmodel, no single cluster can simultaneously match all the global properties ofthe coma cluster. the model strongly overpredicts the mass of cold gas andunderpredicts the mean fraction of stellar mass locked in hot components over awide range of galaxy masses. we suggest that these disagreements with the modelresult from missing cluster physics (e.g., ram-pressure stripping), and certainbulge assembly modes (e.g., mergers of clumps). overall, our study of comaunderscores that galaxy evolution is not solely a function of stellar mass, butalso of environment.

1310.5546	color-magnitude relations within globular cluster systems of giant  elliptical galaxies: the effects of globular cluster mass loss and the  stellar initial mass function	several recent studies have provided evidence for a `bottom-heavy' stellarinitial mass function (imf) in massive elliptical galaxies. here we investigatethe influence of the imf shape on the recently discovered color-magnituderelation (cmr) among globular clusters (gcs) in such galaxies. to this end weuse calculations of gc mass loss due to stellar and dynamical evolution toevaluate (i) the shapes of stellar mass functions in gcs after 12 gyr ofevolution as a function of current gc mass along with their effects onintegrated-light colors and mass-to-light ratios, and (ii) their impact on theeffects of gc self-enrichment using the 2009 `reference' model of bailin &amp;harris. as to the class of metal-poor gcs, we find the observed shape of thecmr (often referred to as the `blue tilt') to be very well reproduced by bailin&amp; harris' reference self-enrichment model once 12 gyr of gc mass loss is takeninto account. the influence of the imf on this result is found to beinsignificant. however, we find that the observed cmr among the class ofmetal-rich gcs (the `red tilt') can only be adequately reproduced if the imfwas bottom-heavy (e.g., $-3.0 &lt;~ \alpha &lt;~ -2.3$ in $dn/dm \proptom^{\alpha}$), which causes the stellar mass function at subsolar masses todepend relatively strongly on gc mass. this constitutes additional evidencethat the metal-rich stellar populations in giant elliptical galaxies wereformed with a bottom-heavy imf.

1401.2847	on the relation between metallicity and rgb color in hst/acs data	the determination of stellar metallicity and its gradient in externalgalaxies is a difficult task, but crucial for the understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. the color of the red giant branch (rgb) can be used todetermine metallicities of stellar populations that have only shallowphotometry. we will quantify the relation between metallicity and color in thewidely used hst acs filters f606w and f814w. we use a sample of globularclusters from the acs globular cluster survey and measure their rgb color atgiven absolute magnitudes to derive the color-metallicity relation. weespecially investigate the scatter and the uncertainties in this relation andshow its limitations. there is a clear relation between metallicity and rgbcolor. a comparison with isochrones shows reasonably good agreement with bastimodels, a small offset to dartmouth models, and a larger offset to paduamodels. even for the best globular cluster data available, the metallicity of asimple stellar population can be determined from the rgb alone only with anaccuracy of 0.3dex for [m/h]&lt; -1, and 0.15dex for [m/h]&gt; -1. for mixedpopulations, as they are observed in external galaxies, the uncertainties willbe even larger due to uncertainties in extinction, age, etc. therefore cautionis necessary when interpreting photometric metallicities.

1402.6714	wide-field hubble space telescope observations of the globular cluster  system in ngc1399	we present a comprehensive high spatial-resolution imaging study of globularclusters (gcs) in ngc1399, the central giant elliptical cd galaxy in the fornaxgalaxy cluster, conducted with hst/acs. using a novel technique to constructdrizzled psf libraries for hst/acs data, we accurately determine the fidelityof gc structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star clusterexperiments. the measurement of rh for the major fraction of the ngc1399 gcsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, rgal,out to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond. this trend is very similar forblue and red gcs which are found to have a mean size ratio ofrh(red)/rh(blue)=0.82+/-0.11 at all galactocentric radii from the core regionsof the galaxy out to ~40 kpc. this suggests that the size difference betweenblue and red gcs is due to internal mechanisms related to the evolution oftheir constituent stellar populations. modeling the mass density profile ofngc1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required tolimit the gc size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. we suggest that thismay be realized by an exotic gc orbit distribution function, an extended darkmatter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in thedwarf halo substructure at larger rgal. we match our gc rh measurements withradial velocity data from the literature and find that compact gcs show asignificantly smaller line-of-sight velocity dispersion, &lt;sigma(cmp)&gt;=225+/-25km/s, than their extended counterparts, &lt;sigma(ext)&gt;=317+/-21 km/s. consideringthe weaker statistical correlation in the gc rh-color and the gc rh-rgalrelations, the more significant gc size-dynamics relation appears to beastrophysically more relevant and hints at the dominant influence of the gcorbit distribution function on the evolution of gc structural parameters.

1405.0618	the luminosity function of low mass x-ray binaries in the globular  cluster system of ngc 1399	we present a study of the faint-end of the x-ray luminosity function of lowmass x-ray binaries in the globular cluster system of the cd galaxy ngc 1399 byperforming a stacking experiment on 618 x-ray undetected gcs, in order toverify the presence of faint lmxbs and to constrain the faint-end slope of thegc-lmxbs xlf below the individual detection threshold of $8\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ kev band. we obtain a significant x-ray detection forthe whole gc sample, as well as for the red and blue gc subpopulations,corresponding to an average luminosity per gc $&lt;l_{x}&gt;_{gc}$ of$(3.6\pm1.0)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, $(6.9\pm2.1)\times10^{36}\ erg\s^{-1}$ and $(1.7\pm0.9)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, respectively for all, redand blue gcs. if lmxbs in red and blue gcs have the same average intrinsicluminosity, we derive a red/blu ratio $\simeq 3$ of gcs hosting lmxbs($2.5\pm1.0$ or $4.1\pm2.5$ depending on the surveyed region); alternatively,assuming the fractions observed for brighter sources, we measure an averagex-ray luminosity of $l_{x}=(4.3\pm1.3)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ and$l_{x}=(3.4\pm1.7)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ per red and blue gc-lmxbsrespectively. in the assumption that the xlf follows a power-law distribution,we find that a low-luminosity break is required at $l_{x}\leq 8\times10^{37}$erg s$^{-1}$ both in the whole, as well as in the color-selected (red and blue)subsamples. given the bright-end slopes measured above the x-ray completenesslimit, this result is significant at $&gt;3\sigma$ level. our best estimates forthe faint end slope are $\beta_{l}=-1.39/-1.38/-1.36$ for all/red/bluegc-lmxbs. we also find evidence that the luminosity function becomes steeper atluminosities $l_x\gtrsim 3\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, as observed in oldellipticals.

1407.6957	new clues to the cause of extended main sequence turn-offs in  intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds	we use the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope(hst) to obtain deep, high resolution images of two intermediate-age starclusters in the large magellanic cloud of relatively low mass ($\approx$ $10^4$$m_{\odot}$) and significantly different core radii, namely ngc2209 andngc2249. for comparison purposes, we also re-analyzed archival hst images ofngc1795 and ic2146, two other relatively low mass star clusters. from thecomparison of the observed color-magnitude diagrams with monte carlosimulations, we find that the main sequence turnoff (msto) regions in ngc2209and ngc2249 are significantly wider than that derived from simulations ofsimple stellar populations, while those in ngc1795 and ic2146 are not. wedetermine the evolution of the clusters' masses and escape velocities from anage of 10 myr to the present age. we find that the differences among theseclusters can be explained by dynamical evolution arguments if the currentlyextended clusters (ngc2209 and ic2146) experienced stronger levels of initialmass segregation than the currently compact ones (ngc2249 and ngc1795). underthis assumption, we find that ngc2209 and ngc2249 have estimated escapevelocities $v_{\rm esc}$ $\geq$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ at an age of 10 myr, largeenough to retain material ejected by slow winds of first-generation stars,while the two clusters that do not feature extended mstos have $v_{\rm esc}$$\leq$ 12 km s$^{-1}$ at that age. these results suggest that the extended mstophenomenon can be better explained by a range of stellar ages rather than arange of stellar rotation velocities or interacting binaries.

1409.4766	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. x. nuclear star clusters in low-mass  early-type galaxies: scaling relations	we present scaling relations between structural properties of nuclear starclusters and their host galaxies for a sample of early-type dwarf galaxiesobserved as part of the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera forsurveys (acs) coma cluster survey. we have analysed the light profiles of 200early-type dwarf galaxies in the magnitude range $16.0 &lt; m_{f814w} &lt; 22.6 $mag, corresponding to $-19.0 &lt; m_{f814w} &lt; -12.4 $ mag.  nuclear star clusters are detected in 80% of the galaxies, thus doubling thesample of hst-observed early-type dwarf galaxies with nuclear star clusters.\changed{we confirm that the} nuclear star cluster detection fraction decreasesstrongly toward faint magnitudes. the luminosities of nuclear star clusters donot scale linearly with host galaxy luminosity. a linear fit yields l$_{nuc}\sim $l$_{gal}^{0.57\pm0.05}$. the nuclear star cluster-host galaxy luminosityscaling relation for low-mass early-type dwarf galaxies is consistent withformation by globular cluster accretion. we find that at similar luminosities,galaxies with higher s\'ersic indices have slightly more luminous nuclear starclusters. rounder galaxies have on average more luminous clusters.  some of the nuclear star clusters are resolved, despite the distance of coma.we argue that the relation between nuclear star cluster mass and size isconsistent with both formation by globular cluster accretion and in situformation.  our data are consistent with gc inspiraling being the dominant mechanism atlow masses, although the observed trend with s\'ersic index suggests that insitu star formation is an important second order effect.

1410.3840	extended main sequence turnoffs in intermediate-age star clusters: a  correlation between turnoff width and early escape velocity	we present color-magnitude diagram analysis of deep hubble space telescopeimaging of a mass-limited sample of 18 intermediate-age (1 - 2 gyr old) starclusters in the magellanic clouds, including 8 clusters for which new data wasobtained. we find that ${\it all}$ star clusters in our sample feature extendedmain sequence turnoff (emsto) regions that are wider than can be accounted forby a simple stellar population (including unresolved binary stars). fwhm widthsof the mstos indicate age spreads of 200-550 myr. we evaluate dynamicalevolution of clusters with and without initial mass segregation. our mainresults are: (1) the fraction of red clump (rc) stars in secondary rcs in emstoclusters scales with the fraction of msto stars having pseudo-ages $\leq 1.35$gyr; (2) the width of the pseudo-age distributions of emsto clusters iscorrelated with their central escape velocity $v_{\rm esc}$, both currently andat an age of 10 myr. we find that these two results are unlikely to bereproduced by the effects of interactive binary stars or a range of stellarrotation velocities. we therefore argue that the emsto phenomenon is mainlycaused by extended star formation within the clusters; (3) we find that $v_{\rmesc} \geq 15$ km/s out to ages of at least 100 myr for ${\it all}$ clustersfeaturing emstos, while $v_{\rm esc} \leq 12$ km/s at all ages for twolower-mass clusters in the same age range that do ${\it not}$ show emstos. weargue that emstos only occur for clusters whose early escape velocities arehigher than the wind velocities of stars that provide material from whichsecond-generation stars can form. the threshold of 12-15 km/s is consistentwith wind velocities of intermediate-mass agb stars in the literature.

1503.07862	on the interpretation of sub-giant branch morphologies of  intermediate-age star clusters with extended main sequence turnoffs	recent high-quality photometry of many star clusters in the magellanic cloudswith ages of 1$\,-\,$2 gyr revealed main sequence turnoffs (mstos) that aresignificantly wider than can be accounted for by a simple stellar population(ssp). such extended mstos (emstos) are often interpreted in terms of an agespread of several $10^8$ yr, challenging the traditional view of star clustersas being formed in a single star formation episode. li et al. and bastian &amp;niederhofer recently investigated the sub-giant branches (sgbs) of ngc 1651,ngc 1806, and ngc 1846, three star clusters in the large magellanic cloud (lmc)that exhibit an emsto. they argued that the sgb of these star clusters can beexplained only by a ssp. we study these and two other similar star clusters inthe lmc, using extensive simulations of ssps including unresolved binaries. wefind that the shapes of the cross-sgb profiles of all star clusters in oursample are in fact consistent with their cross-msto profiles when the latterare interpreted as age distributions. conversely, sgb morphologies of starclusters with emstos are found to be inconsistent with those of simulated ssps.finally, we create parsec isochrones from tracks featuring a grid of convectiveovershoot levels and a very fine grid of stellar masses. a comparison of theobserved photometry with these isochrones shows that the morphology of the redclump (rc) of such star clusters is also consistent with that implied by theirmsto in the age spread scenario. we conclude that the sgb and rc morphologiesof star clusters featuring emstos are consistent with the scenario in which theemstos are caused by a distribution of stellar ages.

1504.03299	new constraints on the star formation history of the star cluster ngc  1856	we use the wide field camera 3 onboard the hubble space telescope to obtaindeep, high-resolution photometry of the young (age ~ 300 myr) star clusterngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud. we compare the observed colour-magnitudediagram (cmd), after having applied a correction for differential reddening,with monte carlo simulations of simple stellar populations (ssps) of variousages. we find that the main sequence turn-off (msto) region is wider than thatderived from the simulation of a single ssp. using constraints based on thedistribution of stars in the msto region and the red clump, we find that thecmd is best reproduced using a combination of two different ssps with agesseparated by 80 myr (0.30 and 0.38 gyr, respectively). however, we can notformally exclude that the width of the msto could be due to a range of stellarrotation velocities if the efficiency of rotational mixing is higher thantypically assumed. using a king-model fit to the surface number density profilein conjunction with dynamical evolution models, we determine the evolution ofcluster mass and escape velocity from an age of 10 myr to the present age,taking into account the possible effects of primordial mass segregation. wefind that the cluster has an escape velocity vesc ~ 17 km/s at an age of 10myr, and it remains high enough during a period of ~ 100 myr to retain materialejected by slow winds of first-generation stars. our results are consistentwith the presence of an age spread in ngc1856, in contradiction to the resultsof bastian &amp; silva-villa (2013).

1511.05166	compact stellar systems in the polar ring galaxies ngc 4650a and ngc  3808b: clues to polar disk formation	polar ring galaxies (prgs) are composed of two kinematically distinct andnearly orthogonal components, a host galaxy (hg) and a polar ring/disk (pr).the hg usually contains an older stellar population than the pr. the suggestedformation channel of prgs is still poorly constrained. suggested options aremerger, gas accretion, tidal interaction, or a combination of both. toconstrain the formation scenario of prgs, we study the compact stellar systems(csss) in two prgs at different evolutionary stages: ngc 4650a withwell-defined pr, and ngc 3808b, which is in the process of pr formation. we usearchival hst/wfpc2 imaging. psf-fitting techniques, and color selectioncriteria are used to select cluster candidates. photometric analysis of thecsss was performed to determine their ages and masses using stellar populationmodels at a fixed metallicity. both prgs contain young csss ($&lt; 1$ gyr) withmasses of up to 5$\times$10$^6$m$_\odot$, mostly located in the pr and alongthe tidal debris. the most massive csss may be progenitors of metal-richglobular clusters or ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies. we identify one suchyoung ucd candidate, ngc 3808 b-8, and measure its size of $r_{\rmeff}=25.23^{+1.43}_{-2.01}$ pc. we reconstruct the star formation history ofthe two prgs and find strong peaks in the star formation rate (sfr $\simeq$200m$_\odot$/yr) in ngc 3808b, while ngc 4650a shows milder (declining) starformation (sfr $&lt;$ 10m$_\odot$/yr). this difference may support differentevolutionary paths between these prgs. the spatial distribution, masses, andpeak star formation epoch of the clusters in ngc 3808 suggest for a tidallytriggered star formation. incompleteness at old ages prevents us from probingthe sfr at earlier epochs of ngc 4650a, where we observe the fading tail of cssformation. this also impedes us from testing the formation scenarios of thisprg.

astro-ph;0107533	the star cluster system of the 3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316: clues  from optical and near-infrared photometry	the giant merger remnant galaxy ngc 1316 (fornax a) is an ideal probe forstudying the long-term effects of a past major merger on star cluster systems,given its spectroscopically derived merger age of ~3 gyr which we reported in arecent paper. here we present new ground-based, large-area optical and near-irimaging of star clusters in ngc 1316, complemented with deep hst/wfpc2 imaging.we find that the optical-near-ir colours and luminosities of the brightest ~10clusters in ngc 1316 are consistent with those of intermediate-age (2-3 gyr)populations. unlike `normal' giant ellipticals, the b-i colour distribution ofclusters in ngc 1316 is not clearly bimodal. however, the luminosity functions(lfs) of the blue and red parts of the cluster colour distribution aredifferent: the red cluster lf is well represented by a power law with index-1.2 +/- 0.3, extending to about 1.5 mag brighter (in b) than those of typicalgiant ellipticals. in contrast, the shape of the blue cluster lf is consistentwith that of `normal' spiral and elliptical galaxies. we conclude that the starcluster system of ngc 1316 is a combination of a population of age ~3 gyrhaving roughly solar metallicity and a population of old, metal-poor clusterswhich probably belonged to the pre-merger galaxies. after the 3 gyr old,metal-rich clusters fade to an age of 10 gyr, they will form a red `peak' in abimodal cluster colour distribution. this `red peak' will have a colourconsistent with that found in `normal, old' giant ellipticals of the samegalaxy luminosity (taking age dimming into account). these features of the starcluster system of ngc 1316 are fully consistent with scenarios for forming`normal' giant elliptical galaxies through gas-rich mergers at look-back times$\ga$ 10 gyr.

astro-ph;0304195	hubble space telescope observations of globular cluster systems along  the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies	we have studied the globular cluster (gc) systems of 7 giant, edge-on spiralgalaxies using hubble space telescope imaging in v and i. the galaxy samplecovers the hubble types sa to sc, allowing us to study the variation of theproperties of gc systems along the hubble sequence. the photometry reaches ~1.5mag beyond the turn-over magnitude of the gc luminosity function for eachgalaxy. specific frequencies (s_n values) of gcs were evaluated by comparingthe numbers of gcs found in our wfpc2 pointings with those in the milky waywhich would be detected in the same metric area. the s_n values of spirals withb/t &lt;= 0.3 (i.e., spirals with a hubble type later than about sb) areconsistent with a value of s_n = 0.55 +- 0.25. we suggest that this populationof gcs represents a `universal', old halo population that is present aroundeach galaxy. most galaxies in our sample have s_n values that are consistentwith a scenario in which gc systems are made up of (i) the aforementioned halopopulation plus (ii) a population that is associated with bulges, which growslinearly with the mass of the bulge. such scenarios include the `mergerscenario' for the formation of elliptical galaxies as well as the `multi-phasecollapse' scenario, but it seems inconsistent with the `secular evolution'scenario of pfenniger &amp; norman (1990), in which bulges are formed from discstars by means of the redistribution of angular momentum through barinstabilities and/or minor perturbations. however, there is one bulge-dominatedspiral galaxy in our sample (ngc 7814) with a low s_n value that is consistentwith those of the latest-type spirals. thus, our results suggest that theformation histories of galaxy bulges of early-type spirals can be significantlydifferent from one galaxy to another.

astro-ph;0308146	a two-arm gaseous spiral in the inner 200 pc of the early-type galaxy  ngc 2974: signature of an inner bar	tiger integral-field spectrography and hst/wfpc2 imaging of the e3 galaxy ngc2974 are used to derive the kinematics of the stellar and ionized gascomponents in its central 500 pc. we derive a numerical two-integraldistribution function from a mge mass model using the hq formalism. the tigeras well as published long-slit stellar kinematics are well fitted with thisself-consistent model, requiring neither the addition of a significant masscontribution from a hidden disc structure, nor the presence of a central darkmass. the data reveal the presence of a striking, highly contrasted, two-armgaseous spiral structure within a radius of ~200 pc, corresponding to a totalmass of 6.8x10^4 msun of ionized gas. we use a deconvolved tiger datacube toprobe its kinematics at a resolution of about 0.35 arcsec. strong departuresfrom circular motions are observed, as well as high velocity dispersion valueson the inner side of the arms. we interpret the observed gas morphology andkinematics as the signature of streaming gas flows driven by a ~540 pc diameterbar with ome=700+/-100 km/s/kpc. this hypothesis is strongly supported by thepredictions of a density wave model. this model predicts that the bar shouldlie at about 35 degree from the line of nodes, and implies gas inflow towardsthe central ~50 pc. the quadrupole pertubation due to this bar is estimated torepresent less than 2% of the underlying gravitational potential. despite itsweakness, the inner bar of ngc 2974 may be able to drive some gas within a 10pc radius. we suggest that the presence of such inner bars might be more commonamong early-type disk galaxies than is generally thought, and that deephigh-resolution emission-line imagery may be the best way to detect suchstructures.

0705.4092	evidence for the evolution of young early-type galaxies in the  goods/cdf-s field	we have developed an efficient photometric technique for identifying youngearly-type galaxy candidates using a combination of photometric redshifts,spectral-type classification, and optical/near-infrared colors. applying ourtechnique to the goods hst/acs and vlt/isaac data we have selected a completeand homogeneous sample of young elliptical candidates among early-type fieldgalaxies. the distribution of structural parameters for these candidates showsthat their selection, which is based on early spectral types, is fullyconsistent with early morphological types. we investigate the evolution oftheir luminosities and colors as a function of redshift and galaxy mass andfind evidence for an increasing starburst mass fraction in these youngearly-type galaxy candidates at higher redshifts, which we interpret in termsof massive field galaxies experiencing more massive/intense starbursts athigher redshifts. moreover, we find indications for a systematically largeryoung elliptical fraction among sub-l*/2 early-type galaxies compared to theirbrighter counterparts. the total fraction among the field early-type galaxiesincreases with redshift, irrespective of galaxy luminosity. our results aremost consistent with galaxy formation scenarios in which stars in massiveearly-type field galaxies are assembled earlier than in their low-masscounterparts.

astro-ph;0408085	deep luminosity functions of old and intermediate-age globular clusters  in ngc 1316: evidence for dynamical evolution of second-generation globular  clusters	the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope has beenused to obtain deep high-resolution images of the giant early-type galaxy ngc1316 which is an obvious merger remnant. these observations supersede previous,shallower observations which revealed the presence of a population ofmetal-rich globular clusters of intermediate age (~ 3 gyr). we detect a totalof 1496 cluster candidates, almost 4 times as many as from the previous wfpc2images. we confirm the bimodality of the color distribution of clusters, evenin v-i, with peak colors 0.93 and 1.06. the large number of detected clustersallows us to evaluate the globular cluster luminosity functions as a functionof galactocentric radius. we find that the luminosity function of the inner 50%of the intermediate-age, metal-rich (`red') population of clusters differsmarkedly from that of the outer 50%. in particular, the luminosity function ofthe inner 50% of the red clusters shows a clear flattening consistent with aturnover that is about 1.0 mag fainter than the turnover of the blue clusters.this constitutes the first direct evidence that metal-rich cluster populationsformed during major mergers of gas-rich galaxies can evolve dynamically(through disruption processes) into the red, metal-rich cluster populationsthat are ubiquitous in `normal' giant ellipticals.

astro-ph;0408424	the photometric properties of isolated early-type galaxies	isolated galaxies are important since they probe the lowest density regimesinhabited by galaxies. we define a sample of 36 nearby isolated early-typegalaxies for further study. our isolation criteria require them to have nocomparable-mass neighbours within 2 b-band magnitudes, 0.67 mpc in the plane ofthe sky and 700 km/s in recession velocity. new wide-field optical imaging of10 isolated galaxies with the anglo-australian telescope confirms theirearly-type morphology and relative isolation. we also present imaging of 4galaxy groups as a control sample. the isolated galaxies are shown to be moregravitationally isolated than the group galaxies. we find that the isolatedearly-type galaxies have a mean effective colour of (b-r)_e = 1.54 +/- 0.14,similar to their high-density counterparts. they reveal a similarcolour-magnitude relation slope and small intrinsic scatter to clusterellipticals. they also follow the kormendy relation of surface brightnessversus size for luminous cluster galaxies. such properties suggest that theisolated galaxies formed at a similar epoch to cluster galaxies, such that thebulk of their stars are very old. however, our galaxy modelling revealsevidence for dust lanes, plumes, shells, boxy and disk isophotes in four out ofnine galaxies. thus at least some isolated galaxies have experienced a recentmerger/accretion event which may have induced a small burst of star formation.we derive luminosity functions for the isolated galaxies and find a faint slopeof -1.2, which is similar to the `universal' slope found in a wide variety ofenvironments. we examine the number density distribution of galaxies in thefield of the isolated galaxies.

astro-ph;0408554	the group evolution multiwavelength study (gems): bimodal luminosity  functions in galaxy groups	we present b and r-band luminosity functions (lf) for a sample of 25 nearbygroups of galaxies. we find that the lfs of the groups with low x-rayluminosity (l_x &lt; 10^{41.7} erg/s) are significantly different from those ofthe x-ray brighter groups, showing a prominent dip around m_b = -18. while bothcategories show lack of late-type galaxies in their central regions, x-ray dimgroups also show a more marked concentration of optical luminosity towards thecentre. a toy simulation shows that in the low velocity dispersion environment,as in the x-ray dim group, dynamical friction would facilitate more rapidmerging, thus depleting intermediate-luminosity galaxies to form a few giantcentral galaxies, resulting in the prominent dip seen in our lfs. we suggestthat x-ray dim (or low velocity dispersion) groups are the present sites ofrapid dynamical evolution rather than their x-ray bright counterparts, and maybe the modern precursors of fossil groups. we predict that these groups of lowvelocity dispersion would harbour younger stellar populations than groups orclusters with higher velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0505453	vlt spectroscopy of globular cluster systems, ii. spectroscopic ages,  metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios of globular clusters in early-type  galaxies	an analysis of ages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios of globular clustersystems in early-type galaxies is presented, based on lick index measurementssummarized in puzia et al. (2004, paper i of this series). in the light ofcalibration and measurement uncertainties, age-metallicity degeneracy, and therelative dynamic range of lick indices, as well as systematics introduced byabundance ratio variations (in particular variations of [alpha/fe] ratios), wefind that the most reliable age indicator for our dataset is a combination ofthe lick balmer-line indices hgammaa, hbeta, and hdeltaa. [mgfe]' is used as aspectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/fe]variations. we introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously deriveages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructedfrom lick indices. from a comparison of high-quality data with ssp modelpredictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxiesare older than 10 gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 gyr, and only afew cluster are younger than ~5 gyr. our sample of globular clusters coversmetallicities from [z/h] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. we find that metal-richglobular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatterthan their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/fe] diagnostic plots show thatglobular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/feabundance ratios with a mean [alpha/fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion ofabout 0.3 dex. we find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/fe] andmetallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit loweralpha-element enhancements.

astro-ph;0602263	the old globular cluster system of the dirr galaxy ngc1427a in the  fornax cluster	we present a study of the old globular cluster (gc) population of the dwarfirregular galaxy ngc 1427a using multi-wavelength vlt observations in u, b, v,i, h_alpha, j, h, and ks bands under excellent observing conditions. we appliedcolor and size selection criteria to select old gc candidates and made use ofarchival acs images taken with the hubble space telescope to rejectcontaminating background sources and blended objects from the gc candidates'list. the h_alpha observations were used to check for contamination due tocompact, highly reddened young star clusters whose colors and sizes could mimicthose of old gcs. after accounting for contamination we obtain a total numberof 38+/-8 gc candidates with colors consistent with an old (~10 gyr) andmetal-poor (z &lt; 0.4xz_solar) population as judged by simple stellar populationmodels. our contamination analysis indicates that the density distribution ofgcs in the outskirts of the fornax central cd galaxy ngc1399 may not bespherically symmetric. we derive a present-day specific frequency s_n of1.6+/-0.23 for ngc 1427a, a value significantly larger than what is observed inthe local group dwarf irregular galaxies and comparable with the values foundfor the same galaxy types in the virgo and fornax clusters. assuming auniversal globular cluster luminosity function turnover magnitude, we derive adistance modulus to ngc 1427a of 31.01+/-0.21 mag which places it3.2+/-2.5(statistic)+/-1.6(systematic) mpc in front of the fornax central cdgalaxy ngc 1399. the implications of this result for the relationship betweenngc 1427a and the cluster environment are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0605210	extremely alpha-enriched globular clusters in early-type galaxies: a  step towards the dawn of stellar populations?	we compare [alpha/fe], metallicity, and age distributions of globularclusters in elliptical, lenticular, and spiral galaxies, which we derive fromlick line index measurements. we find a large number of globular clusters inelliptical galaxies that reach significantly higher [alpha/fe] values (&gt;0.5)than any clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies. most of these extremelyalpha-enriched globular clusters are old (t &gt; 8 gyr) and cover the metallicityrange -1 &lt;~ [z/h] &lt;~ 0. a comparison with supernova yield models suggests thatthe progenitor gas clouds of these globular clusters must have beenpredominantly enriched by massive stars (&gt;~20 m_sol) with little contributionfrom lower-mass stars. the measured [alpha/fe] ratios are also consistent withyields of very massive pair-instability supernovae (~130-190 m_sol). bothscenarios imply that the chemical enrichment of the progenitor gas wascompleted on extremely short timescales of the order of a few myr. given thelower [alpha/fe] average ratios of the diffuse stellar population in early-typegalaxies, our results suggest that these extremely alpha-enhanced globularclusters could be members of the very first generation of star clusters formed,and that their formation epochs would predate the formation of the majority ofstars in giant early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0607617	a database of 2mass near-infrared colors of magellanic cloud star  clusters	the (rest-frame) near-ir domain contains important stellar populationdiagnostics and is often used to estimate masses of galaxies at low as well ashigh redshifts. however, many stellar population models are still relativelypoorly calibrated in this part of the spectrum. to allow an improvement of thiscalibration we present a new database of integrated near-infrared jhksmagnitudes for 75 star clusters in the magellanic clouds, using the 2-micronall-sky survey (2mass). the majority of the clusters in our sample have robustage and metallicity estimates from color-magnitude diagrams available in theliterature, and populate a range of ages from 10 myr to 15 gyr and a range in[fe/h] from -2.17 to +0.01 dex. a comparison with matched star clusters in the2mass extended source catalog (xsc) reveals that the xsc only provides a goodfit to the unresolved component of the cluster stellar population. we alsocompare our results with the often-cited single-channel jhk photometry ofpersson and collaborators, and find significant differences, especially fortheir 30"-diameter apertures up to ~2.5 mag in the k-band, more than 1 mag inj-k, and up to 0.5 mag in h-k. using simulations to center apertures based onmaximum light throughput (as performed by persson et al, we show that thesedifferences can be attributed to near-ir-bright cluster stars (e.g., carbonstars) located away from the true center of the star clusters. the wide age andmetallicity coverage of our integrated jhks photometry sample constitutes afundamental dataset for testing population synthesis model predictions, and fordirect comparison with near-ir observations of distant stellar populations.

astro-ph;0608349	empirical corrections for charge transfer inefficiency and associated  centroid shifts for stis ccd observations	a variety of on-orbit imaging and spectroscopic observations are used tocharacterize the charge transfer efficiency (cte) of the charge-coupled device(ccd) of the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) aboard the hubblespace telescope. a set of formulae is presented to correct observations ofpoint sources for cte-related loss of signal. for data taken in imaging mode,the cte loss is parametrized in terms of the location of the source on the ccd,the source signal level within the measurement aperture, the background level,and the time of observation. for spectroscopic data, it is found that oneadditional parameter is needed to provide an adequate calibration of the cteloss, namely the signal in the point spread function located between the signalextraction box and the read-out amplifier. the effect of the latter parameteris significant for spectra taken using the g750l or g750m gratings of stis. thealgorithms presented here correct flux calibration inaccuracies due to ctelosses as large as 30% to within ~ 1.5% rms throughout the wavelength rangecovered by the stis ccd modes. this uncertainty is similar to the poisson noiseassociated with a source detected at a signal level of about 2500 electrons perresolution element. using bi-directional ccd readouts, centroid shifts incurreddue to cte loss are also derived. a tight correlation is found between the cteloss and the centroid shift (both for imaging and spectroscopic modes), thusenabling one to correct for both effects of imperfect charge transfer to stisccd observations.

astro-ph;9504011	interstellar matter in shapley-ames elliptical galaxies. iv. a diffusely  distributed component of dust and its effect on colour gradients	the presence of dust in elliptical galaxies has recently been shown to bequite common. deep optical multi-colour ccd imaging has revealed the presenceof dust lanes and patches, and the technique of co-adding iras survey scans hasled to many detections of elliptical galaxies. the optical and far-infraredsurveys reported similar detection rates of dust, which may indicate that dustin elliptical galaxies is generally distributed in the optically detected lanesor patches. however, we show here that the amount of dust as derived from theoptical extinction values is typically an order of magnitude smaller than thatderived from the iras flux densities, in strong contrast with the situation inspiral galaxies.  to unriddle this dilemma, we postulate that the majority of the dust inelliptical galaxies exists as a diffusely distributed component which isundetectable using optical methods. employing a multiple scattering model forthe dust, we show that the presence of this newly postulated dust componentimplies significant radial colour gradients which were essentially thought toarise from stellar population gradients only.  the energetics of the diffusely distributed dust component is shown to beconsistent with the iras data. a comparison of the detectable amount of dust inelliptical galaxies embedded in hot, x-ray-emitting gas with the amountexpected in case the production and destruction rates of dust are equalindicates that most of the dust in elliptical galaxies has been accreted fromother galaxies.

astro-ph;9809057	the nature of ionized gas in giant elliptical galaxies	i review the current understanding of the origin and nature of ``warm''ionized gas in giant elliptical galaxies in the light of results of recentimaging and spectroscopic surveys. ccd imaging surveys have revealed thatemission-line disks or filaments are (as a rule) associated with dustabsorption, even in the x-ray brightest systems. this strongly suggests thatthe origin of this ionized gas is generally not through ``cooling flows'';galaxy interactions are favored instead.  using data from a new spectrophotometric survey of ``normal'' ellipticalgalaxies covering the whole optical range, the extended ionized gas in giantellipticals is found to be --without exception-- of the liner class, and mostprobably not powered by star formation activity. i discuss two independentpieces of evidence which suggest that the extended gas in giant ellipticals isionized by means of a distributed source of ionization: (i) a significantcorrelation exists between the h-alpha+[nii]luminosity and the opticalluminosity within the region occupied by the ionized gas, and (ii) theionization parameter of the gas does not change significantly withgalactocentric radius. two potential sources of ionization are evaluated:photoionization by old hot stars (of post-agb and/or agb-manque' type) andmechanical energy flux from electron conduction in hot, x-ray-emitting gas.

astro-ph;9911412	properties of dust in giant elliptical galaxies: the role of the  environment	the properties of dust in giant elliptical galaxies are reviewed, withparticular emphasis on the influence of the environment.  after normalizing by the optical luminosities, a strong anti-correlationbetween the masses of dust and hot gas in x-ray bright ellipticals is found.furthermore, large-scale, regularly-shaped dust lanes (which are symmetric withrespect to the galaxy nucleus) are only found to be present in ellipticals withthe lowest ratios of the mass of hot gas to the blue luminosity m_hot/l_b &lt;0.04 in solar units. this can be explained by the short time scale for thedestruction of dust grains within hot gas compared to the formation timescaleof such dust lanes in early-type galaxies.  dust within ellipticals in ``loose'' environments (in the field or in loosegroups) is typically characterized by small values of r_v = a_v/e(b-v) (i.e.,small characteristic grain sizes), and distributed in dust lanes with a smooth,relaxed morphology. on the other hand, dust in ellipticals that are in or nearthe center of dense groups or clusters is typically much more irregularlydistributed, and characterized by r_v values that are close to the galacticone.  i predict that ellipticals containing ``relaxed'' dust lanes with typicaldust masses of 10e6 - 10e7 solar masses do not contain hot, x-ray-emitting gas.
