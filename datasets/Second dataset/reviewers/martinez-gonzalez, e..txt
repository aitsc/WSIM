0902.1523	improved constraints on primordial non-gaussianity for the wilkinson  microwave anisotropy probe 5-yr data	we present new constraints on the non-linear coupling parameter fnl with thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data. we use an updated methodbased on the spherical mexican hat wavelet (smhw) which provides improvedconstraints on the fnl parameter. this paper is a continuation of a previouswork by curto et al. where several third order statistics based on the smhwwere considered. in this paper, we use all the possible third order statisticscomputed from the wavelet coefficient maps evaluated at 12 angular scales. thescales are logarithmically distributed from 6.9 arcmin to 500 arcmin. ouranalysis indicates that fnl is constrained to -18 &lt; fnl &lt; +80 at 95% confidencelevel (cl) for the combined v+w wmap map. this value has been corrected by thepresence of undetected point sources, which adds a positive contribution ofdelta_fnl = 6 +- 5. our result excludes at ~99% cl the best-fitting valuefnl=87 reported by yadav &amp; wandelt. we have also constrained fnl for the q, vand w frequency bands separately, finding compatibility with zero at 95 % clfor the q and v bands but not for the w band. we have performed some furthertests to understand the cause of this deviation which indicate that systematicsassociated to the w radiometers could be responsible for this result. finallywe have performed a galactic north-south analysis for fnl. we have not foundany asymmetry, i.e. the best-fitting fnl for the northern pixels is compatiblewith the best-fitting fnl for the southern pixels.

0706.2346	non-gaussianity analysis on local morphological measures of wmap data	the decomposition of a signal on the sphere with the steerable waveletconstructed from the second gaussian derivative gives access to theorientation, signed-intensity, and elongation of the signal's local features.in the present work, the non-gaussianity of the wmap temperature data of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) is analyzed in terms of the first fourmoments of the statistically isotropic random fields associated with theselocal morphological measures, at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizesbetween 27.5 arcminutes and 30 degrees on the celestial sphere. while nodetection is made neither in the orientation analysis nor in the elongationanalysis, a strong detection is made in the excess kurtosis of thesigned-intensity of the wmap data. the non-gaussianity is observed with asignificance level below 0.5% at a wavelet scale corresponding to an angularsize around 10 degrees, and confirmed at neighbour scales. this supports aprevious detection of an excess of kurtosis in the wavelet coefficient of thewmap data with the axisymmetric mexican hat wavelet (vielva et al. 2004).instrumental noise and foreground emissions are not likely to be at the originof the excess of kurtosis. large-scale modulations of the cmb related to someunknown systematics are rejected as possible origins of the detection. theobserved non-gaussianity may therefore probably be imputed to the cmb itself,thereby questioning the basic inflationary scenario upon which the presentconcordance cosmological model relies. taking the cmb temperature angular powerspectrum of the concordance cosmological model at face value, further analysisalso suggests that this non-gaussianity is not confined to the directions onthe celestial sphere with an anomalous signed-intensity.

0706.4289	a low cmb variance in the wmap data	we have estimated the cmb variance from the three-year wmap data, finding avalue which is significantly lower than the one expected from gaussiansimulations using the wmap best-fit cosmological model, at a significance levelof 98.7 per cent. this result is even more prominent if we consider only thenorth ecliptic hemisphere (99.8 per cent). different analyses have beenperformed in order to identify a possible origin for this anomaly. inparticular we have studied the behaviour of single radiometers and single yeardata as well as the effect of residual foregrounds and 1/f noise, finding thatnone of these possibilities can explain the low value of the variance. we havealso tested the effect of varying the cosmological parameters, finding that theestimated cmb variance tends to favour higher values of $n_s$ than the one ofthe wmap best-fit model. in addition, we have also tested the consistencybetween the estimated cmb variance and the actual measured cmb power spectrumof the wmap data, finding a strong discrepancy. a possible interpretation ofthis result could be a deviation from gaussianity and/or isotropy of the cmb.

1002.4029	cmb polarization as a probe of the anomalous nature of the cold spot	one of the most interesting explanations for the non-gaussian cold spot (cs)detected in the wmap data by vielva et al. 2004, is that it arises from theinteraction of the cmb radiation with a cosmic texture (cruz et al. 2007b). inthis case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, ascompared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a girf. inaddition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of thegravitational field could lead to a similar scenario. however, some of thesealternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) havebeen shown to be very unlikely. in this work we characterise the polarizationproperties of the cold spot under both hypotheses: a large gaussian spot and ananomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture. we propose amethodology to distinguish between them, and we discuss its discriminationpower as a function of the instrumental noise level. in particular, we addressthe cases of current experiments, like wmap and planck, and others indevelopment as quijote. we find that for an ideal experiment the gaussianhypothesis could be rejected at a significance level better than 0.8%. whilewmap is far from providing useful information in this respect, we find thatplanck will be able to reach a significance of around 7%; in addition, we showthat the ground-based experiment quijote could provide a significance of around1%. if these results are combined with the significance level found for the csin temperature, the capability of quijote and planck to reject the alternativehypothesis becomes 0.025% and 0.124%, respectively.

1007.2181	on the optimality of the spherical mexican hat wavelet estimator for the  primordial non-gaussianity	we study the spherical mexican hat wavelet (smhw) as a detector of primordialnon-gaussianity of the local type on the cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropies. for this purpose we define third order statistics based on thewavelet coefficient maps and the original map. we find the dependence of thesestatistics in terms of the non-linear coupling parameter fnl and the bispectrumof this type of non-gaussianity. we compare the analytical values for thesestatistics with the results obtained with non-gaussian simulations for an idealfull-sky cmb experiment without noise. we study the power of this method todetect fnl, i. e. the variance of this parameter, and compare it with thevariance obtained from the primary bispectrum for the same experiment. finallywe apply our wavelet based estimator on wmap-like maps with incomplete sky andinhomogeneous noise and compare with the optimal bispectrum estimator. theresults show that the wavelet cubic statistics are as efficient as thebispectrum as optimal detectors of this type of primordial non-gaussianity.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1103.5707	high--frequency predictions for number counts and spectral properties of  extragalactic radio sources. new evidences of a break at mm wavelengths in  spectra of bright blazar sources	we present models to predict high frequency counts of extragalactic radiosources using physically grounded recipes to describe the complex spectralbehaviour of blazars, that dominate the mm-wave counts at bright fluxdensities. we show that simple power-law spectra are ruled out byhigh-frequency (nu&gt;100 ghz) data. these data also strongly constrain modelsfeaturing the spectral breaks predicted by classical physical models for thesynchrotron emission produced in jets of blazars (blandford &amp; konigl 1979;konigl 1981). a model dealing with blazars as a single population is, at best,only marginally consistent with data coming from current surveys at high radiofrequencies. our most successful model assumes different distributions of breakfrequencies, nu_m, for bl lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs). theformer objects have substantially higher values of nu_m, implying that thesynchrotron emission comes from more compact regions; therefore, a substantialincrease of the bl lac fraction at high radio frequencies and at bright fluxdensities is predicted. remarkably, our best model is able to give a very goodfit to all the observed data on number counts and on distributions of spectralindices of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies above 5 and up to 220ghz. predictions for the forthcoming sub-mm blazar counts from planck, at thehighest hfi frequencies, and from herschel surveys are also presented.

1105.6106	constraints on general primordial non-gaussianity using wavelets for the  wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-year data	we present constraints on the non-linear coupling parameter fnl with thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data. we use the method based onthe spherical mexican hat wavelet (smhw) to measure the fnl parameter for threeof the most interesting shapes of primordial non-gaussianity: local,equilateral and orthogonal. our results indicate that this parameter iscompatible with a gaussian distribution within the two sigma confidence level(cl) for the three shapes and the results are consistent with the valuespresented by the wmap team. we have included in our analysis the impact on fnldue to contamination by unresolved point sources. the point sources add apositive contribution of delta(fnl) = 2.5 \pm 3.0, delta(fnl) = 37 \pm 18 anddelta(fnl) = 25 \pm 14 for the local, equilateral and orthogonal casesrespectively. as mentioned by the wmap team, the contribution of the pointsources to the orthogonal and equilateral form is expected to be larger thanthe local one and thus it cannot be neglected in future constraints on theseparameters. taking into account this contamination, our best estimates for fnlare -16.0 \leq fnl \leq 76.0, -382 \leq fnl \leq 202 and -394 \leq fnl \leq 34at 95% cl for the local, equilateral and orthogonal cases respectively. thethree shapes are compatible with zero at 95% cl (2{\sigma}). our conclusion isthat the wmap 7-year data are consistent with gaussian primordial fluctuationswithin ~2{\sigma} cl. we stress however the importance of taking into accountthe unresolved point sources in the measurement of fnl in future works,especially when using more precise data sets such as the forthcoming planckdata.

1111.3390	the effect of the linear term on the wavelet estimator of primordial  non-gaussianity	in this work we present constraints on different shapes of primordialnon-gaussianity using the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) 7-yeardata and the spherical mexican hat wavelet fnl estimator including the linearterm correction. in particular we focus on the local, equilateral andorthogonal shapes. we first analyse the main statistical properties of thewavelet estimator and show the conditions to reach optimality. we include thelinear term correction in our estimators and compare the estimates with thevalues already published using only the cubic term. the estimators are testedwith realistic wmap simulations with anisotropic noise and the wmap kq75 skycut. the inclusion of the linear term correction shows a negligible improvement(&lt; 1 per cent) in the error-bar for any of the shapes considered. the resultsof this analysis show that, in the particular case of the wavelet estimator,the optimality for wmap anisotropy levels is basically achieved with the meansubtraction and in practical terms there is no need of including a linear termonce the mean has been subtracted. our best estimates are now: local fnl = 39.0+/ 21.4, equilateral fnl = -62.8 +/- 154.0 and orthogonal fnl = -159.8 +/-115.1 (all cases 68 per cent cl). we have also computed the expected linearterm correction for simulated planck maps with anisotropic noise at 143 ghzfollowing the planck sky model and including a mask. the improvement achievedin this case for the local fnl error-bar is also negligible (0.4 per cent).

0704.3158	cosmological applications of a wavelet analysis on the sphere	the cosmic microwave background (cmb) is a relic radiation of the big bangand as such it contains a wealth of cosmological information. statisticalanalyses of the cmb, in conjunction with other cosmological observables,represent some of the most powerful techniques available to cosmologists forplacing strong constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe theorigin, content and evolution of the universe. the last decade has witnessedthe introduction of wavelet analyses in cosmology and, in particular, theirapplication to the cmb. we review here spherical wavelet analyses of the cmbthat test the standard cosmological concordance model. the assumption that thetemperature anisotropies of the cmb are a realisation of a statisticallyisotropic gaussian random field on the sphere is questioned. deviations fromboth statistical isotropy and gaussianity are detected in the reviewed works,suggesting more exotic cosmological models may be required to explain ouruniverse. we also review spherical wavelet analyses that independently provideevidence for dark energy, an exotic component of our universe of which we knowvery little currently. the effectiveness of accounting correctly for thegeometry of the sphere in the wavelet analysis of full-sky cmb data isdemonstrated by the highly significant detections of physical processes andeffects that are made in these reviewed works.

1203.3277	an optimal estimator for the cmb-lss angular power spectrum and its  application to wmap and nvss data	we use a quadratic maximum likelihood (qml) method to estimate the angularpower spectrum of the cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background andlarge scale structure maps as well as their individual auto-spectra. wedescribe our implementation of this method and demonstrate its accuracy onsimulated maps. we apply this optimal estimator to wmap 7-year and nrao vla skysurvey (nvss) data and explore the robustness of the angular power spectrumestimates obtained by the qml method. with the correction of the declinationsystematics in nvss, we can safely use most of the information contained inthis survey. we then make use of the angular power spectrum estimates obtainedby the qml method to derive constraints on the dark energy critical density ina flat $\lambda$cdm model by different likelihood prescriptions. when usingjust the cross-correlation between wmap 7 year and nvss maps with 1.8$^\circ$resolution, the best-fit model has a cosmological constant of approximatively70% of the total energy density, disfavouring an einstein-de sitter universe atmore than 2 $\sigma$ cl (confidence level).

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

0704.3736	alignment and signed-intensity anomalies in wmap data	significant alignment and signed-intensity anomalies of local features of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) are detected on the three-year wmap data,through a decomposition of the signal with steerable wavelets on the sphere.firstly, an alignment analysis identifies two mean preferred planes in the sky,both with normal axes close to the cmb dipole axis. the first plane is definedby the directions toward which local cmb features are anomalously aligned. amean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to theecliptic poles axis. the second plane is defined by the directions anomalouslyavoided by local cmb features. this alignment anomaly provides further insighton recent results (wiaux et al. 2006). secondly, a signed-intensity analysisidentifies three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemispherewith anomalously high or low temperature of local cmb features: a cold spotessentially identified with a known cold spot (vielva et al. 2004), a secondcold spot lying very close to the southern end of the cmb dipole axis, and ahot spot lying close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis. in bothanalyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angularsizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significancelevels around 1%. further investigation reveals that the alignment andsigned-intensity anomalies are only very partially related. instrumental noise,foreground emissions, as well as some form of other systematics, are stronglyrejected as possible origins of the detections. an explanation might still beenvisaged in terms of a global violation of the isotropy of the universe,inducing an intrinsic statistical anisotropy of the cmb.

1301.1544	forecasts on the contamination induced by unresolved point sources in  primordial non-gaussianity beyond planck	in this paper we present forecasts of the contamination on different shapesof the primordial non-gaussianity fnl parameter -- detectable on future cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) high--resolution anisotropy maps -- produced byunresolved extragalactic point sources at frequencies of cosmological interest(45--375 ghz). we consider two scenarios: an ideal (noiseless) mission and apossible future space-borne satellite, with instrumental characteristicssimilar to the ones proposed for the cosmic origins explorer (core). the local,equilateral, orthogonal and flat shapes are considered in both temperature(intensity) and polarized emission data. the angular power spectrum andbispectrum of extragalactic point sources are estimated by state-of-the-artmodels of source number counts. the impact of all the most relevant (far--irand radio selected) source populations on these shapes at core frequencies isstudied. the results of this analysis show that unresolved extragalactic pointsources should not induce a very relevant non-gaussian signal in the frequencyrange 100--200 ghz, thus not preventing a correct estimate of the cmbprimordial fnl parameter. polarization information allows one to significantlyreduce the error--bars in the fnl parameter and the bias induced by unresolvedsources and, hence, to widen the range of frequencies for fnl studies. on thecontrary, at nu &lt; 100 ghz or nu &gt; 225 ghz, important non-gaussian deviations incmb anisotropy maps are expected due to unresolved extragalactic sources.

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5090	planck intermediate results. xiii. constraints on peculiar velocities	using \planck\ data combined with the meta catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc), we address the study of peculiar motions bysearching for evidence of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). byimplementing various filters designed to extract the ksz generated at thepositions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radialpeculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flowamplitude at different depths. for the whole cluster sample of average redshift0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the ksz monopole,amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. this constitutes less than 1% of therelative hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local cmbframe. while the linear $\lambda$cdm prediction for the typical cluster radialvelocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by\planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \planck\ data also set strongconstraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the local group. thereis no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending tothe maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. a blind search for bulkflows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidencelevel) dominated by cmb confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that theuniverse is largely homogeneous on gpc scales. in this context, in conjunctionwith supernova observations, \planck\ is able to rule out a large class ofinhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.the \planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thusconsistent with the $\lambda$cdm scenario.

1405.7029	the cib-lensing bispectrum: impact on primordial non-gaussianity and  detectability for the planck mission	we characterize the cosmic infrared background (cib)-lensing bispectrum whichis one of the contributions to the three-point functions of cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) maps in harmonic space. we show that the cib-lensingbispectrum has a considerable strength and that it can be detected with highsignificance in the planck high-frequency maps. we also present forecasts ofthe contamination on different shapes of the primordial non-gaussianity$f_{nl}$ parameter produced by the cib-lensing bispectrum and by theextragalactic point sources bispectrum in the planck high-resolution cmbanisotropy maps. the local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes are consideredfor 'raw' single-frequency (i.e., without applying any component separationtechnique) and foreground-reduced planck temperature maps. the cib-lensingcorrelation seems to mainly affect orthogonal shapes of the bispectrum - with{\delta}$f_{nl}$ = -21 and -88 for the 143 and 217 ghz bands respectively -while point sources mostly impact equilateral shapes, with {\delta}$f_{nl}$ =160, 54 and 60 at 100, 143 and 217 ghz. however, the results indicate thatthese contaminants do not induce any relevant bias on planck $f_{nl}$ estimateswhen foreground-reduced maps are considered: using sevem for the componentseparation we obtain {\delta}$f_{nl}$ = 10.5 due to the cib-lensing and{\delta}$f_{nl}$ = 30.4 due to point sources, corresponding to 0.30{\sigma} and0.45{\sigma} in terms of the planck 2013 $f_{nl}$ uncertainty. the componentseparation technique is, in fact, able to partially clean the extragalacticsource contamination and the bias is reduced for all the shapes. we havefurther developed single- and multiple-frequency estimators based on thekomatsu, spergel &amp; wandelt (2005) formalism that can be implemented toefficiently detect this signal.

0804.0136	constraints on the non-linear coupling parameter fnl with the archeops  data	we present a gaussianity analysis of the archeops cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature anisotropy data maps at high resolution to constrain thenon-linear coupling parameter fnl characterising well motivated non-gaussiancmb models. we used the data collected by the most sensitive archeops bolometerat 143 ghz. the instrumental noise was carefully characterised for thisbolometer, and for another archeops bolometer at 143 ghz used for comparison.angular scales from 27 arcmin to 1.8 degrees and a large fraction of the sky,21 %, covering both hemispheres (avoiding pixels with galactic latitude |b| &lt;15 degrees) were considered.  the three minkowski functionals on the sphere evaluated at differentthresholds were used to construct a chi-squared statistics for both thegaussian and the non-gaussian cmb models. the archeops maps were produced withthe mirage optimal map-making procedure from processed time ordered data. theanalysis is based on simulations of signal (gaussian and non-gaussian fnl cmbmodels) and noise which were processed in the time domain using the archeopspipeline and projected on the sky using the mirage optimal map-makingprocedure.  the archeops data were found to be compatible with gaussianity after removalof highly noisy pixels at high resolution. the non-linear coupling parameterwas constrained to -400 &lt; fnl &lt; 590 at 68% cl and -920 &lt; fnl &lt; 1075 at 95% cl,for realistic non-gaussian cmb simulations.

1502.01586	planck 2015 results. vii. hfi toi and beam processing	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has observed the full sky at sixfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 ghz) in intensity and at fourfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 ghz). in order toobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (toi) containing the detector andpointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.the full mission toi is included in the planck 2015 release. this paperdescribes the hfi toi and beam processing for the 2015 release. hfi calibrationand map-making are described in a companion paper. the main pipeline has beenmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), byincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and byimproving the model of the bolometer time response. the beam processing is anessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the planck sciencepapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window functionuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. noisecorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed usingdedicated simulations. angular cross-power spectra using datasets that aredecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1508.03375	planck 2013 results. xxxi. consistency of the planck data	the planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancythat can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. one of the mostimportant is the comparison of the 70ghz and 100ghz channels. based ondifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focalplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, andnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effecttwo different experiments. the 143ghz channel has the lowest noise level onplanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. in thispaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 planck data. weconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143ghz channel maps and powerspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acousticpeaks, on maps masked for diffuse galactic emission and for strong unresolvedsources. difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin areconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave backgroundstructure. including small but important corrections for unresolved-sourceresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100ghz power spectraaveraged over 70&lt;l&lt;390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100ghzpower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. these values are within andconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the planck2013 results. we also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysisshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217ghz power spectra. weanalyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of thesedifferences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errorsthat could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertaintiesstill further. several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

0807.0231	wmap 5-year constraints on fnl with wavelets	we present a gaussianity analysis of the wmap 5-year cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature anisotropy data maps. we use several third orderestimators based on the spherical mexican hat wavelet. we impose constraints onthe local non-linear coupling parameter fnl using well motivated non-gaussiansimulations. we analyse the wmap maps at resolution of 6.9 arcmin for the q, v,and w frequency bands. we use the kq75 mask recommended by the wmap team whichmasks out 28% of the sky. the wavelet coefficients are evaluated at 10different scales from 6.9 to 150 arcmin. with these coefficients we compute thethird order estimators which are used to perform a chi-squared analysis. thechi-squared statistic is used to test the gaussianity of the wmap data as wellas to constrain the fnl parameter. our results indicate that the wmap data arecompatible with the gaussian simulations, and the fnl parameter is constrainedto -8 &lt; fnl &lt; +111 at 95% cl for the combined v+w map. this value has beencorrected for the presence of undetected point sources, which add a positivecontribution of delta_fnl = 3+-5 in the v+w map. our results are very similarto those obtained by komatsu et al (2008) using the bispectrum.

astro-ph;0009042	constraining our universe with x-ray &amp; optical cluster data	we have used recent x-ray and optical data in order to impose someconstraints on the cosmology and cluster scaling relations. generically twokind of hypotheses define our model. first we consider that the clusterpopulation is well described by the standard press-schechter (ps) formalism,and second, these clusters are supposed to follow scaling relations with mass:temperature-mass (t-m) and x-ray luminosity-mass (l_x - m). as a differencewith many other authors we do not assume specific scaling relations to modelcluster properties such as the usual $t-m$ virial relation or one observationaldetermination of the $l_x-t$ relation. instead we consider general freeparameter scaling relations. with the previous model (ps plus scalings) we fitour free parameters to several x-ray and optical data with the advantage overmany other works that we consider all the data sets at the same time. thisprevents us from being inconsistent with some of the available observations.among other interesting conclusions, we find that only low-density universesare compatible with all the data considered and that the degeneracy between$\omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ is broken. also we obtain interesting limits on theparameters characterizing the scaling relations.

astro-ph;0104077	predicted planck extragalactic point source catalogue	an estimation of the number and amplitude (in flux) of the extragalacticpoint sources that will be observed by the planck mission is presented in thispaper. the study is based on the mexican hat wavelet formalism introduced bycayon et al. 2000. simulations at planck observing frequencies are analysed,taking into account all the possible cosmological, galactic and extragalacticemissions together with noise. with the technique used in this work the planckmission will produce a catalogue of extragalactic point sources above fluxes:1.03 jy (857 ghz), 0.53 jy (545 ghz), 0.28 jy (353 ghz), 0.24 jy (217 ghz),0.32 jy (143 ghz), 0.41 jy (100 ghz hfi), 0.34 jy (100 ghz lfi), 0.57 jy (70ghz), 0.54 jy (44 ghz) and 0.54 jy (30 ghz), which are only slightly modeldependent (see text). amplitudes of these sources are estimated with errorsbelow 15%. moreover, we also provide a complete catalogue (for the pointsources simulation analysed) with errors in the estimation of the amplitudebelow 10%. in addition we discuss the possibility of identifying differentpoint source populations in the planck catalogue by estimating their spectralindices.

astro-ph;0203485	point source detection and extraction from simulated planck tod using  optimal adaptive filters	wavelet-related techniques have proven useful in the processing and analysisof one and two dimensional data sets (spectra in the former case, images in thelatter). in this work we apply adaptive filters, introduced in a previous work(sanz et al. 2001), to optimize the detection and extraction of point sourcesfrom a one-dimensional array of time-ordered data such as the one that will beproduced by the future 30 ghz lfi28 channel of the esa planck mission. at a$4\sigma$ detection level 224 sources over a flux of 0.88 jy are detected witha mean relative error (in absolute value) of 21% and a systematic bias of-7.7%. the position of the sources in the sky is determined with errorsinferior to the size of the pixel. the catalogue of detected sources iscomplete at fluxes $\geq$ 4.3 jy. the number of spurious detections is lessthan a 10% of the true detections. we compared the results with the onesobtained by filtering with a gaussian filter and a mexican hat wavelet of widthequal to the scale of the sources. the adaptive filter outperforms the otherfilters in all considered cases. we conclude that optimal adaptive filters arewell suited to detect and extract sources with a given profile embedded in abackground of known statistical properties. in the planck case, they could beuseful to obtain a real-time preliminary catalogue of extragalactic sources,which would have a great scientific interest, e. g. for follow-up observations.

astro-ph;0203486	filtering techniques for the detection of sunyaev-zel'dovich clusters in  multifrequency cmb maps	the problem of detecting sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) clusters in multifrequencycmb observations is investigated using a number of filtering techniques. amultifilter approach is introduced, which optimizes the detection of szclusters on microwave maps. an alternative method is also investigated, inwhich maps at different frequencies are combined in an optimal manner so thatexisting filtering techniques can be applied to the single combined map. the szprofiles are approximated by the circularly-symmetric template $\tau (x) = [1+(x/r_c)^2]^{-\lambda}$, with $\lambda \simeq \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $x\equiv|\vec{x}|$, where the core radius $r_c$ and the overall amplitude of the effectare not fixed a priori, but are determined from the data. the backgroundemission is modelled by a homogeneous and isotropic random field, characterizedby a cross-power spectrum $p_{\nu_1 \nu_2}(q)$ with $q\equiv |\vec{q}|$. thefiltering methods are illustrated by application to simulated planckobservations of a $12.8^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$ patch of sky in 10 frequencychannels. our simulations suggest that the planck instrument should detect$\approx 10000$ sz clusters in 2/3 of the sky. moreover, we find the catalogueto be complete for fluxes $s &gt; 170$ mjy at 300 ghz.

astro-ph;0302094	cmb power spectrum estimation and map reconstruction with the  expectation - maximization algorithm	we apply the iterative expectation-maximization algorithm (em) to estimatethe power spectrum of the cmb from multifrequency microwave maps. in addition,we are also able to provide a reconstruction of the cmb map. by assuming thatthe combined emission of the foregrounds plus the instrumental noise isgaussian distributed in fourier space, we have simplified the em procedurefinding an analytical expression for the maximization step. by using thesimplified expression the cpu time can be greatly reduced. we test thestability of our power spectrum estimator with realistic simulations of planckdata, including point sources and allowing for spatial variation of thefrequency dependence of the galactic emissions. without prior information aboutany of the components, our new estimator can recover the cmb power spectrum upto scales l~1500 with less than 10% error. this result is significantlyimproved if the brightest point sources are removed before applying ourestimator. in this way, the cmb power spectrum can be recovered up to l~1700with 10% error and up to l~2100 with 50% error. this result is very close tothe one that would be obtained in the ideal case of only cmb plus white noise,for which all our assumptions are satisfied. moreover, the em algorithm alsoprovides an straightforward mechanism to reconstruct the cmb map. the recoveredcosmological signal shows a high degree of correlation (r = 0.98) with theinput map and low residuals.

astro-ph;0306164	goodness-of-fit tests to study the gaussianity of the maxima data	goodness-of-fit tests, including smooth ones, are introduced and applied todetect non-gaussianity in cosmic microwave background simulations. we study thepower of three different tests: the shapiro-francia test (1972), theuncategorised smooth test developed by rayner and best(1990) and the neyman'ssmooth goodness-of-fit test for composite hypotheses (thomas and pierce 1979).the smooth goodness-of-fit tests are designed to be sensitive to the presenceof ``smooth'' deviations from a given distribution. we study the power of thesetests based on the discrimination between gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations. non-gaussian cases are simulated using the edgeworth expansion andassuming pixel-to-pixel independence. results show these tests behave similarlyand are more powerful than tests directly based on cumulants of order 3, 4, 5and 6. we have applied these tests to the released maxima data. the appliedtests are built to be powerful against detecting deviations from univariategaussianity. the cholesky matrix corresponding to signal (based on an assumedcosmological model) plus noise is used to decorrelate the observations previousto the analysis. results indicate that the maxima data are compatible withgaussianity.

astro-ph;0307073	predictions on high frequency polarization properties of extragalactic  radio sources and implications for cmb polarization measurements	we present a method to simulate the polarization properties of extragalacticradio sources at microwave frequencies. polarization measurements of nearly2x10^6 sources at 1.4 ghz are provided by the nvss survey. using this catalogueand the gb6 survey, we study the distribution of the polarization degree ofboth steep- and flat-spectrum sources. we find that the polarization degree isanti-correlated with the flux density for the former population, while nocorrelation is detected for the latter. the available high-frequency data areexploited to determine the frequency dependence of the distribution ofpolarization degrees. using such information and the evolutionary model bytoffolatti et al. (1998), we estimate the polarization power spectrum ofextragalactic radio sources at \geq 30 ghz and their contamination of cmbpolarization maps. two distinct methods to compute point-source polarizationspectra are presented, extending and improving the one generally used inprevious analyses. while extragalactic radio sources can significantlycontaminate the cmb e-mode power spectrum only at low frequencies (&lt;30 ghz),they can severely constrain the detectability of the cmb b-mode up to ~100 ghz.

astro-ph;0309586	goodness-of-fit tests of gaussianity: constraints on the cumulants of  the maxima data	in this work, goodness-of-fit tests are adapted and applied to cmb maps todetect possible non-gaussianity. we use shapiro-francia test and two smoothgoodness-of-fit tests: one developed by rayner and best and another onedeveloped by thomas and pierce. the smooth tests test small and smoothdeviations of a prefixed probability function (in our case this is theunivariate gaussian). also, the rayner and best test informs us of the kind ofnon-gaussianity we have: excess of skewness, of kurtosis, and so on. thesetests are optimal when the data are independent. we simulate and analysenon-gaussian signals in order to study the power of these tests. thesenon-gaussian simulations are constructed using the edgeworth expansion, andassuming pixel-to-pixel independence. as an application, we test thegaussianity of the maxima data. results indicate that the maxima data arecompatible with gaussianity. finally, the values of the skewness and kurtosisof maxima data are constrained by |s| \le 0.035 and |k| \le 0.036 at the 99%confidence level.

astro-ph;0310273	detection of non-gaussianity in the wmap 1-year data using spherical  wavelets	a non-gaussian detection in the wmap 1-year data is reported. the detectionhas been found in the combined q-v-w map proposed by the wmap team (komatsu etal. 2003) after applying a wavelet technique based on the spherical mexican hatwavelet (smhw). the skewness and the kurtosis of the smhw coefficients arecalculated at different scales. a non-gaussian signal is detected at scales ofthe smhw around 4 deg (size in the sky of around 10 deg). the right tailprobability of the detection is approx. 0.4%. in addition, a study ofgaussianity is performed in each hemisphere. the northern hemisphere iscompatible with gaussianity, whereas the southern one deviates from gaussianitywith a right tail probability of approx. 0.1%. systematics, foregrounds anduncertainties in the estimation of the cosmological parameters are carefullystudied in order to identify the possible source of non-gaussianity. thedetected deviation from gaussianity is not found to be caused by systematiceffects: 1) each one of the q, v and w receivers shows the same non-gaussianitypattern, and 2) several combinations of the different receivers at eachfrequency band do not show this non-gaussian pattern. similarly, galacticforegrounds show a negligible contribution to the non-gaussian detection:non-gaussianity is detected in all the wmap maps and no frequency dependence isobserved. moreover, the expected foreground contribution to the combined wmapmap was added to cmb gaussian simulations showing a behaviour compatible withthe gaussian model. influence of uncertainties in the cmb power spectrumestimation are also quantified. hence, possible intrinsic temperaturefluctuations (like secondary anisotropies and primordial features) can not berejected as the source of this non-gaussian detection.

astro-ph;0405341	detection of a non-gaussian spot in wmap	an extremely cold and big spot in the wmap 1-year data is analyzed. our workis a continuation of a previous paper (vielva et al. 2004) wherenon-gaussianity was detected, with a method based on the spherical mexican hatwavelet (smhw) technique. we study the spots at different thresholds on thesmhw coefficient maps, considering six estimators, namely number of maxima,number of minima, number of hot and cold spots, and number of pixels of thespots. at smhw scales around 4 degrees (10 degrees on the sky), the datadeviate from gaussianity. the analysis is performed on all sky, the northernand southern hemispheres, and on four regions covering all the sky. a cold spotat (b = -57, l = 209) is found to be the source of this non-gaussian signature.we compare the spots of our data with 10000 gaussian simulations, and concludethat only around 0.2% of them present such a cold spot. excluding this spot,the remaining map is compatible with gaussianity and even the excess ofkurtosis in vielva et al. 2004, is found to be due exclusively to this spot.finally, we study whether the spot causing the observed deviation fromgaussianity could be generated by systematics or foregrounds. none of them seemto be responsible for the non-gaussian detection.

astro-ph;0408252	cross-correlation of the cmb and radio galaxies in real, harmonic and  wavelet spaces: detection of the integrated sachs-wolfe effect and dark  energy constraints	we report the first detection of the isw effect in wavelet space, at scalesin the sky around 7 degrees with a significance of around 3.3 sigma, bycross-correlating the wmap first-year data and the nrao vla sky survey (nvss).in addition, we present a detailed comparison among the capabilities of threedifferent techniques for two different objectives: to detect the isw and to putconstraints in the nature of the dark energy. the three studied techniques are:the cross-angular power spectrum (caps, harmonic space), the correlationfunction (ccf, real space) and the covariance of the spherical mexican hatwavelet (smhw) coefficients (csmhw, wavelet space). we prove that the csmhw isexpected to provide a higher detection of the isw effect for a certain scale.this prediction has been corroborated by the analysis of the data. the smhwanalysis shows that the cross-correlation signal is caused neither bysystematic effects nor foreground contamination. however, by taking intoaccount the information encoded in all the multipoles/scales/angles, the capsprovides slightly better constraints than the smhw in the cosmologicalparameters that define the nature of the dark energy. the limits provided bythe ccf are wider than for the other two methods. two different cases have beenstudied: 1) a flat lambda-cdm universe and 2) a flat universe with an equationof state parameter different from -1. in the first case, the caps provides (fora bias value of b = 1.6) 0.59 &lt; lambda density &lt; 0.84 (at 1 sigma cl).moreover, the caps rejects the range lambda density &lt; 0.1 at 3.5 sigma, whichis the highest detection of the dark energy reported up to date. in the secondcase, the caps gives 0.50 &lt; dark energy density &lt; 0.82 and -1.16 &lt; w &lt; 0.43 (at1 sigma cl).

astro-ph;0411154	gaussianity of the cmb: smooth goodness of fit tests applied to  interferometric data	we adapt the smooth tests of goodness of fit developed by rayner and best tothe study of the non-gaussianity of interferometric observations of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb). the interferometric measurements (visibilities) aretransformed into signal-to-noise eigenmodes, and then the method is applieddirectly in fourier space. this transformation allows us to perform theanalysis in different subsets of eigenmodes according to their signal-to-noiselevel. the method can also deal with non-uniform or incomplete coverage of theuv plane. we explore here two possibilities: we analyse either the real andimaginary parts of the complex visibilities (gaussianly distributed under thegaussianity hypothesis) or their phases (uniformly distributed under thegaussianity hypothesis). the power of the method in discriminating betweengaussian and non-gaussian distributions is studied by using several kinds ofnon-gaussian simulations. on the one hand, we introduce a certain degree ofnon-gaussianity directly into the fourier space using the edgeworth expansion,and afterwards the desired correlation is introduced. on the other hand, weconsider interferometric observations of a map with topological defects (cosmicstrings). to these previous non-gaussian simulations we add different noiselevels and quantify the required signal-to-noise ratio necessary to achieve adetection of these non-gaussian features. finally, we have also studied theability of the method to constrain the so-called nonlinear coupling constantf_{nl} using chi^2 simulations.the whole method is illustrated here byapplication to simulated data from the very small array interferometer.

astro-ph;0411567	limits on the detectability of the cmb b-mode polarization imposed by  foregrounds	we investigate which practical constraints are imposed by foregrounds to thedetection of the b-mode polarization generated by gravitational waves in thecase of experiments of the type currently being planned. because the b-modesignal is probably dominated by foregrounds at all frequencies, the detectionof the cosmological component depends drastically on our ability for removingforegrounds. we provide an analytical expression to estimate the level of theresidual polarization for galactic foregrounds, according to the methodemployed for their subtraction. we interpret this result in terms of the lowerlimit of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r that allows to disentangle thecosmological b-mode polarization from the foregrounds contribution. polarizedemission from extragalactic radio sources and gravitational lensing is alsotaken into account. as a first approach, we consider the ideal limit of aninstrumental noise--free experiment: for a full--sky coverage and a degreeresolution, we obtain a limit of r~10^(-4). this value can be improved byhigh--resolution experiments and, in principle, no clear fundamental limit onthe detectability of gravitational waves polarization is found. our analysis isalso applied to planned or hypothetical future polarization experiments, takinginto account expected noise levels.

astro-ph;0503039	effect of component separation on the temperature distribution of the  cmb	we present a study of the effect of component separation on the recoveredcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature distribution, consideringgaussian and non-gaussian input cmb maps. first, we extract the cmb componentfrom simulated planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximumentropy method (mem), wiener filter (wf) and a method based on the subtractionof foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (lcfc).we then apply a wavelet-based method to study the gaussianity of the recoveredcmb and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. when the originalcmb map is gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), wefind that none of the methods introduce non-gaussianity (ng) in the cmbreconstruction. on the contrary, if the input cmb map is non-gaussian, all thestudied methods produce a reconstructed cmb with lower detections of ng thanthe original map. this effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumentalnoise. in this case, mem tends to produce slightly higher non-gaussiandetections in the reconstructed map than wf whereas the detections are lowerfor the lcfc. we have also studied the effect of point sources in the memreconstruction. if no attempt to remove point sources is performed, theyclearly contaminate the cmb reconstruction, introducing spurious ng. when thebrightest point sources are removed from the data using the mexican hatwavelet, the gaussian character of the cmb is preserved. however, whenanalysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will beappreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals tointroduce spurious ng in the cmb. thus, a careful subtraction (or masking) ofpoint source emission is crucial when studying the gaussianity of the cmb.

astro-ph;0510003	the cosmic microwave background anisotropies: open problems	the standard inflationary model presents a simple scenario within which thehomogeneity, isotropy and flatness of the universe appear as natural outcomesand, in addition, fluctuations in the energy density are originated during theinflationary phase. these seminal density fluctuations give rise tofluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) at thedecoupling surface. afterward, the cmb photons propagate almost freely, withslight gravitational interactions with the evolving gravitational field presentin the large scale structure (lss) of the matter distribution and a lowscattering rate with free electrons after the universe becomes reionized. thesesecondary effects slightly change the shape of the intensity and polarizationangular power spectra (aps) of the radiation. the aps contain very valuableinformation on the parameters characterizing the background model of theuniverse and those parametrising the power spectra of both matter densityperturbations and gravitational waves. in the last few years data fromsensitive experiments have allowed a good determination of the shape of theaps, providing for the first time a model of the universe very close tospatially flat. in particular the wmap first year data, together with other cmbdata at higher resolution and other cosmological data sets, have made possibleto determine the cosmological parameters with a precision of a few percent. themost striking aspect of the derived model of the universe is the unknown natureof most of its energy contents. this and other open problems in cosmologyrepresent exciting challenges for the cmb community. the future esa planckmission will undoubtely shed some light on these remaining questions.

astro-ph;0601427	the non-gaussian cold spot in wmap: significance, morphology and  foreground contribution	the non--gaussian cold spot in the 1-year wmap data, described in vielva etal. and cruz et al., is analysed in detail in the present paper. first of all,we perform a more rigorous calculation of the significance of the non-zerokurtosis detected in wmap maps by vielva et al. in wavelet space, mainlygenerated by the spot. we confirm the robustness of that detection, since theprobability of obtaining this deviation by chance is 0.69%. afterwards, themorphology of the spot is studied by applying spherical mexican hat waveletswith different ellipticities. the shape of the spot is found to be almostcircular. finally, we discuss if the observed non-gaussianity in wavelet spacecan arise from bad subtracted foreground residues in the wmap maps. we showthat the flat frequency dependence of the spot cannot be explained by a thermalsunyaev-zeldovich effect. based on our present knowledge of galactic foregroundemissions, we conclude that the significance of our detection is not affectedby galactic residues in the region of the spot. considering different galacticforeground estimates, the probability of finding such a big cold spot ingaussian simulations is always below 1%.

astro-ph;0602398	detection of the isw effect and corresponding dark energy constraints  made with directional spherical wavelets	using a directional spherical wavelet analysis we detect the integratedsachs-wolfe (isw) effect, indicated by a positive correlation between thefirst-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) and nrao vla sky survey(nvss) data. detections are made using both a directional extension of thespherical mexican hat wavelet and the spherical butterfly wavelet. we examinethe possibility of foreground contamination and systematics in the wmap dataand conclude that these factors are not responsible for the signal that wedetect. the wavelet analysis inherently enables us to localise on the sky thoseregions that contribute most strongly to the correlation. on removing theselocalised regions the correlation that we detect is reduced in significance, asexpected, but it is not eliminated, suggesting that these regions are not thesole source of correlation between the data. this finding is consistent withpredictions made using the isw effect, where one would expect weak correlationsover the entire sky. in a flat universe the detection of the isw effectprovides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. we use our detectionto constrain dark energy parameters by deriving a theoretical prediction forthe directional wavelet covariance statistic for a given cosmological model.comparing these predictions with the data we place constraints on theequation-of-state parameter $w$ and the vacuum energy density $\omega_\lambda$.we also consider the case of a pure cosmological constant, i.e. $w=-1$. forthis case we rule out a zero cosmological constant at greater than the 99.9%significance level. all parameter estimates that we obtain are consistent withthe standand cosmological concordance model values.

astro-ph;0603859	the non-gaussian cold spot in the 3-year wmap data	the non-gaussian cold spot detected in wavelet space in the wmap 1-year data,is detected again in the coadded wmap 3-year data at the same position (b =-57, l = 209) and size in the sky (around 10 degrees). the present analysis isbased on several statistical methods: kurtosis, maximum absolute temperature,number of pixels below a given threshold, volume and higher criticism. allthese methods detect deviations from gaussianity in the 3--year data set at aslightly higher confidence level than in the wmap 1-year data. these smalldifferences are mainly due to the new foreground reduction technique and not tothe reduction of the noise level, which is negligible at the scale of the spot.in order to avoid "a posteriori" analyses, we recalculate for the wmap 3-yeardata the significance of the deviation in the kurtosis. the skewness andkurtosis tests were the first tests performed with wavelets for the wmap data.we obtain that the probability of finding an at least as high deviation ingaussian simulations is 1.85%. the frequency dependence of the spot is shown tobe extremely flat. galactic foreground emissions are not likely to beresponsible for the detected deviation from gaussianity.

astro-ph;0609147	steerable wavelet analysis of cmb structures alignment	this paper reviews the application of a novel methodology for analysing theisotropy of the universe by probing the alignment of local structures in thecmb. the strength of the proposed methodology relies on the steerable waveletfiltering of the cmb signal. one the one hand, the filter steerability rendersthe computation of the local orientation of the cmb features affordable interms of computation time. on the other hand, the scale-space nature of thewavelet filtering allows to explore the alignment of the local structures atdifferent scales, probing possible different phenomena. we present the wmapfirst-year data analysis recently performed by the same authors (wiaux et al.),where an extremely significant anisotropy was found. in particular, a preferredplane was detected, having a normal direction with a northern end positionclose to the northern end of the cmb dipole axis. in addition, a most preferreddirection was found in that plane, with a northern end direction very close tothe north ecliptic pole. this result synthesised for the first time previouslyreported anomalies identified in the direction of the dipole and the eclipticpoles axes. in a forthcoming paper (vielva et al.), we have extended ouranalysis to the study of individual frequency maps finding first indicationsfor discarding foregrounds as the origin of the anomaly. we have also testedthat the preferred orientations are defined by structures homogeneouslydistributed in the sky, rather than from localised regions. we have alsoanalysed the wmap 3-year data, finding the same anomaly pattern, although at aslightly lower significance level.

astro-ph;0612148	testing gaussianity on archeops data	a gaussianity analysis using a goodness-of-fit test and the minkowskifunctionals on the sphere has been performed to study the measured archeopscosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature anisotropy data for a 143 ghzarcheops bolometer. we consider large angular scales, greater than 1.8 degrees,and a large fraction of the north galactic hemisphere, around 16%, with agalactic latitude b &gt; 15 degrees.  the considered goodness-of-fit test, first proposed by rayner &amp; best (1989),has been applied to the data after a signal-to-noise decomposition. the threeminkowski functionals on the sphere have been used to construct a chi-squarestatistic using different thresholds. the first method has been calibratedusing simulations of archeops data containing the cmb signal and instrumentalnoise in order to check its asymptotic convergence. two kind of maps producedwith two different map-making techniques (coaddition and mirage) have beenanalysed.  archeops maps for both mirage and coaddition map-making, have been found tobe compatible with gaussianity. from these results we can exclude a dust andatmospheric contamination larger than 7.8% (90% cl). also the non-linearcoupling parameter f_{nl} can be constrained to be -800 &lt; f_{nl} &lt; 1100 at the95% cl and on angular scales of 1.8 degrees. for comparison, the same methodhas been applied to data from the nasa wmap satellite in the same region ofsky. the 1-year and 3-year releases have been used. results are compatible withthose obtained with archeops, implying in particular an upper limit for f_{nl}on degree angular scales.

astro-ph;9502066	genus and spot density in the cobe dmr first year anisotropy maps	a statistical analysis of texture on the {\it cobe}-dmr first year sky mapsbased on the genus and spot number is presented. a generalized $\chi^2$statistic is defined in terms of ``observable'' quantities: the genus and spotdensity that would be measured by different cosmic observers. this strategytogether with the use of monte carlo simulations of the temperaturefluctuations, including all the relevant experimental parameters, represent themain difference with previous analyses. based on the genus analysis we find astrong anticorrelation between the quadrupole amplitude $q_{rms-ps}$ and thespectral index $n$ of the density fluctuation power spectrum at recombinationof the form $q_{rms-ps}= 22.2 \pm 1.7 - (4.7 \pm 1.3) \times n\ \mu$k for fixed$n$, consistent with previous works. the result obtained based on the spotdensity is consistent with this $q_{rms-ps} (n)$ relation. in addition to theprevious results we have determined, using monte carlo simulations, the minimumuncertainty due to cosmic variance for the determination of the spectral indexwith the genus analysis. this uncertainty is $\delta n\approx 0.2$.

astro-ph;9609183	large scale qso-galaxy correlations for radio loud and optically  selected qso samples	we have studied the distribution of $b_j&lt;20.5$ galaxies from the roe/nrlcosmos/ukst catalogue around two samples of $z&gt;0.3$ qsos with similar redshiftdistributions. the first sample is formed by 144 radio-loud qsos from theparkes catalogue, and the other contains 167 optically selected qsos extractedfrom the large bright quasar survey. it is found that there is a $\approx99.0%$ significance level excess of cosmos/ukst galaxies around the pks qsos,whereas there is a marginal defect of galaxies around the lbqs qsos. when thedistribution of galaxies around both samples is compared, we found that thereis an overdensity of galaxies around the pks sample with respect to the lbqssample anticorrelated with the distance from the qsos at a $99.7%$ significancelevel. although this result apparently agrees with the predictions of thedouble magnification bias, it is difficult to explain by gravitational lensingeffects alone; dust in the foreground galaxies and selection effects in thedetection of lbqs qsos should be taken into account. it has been establishedthat the lines of sight to pks flat-spectrum qsos go through significativelyhigher foreground galaxy densities than the directions to lbqs quasars, whatmay be partially related with the reported reddening of pks qsos.

astro-ph;9810219	segregated optical-nir colour distributions of mds galaxies	we present a k survey of 29 fields covering approximately 90 arcmin^2 fromthe medium deep survey (mds) catalogue down to a completeness magnitude ofk=18.0 (limiting magnitude k=19.0). the morphology obtained by the mds teamusing high resolution images from hst/wfpc2 along with our nir observationsallow a colour-magnitude and colour-colour analysis that agrees in general withspectral evolution models (bruzual &amp; charlot 1998) especially if a reasonablerange of metallicities for the simple stellar populations used (0.2 &lt; z/zsolar&lt; 2.5) is considered. however, a significant population of spheroids was found,which appear bluer than expected, confirming previous observations (forbes etal. 1996, koo et al. 1996, glazebrook et al. 1998). this blueness mightpossibly signal the existence of non-negligible star formation in ellipticalsand bulges at medium redshift. a number counts calculation for differentmorphological types show disks become the dominant population at faintmagnitudes. the median redshift of the sample is z~0.2, from a photometricredshift estimation using v-k and i-k. a search for eros in the survey fieldwas also performed, with no detection of objects having i-k &gt; 4.5, setting anupper limit to the number density of eros at dn_{eros}/d\omega &lt; 0.011arcmin^{-2} (k &lt; 18.0).

astro-ph;9902134	partition function based analysis of cmb maps	we present an alternative method to analyse cosmic microwave background (cmb)maps. we base our analysis on the study of the partition function. thisfunction is used to examine the cmb maps making use of the differentinformation embedded at different scales and moments. using the partitionfunction in a likelihood analysis in two dimensions (q_rms,n), we find thebest-fitting model to the best data available at present the cobe--dmr 4 yearsdata set. by means of this analysis we find a maximum in the likelihoodfunction for n=1.8 (-0.65 +0.35) and q_rms-ps = 10 (-2.5 +3) muk (95 %confidence level) in agreement with the results of other similar analyses(smoot et al. 1994 (1 yr), bennet et al. 1996 (4 yr)). also making use of thepartition function we perform a multifractal analysis and study the possiblefractal nature of the cmb sky. we find that the measure used in the analysis isnot a fractal. finally, we use the partition function for testing thestatistical distribution of the cobe--dmr data set. we conclude that noevidence of non-gaussianity can be found by means of this method.
