math;0412063	incomplete quadratic exponential sums in several variables	we consider incomplete exponential sums in several variables of the forms(f,n,m) = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x_1 \in \{-1,1\}} ... \sum_{x_n \in \{-1,1\}}x_1 ... x_n e^{2\pi i f(x)/p}, where m&gt;1 is odd and f is a polynomial of degreed with coefficients in z/mz. we investigate the conjecture, originating in aproblem in computational complexity, that for each fixed d and m the maximumnorm of s(f,n,m) converges exponentially fast to 0 as n grows to infinity. theconjecture is known to hold in the case when m=3 and d=2, but existing methodsfor studying incomplete exponential sums appear to be insufficient to resolvethe question for an arbitrary odd modulus m, even when d=2. in the presentpaper we develop three separate techniques for studying the problem in the caseof quadratic f, each of which establishes a different special case of theconjecture. we show that a bound of the required sort holds for almost allquadratic polynomials, a stronger form of the conjecture holds for allquadratic polynomials with no more than 10 variables, and for arbitrarily manyvariables the conjecture is true for a class of quadratic polynomials having aspecial form.

math;0506462	the low lying zeros of a gl(4) and a gl(6) family of l-functions	we investigate the large weight (k --&gt; oo) limiting statistics for the lowlying zeros of a gl(4) and a gl(6) family of l-functions, {l(s,phi x f): f inh_k(1)} and {l(s,phi times sym^2 f): f in h_k(1)}; here phi is a fixed evenhecke-maass cusp form and h_k(1) is a hecke eigenbasis for the space h_k(1) ofholomorphic cusp forms of weight k for the full modular group. katz and sarnakconjecture that the behavior of zeros near the central point should be wellmodeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 of a classical compact group. bystudying the 1- and 2-level densities, we find evidence of underlyingsymplectic and so(even) symmetry, respectively. this should be contrasted withprevious results of iwaniec-luo-sarnak for the families {l(s,f): f in h_k(1)}and {l(s,sym^2f): f in h_k(1)}, where they find evidence of orthogonal andsymplectic symmetry, respectively. the present examples suggest a relationbetween the symmetry type of a family and that of its twistings, which will befurther studied in a subsequent paper. both the gl(4) and the gl(6) familiesabove have all even functional equations, and neither is naturally split froman orthogonal family. a folklore conjecture states that such families must besymplectic, which is true for the first family but false for the second. thusthe theory of low lying zeros is more than just a theory of signs of functionalequations. an analysis of these families suggest that it is the second momentof the satake parameters that determines the symmetry group.

math;0508150	investigations of zeros near the central point of elliptic curve  l-functions	we explore the effect of zeros at the central point on nearby zeros ofelliptic curve l-functions, especially for one-parameter families of rank rover q. by the birch and swinnerton dyer conjecture and silverman'sspecialization theorem, for t sufficiently large the l-function of each curvee_t in the family has r zeros (called the family zeros) at the central point.we observe experimentally a repulsion of the zeros near the central point, andthe repulsion increases with r. there is greater repulsion in the subset ofcurves of rank r+2 than in the subset of curves of rank r in a rank r family.for curves with comparable conductors, the behavior of rank 2 curves in a rank0 one-parameter family over q is statistically different from that of rank 2curves from a rank 2 family. unlike excess rank calculations, the repulsiondecreases markedly as the conductors increase, and we conjecture that the rfamily zeros do not repel in the limit. finally, the differences betweenadjacent normalized zeros near the central point are statistically independentof the repulsion, family rank and rank of the curves in the subset.specifically, the differences between adjacent normalized zeros arestatistically equal for all curves investigated with rank 0, 2 or 4 andcomparable conductors from one-parameter families of rank 0 or 2 over q.

math;0509698	a derivation of the pythagorean won-loss formula in baseball	it has been noted that in many professional sports leagues a good predictorof a team's won-loss percentage is bill james' pythagorean formula rsobs^c /(rsobs^c + raobs^c), where rsobs (resp. raobs) is the observed average numberof runs scored (allowed) per game and c is a constant for the league; forbaseball the best agreement is when c is about 1.82. we provide a theoreticaljustification for this formula and value of c by modelling the number of runsscored and allowed in baseball games as independent random variables drawn fromweibull distributions with the same b and c but different a; the probabilitydensity f(x;a,b,c) is 0 for x &lt; b and is (c/a) ((x-b)/a)^{c-1}exp(-((x-b)/a)^c) otherwise. this model leads to a predicted won-losspercentage of (rs-b)^c / ((rs-b)^c + (ra-b)^c); here rs (resp. ra) is the meanof the random variable corresponding to runs scored (allowed), and rs - b(resp. ra - b) is an estimator of rsobs (resp. raobs). an analysis of the 14american league teams from the 2004 baseball season shows that (1) given thatthe runs scored and allowed in a game cannot be equal, the runs scored andallowed are statistically independent; (2) the best fit weibull parametersattained from a least squares or a maximum likelihood analysis give good fits;least squares gives a mean value of c of 1.79 with a standard deviation of .09,and maximum likelihood gives a mean value of c of 1.74 with a standarddeviation of .06, which agree beautifully with the observed best value of 1.82attained by fitting rsobs^c / (rsobs^c + raobs^c) to the observed winningpercentages.

math;0512444	closed-form bayesian inferences for the logit model via polynomial  expansions	articles in marketing and choice literatures have demonstrated the need forincorporating person-level heterogeneity into behavioral models (e.g., logitmodels for multiple binary outcomes as studied here). however, the logitlikelihood extended with a population distribution of heterogeneity doesn'tyield closed-form inferences, and therefore numerical integration techniquesare relied upon (e.g., mcmc methods).  we present here an alternative, closed-form bayesian inferences for the logitmodel, which we obtain by approximating the logit likelihood via a polynomialexpansion, and then positing a distribution of heterogeneity from a flexiblefamily that is now conjugate and integrable. for problems where the responsecoefficients are independent, choosing the gamma distribution leads to rapidlyconvergent closed-form expansions; if there are correlations among thecoefficients one can still obtain rapidly convergent closed-form expansions bypositing a distribution of heterogeneity from a multivariate gammadistribution. the solution then comes from the moment generating function ofthe multivariate gamma distribution or in general from the multivariateheterogeneity distribution assumed.  closed-form bayesian inferences, derivatives (useful for elasticitycalculations), population distribution parameter estimates (useful forsummarization) and starting values (useful for complicated algorithms) arehence directly available. two simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy ofour approach.

(we also study convolved familiesof the form f x g_m for a fixed f.) under natural assumptions on the families(which hold in many cases) we can associate to each family l of l-functions asymmetry constant c_l equal to 0 (resp., 1 or -1) if the correspondinglow-lying zero statistics agree with those of the unitary (resp., symplectic ororthogonal) group. our main result is that c_{f x g} = c_g * c_g: the symmetrytype of the convolved family is the product of the symmetry types of the twofamilies. a similar statement holds for the convolved families f x g_m. weprovide examples built from dirichlet l-functions and holomorphic modular formsand their symmetric powers. an interesting special case is to convolve twofamilies of elliptic curves with rank. in this case the symmetry group of theconvolution is independent of the ranks, in accordance with the generalprinciple of multiplicativity of the symmetry constants (but the ranks persist,before taking the limit n,m --&gt; oo, as lower-order terms).

math;0611649	the distribution of the largest non-trivial eigenvalues in families of  random regular graphs	recently friedman proved alon's conjecture for many families of d-regulargraphs, namely that given any epsilon &gt; 0 `most' graphs have their largestnon-trivial eigenvalue at most 2 sqrt{d-1}+epsilon in absolute value; if theabsolute value of the largest non-trivial eigenvalue is at most 2 sqrt{d-1}then the graph is said to be ramanujan. these graphs have importantapplications in communication network theory, allowing the construction ofsuperconcentrators and nonblocking networks, coding theory and cryptography. asmany of these applications depend on the size of the largest non-trivialpositive and negative eigenvalues, it is natural to investigate theirdistributions. we show these are well-modeled by the beta=1 tracy-widomdistribution for several families. if the observed growth rates of the mean andstandard deviation as a function of the number of vertices holds in the limit,then in the limit approximately 52% of d-regular graphs from bipartite familiesshould be ramanujan, and about 27% from non-bipartite families (assuming thelargest positive and negative eigenvalues are independent).

0911.1830	an orthogonal test of the $l$-functions ratios conjecture, ii	recently conrey, farmer, and zirnbauer developed the l-functions ratiosconjecture, which gives a recipe that predicts a wealth of statistics, frommoments to spacings between adjacent zeros and values of l-functions. theproblem with this method is that several of its steps involve ignoring errorterms of size comparable to the main term; amazingly, the errors seem to canceland the resulting prediction is expected to be accurate up to square-rootcancellation. we prove the accuracy of the ratios conjecture's prediction forthe 1-level density of families of cuspidal newforms of constant sign (up tosquare-root agreement for support in (-1,1), and up to a power savings in(-2,2)), and discuss the arithmetic significance of the lower order terms. thisis the most involved test of the ratios conjecture's predictions to date, as itis known that the error terms dropped in some of the steps do not cancel, butrather contribute a main term! specifically, these are the non-diagonal termsin the petersson formula, which lead to a bessel-kloosterman sum whichcontributes only when the support of the fourier transform of the test functionexceeds (-1, 1).

0707.3417	when almost all sets are difference dominated	we investigate the relationship between the sizes of the sum and differencesets attached to a subset of {0,1,...,n}, chosen randomly according to abinomial model with parameter p(n), with n^{-1} = o(p(n)). we show that therandom subset is almost surely difference dominated, as n --&gt; oo, for anychoice of p(n) tending to zero, thus confirming a conjecture of martin ando'bryant. the proofs use recent strong concentration results.  furthermore, we exhibit a threshold phenomenon regarding the ratio of thesize of the difference- to the sumset. if p(n) = o(n^{-1/2}) then almost allsums and differences in the random subset are almost surely distinct, and inparticular the difference set is almost surely about twice as large as thesumset. if n^{-1/2} = o(p(n)) then both the sum and difference sets almostsurely have size (2n+1) - o(p(n)^{-2}), and so the ratio in question is almostsurely very close to one. if p(n) = c n^{-1/2} then as c increases from zero toinfinity (i.e., as the threshold is crossed), the same ratio almost surelydecreases continuously from two to one according to an explicitly givenfunction of c.  we also extend our results to the comparison of the generalized differencesets attached to an arbitrary pair of binary linear forms. for certain pairs offorms f and g, we show that there in fact exists a sharp threshold at c_{f,g}n^{-1/2}, for some computable constant c_{f,g}, such that one form almostsurely dominates below the threshold, and the other almost surely above it.  the heart of our approach involves using different tools to obtain strongconcentration of the sizes of the sum and difference sets about their meanvalues, for various ranges of the parameter p.

1008.3202	from fibonacci numbers to central limit type theorems	a beautiful theorem of zeckendorf states that every integer can be writtenuniquely as a sum of non-consecutive fibonacci numbers$\{f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. lekkerkerker proved that the average number ofsummands for integers in $[f_n, f_{n+1})$ is $n/(\phi^2 + 1)$, with $\phi$ thegolden mean. this has been generalized to the following: given nonnegativeintegers $c_1,c_2,...,c_l$ with $c_1,c_l&gt;0$ and recursive sequence$\{h_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with $h_1=1$, $h_{n+1}=c_1h_n+c_2h_{n-1}+...+c_nh_1+1$ $(1\le n&lt; l)$ and$h_{n+1}=c_1h_n+c_2h_{n-1}+...+c_lh_{n+1-l}$ $(n\geq l)$, every positiveinteger can be written uniquely as $\sum a_ih_i$ under natural constraints onthe $a_i$'s, the mean and the variance of the numbers of summands for integersin $[h_{n}, h_{n+1})$ are of size $n$, and the distribution of the numbers ofsummands converges to a gaussian as $n$ goes to the infinity. previousapproaches used number theory or ergodic theory. we convert the problem to acombinatorial one. in addition to re-deriving these results, our methodgeneralizes to a multitude of other problems (in the sequel paper \cite{bm} weshow how this perspective allows us to determine the distribution of gapsbetween summands in decompositions). for example, it is known that everyinteger can be written uniquely as a sum of the $\pm f_n$'s, such that everytwo terms of the same (opposite) sign differ in index by at least 4 (3). thepresence of negative summands introduces complications and features not seen inprevious problems. we prove that the distribution of the numbers of positiveand negative summands converges to a bivariate normal with computable, negativecorrelation, namely $-(21-2\phi)/(29+2\phi) \approx -0.551058$.

1011.0229	modeling convolutions of $l$-functions	a number of mathematical methods have been shown to model the zeroes of$l$-functions with remarkable success, including the ratios conjecture andrandom matrix theory. in order to understand the structure of convolutions offamilies of $l$-functions, we investigate how well these methods model thezeros of such functions. our primary focus is the convolution of the$l$-function associated to ramanujan's tau function with the family ofquadratic dirichlet $l$-functions, for which j.b. conrey and n.c. snaithcomputed the ratios conjecture's prediction. our main result is performing thenumber theory calculations and verifying these predictions for the one-leveldensity for suitably restricted test functions up to square-root error term.unlike random matrix theory, which only predicts the main term, the ratiosconjecture detects the arithmetic of the family and makes detailed predictionsabout their dependence in the lower order terms. interestingly, while randommatrix theory is frequently used to model behavior of l-functions (or at leastthe main terms), there has been little if any work on the analogue ofconvolving families of l-functions by convolving random matrix ensembles. weexplore one possibility by considering kronecker products; unfortunately, itappears that this is not the correct random matrix analogue to convolvingfamilies.

1107.4426	a random matrix model for elliptic curve l-functions of finite conductor	we propose a random matrix model for families of elliptic curve l-functionsof finite conductor. a repulsion of the critical zeros of these l-functionsaway from the center of the critical strip was observed numerically by s. j.miller in 2006; such behaviour deviates qualitatively from the conjecturallimiting distribution of the zeros (for large conductors this distribution isexpected to approach the one-level density of eigenvalues of orthogonalmatrices after appropriate rescaling).our purpose here is to provide a randommatrix model for miller's surprising discovery. we consider the family of evenquadratic twists of a given elliptic curve. the main ingredient in our model isa calculation of the eigenvalue distribution of random orthogonal matriceswhose characteristic polynomials are larger than some given value at thesymmetry point in the spectra. we call this sub-ensemble of so(2n) the excisedorthogonal ensemble. the sieving-off of matrices with small values of thecharacteristic polynomial is akin to the discretization of the central valuesof l-functions implied by the formula of waldspurger and kohnen-zagier.thecut-off scale appropriate to modeling elliptic curve l-functions isexponentially small relative to the matrix size n. the one-level density of theexcised ensemble can be expressed in terms of that of the well-known jacobiensemble, enabling the former to be explicitly calculated. it exhibits anexponentially small (on the scale of the mean spacing) hard gap determined bythe cut-off value, followed by soft repulsion on a much larger scale. neitherof these features is present in the one-level density of so(2n). when n tendsto infinity we recover the limiting orthogonal behaviour. our results agreequalitatively with miller's discrepancy. choosing the cut-off appropriatelygives a model in good quantitative agreement with the number-theoretical data.

1111.6524	low-lying zeros of cuspidal maass forms	the katz-sarnak density conjecture states that the behavior of zeros of afamily of $l$-functions near the central point (as the conductors tend to zero)agree with the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 of a classical compact group (asthe matrix size tends to infinity). using the petersson formula, iwaniec, luoand sarnak \cite{ils} proved that the behavior of zeros near the central pointof holomorphic cusp forms agree with the behavior of eigenvalues of orthogonalmatrices for suitably restricted test functions. we prove a similar result forlevel 1 cuspidal maass forms, the other natural family of ${\rm gl}_2$$l$-functions. we use the explicit formula to relate sums of our test functionat scaled zeros to sums of the fourier transform at the primes weighted by the$l$-function coefficients, and then use the kuznetsov trace formula to averagethe fourier coefficients over the family. there are numerous technicalobstructions in handling the terms in the trace formula, which are surmountedthrough the use of smooth weight functions for the maass eigenvalues andresults on kloosterman sums and bessel and hyperbolic functions.

1112.3719	distribution of eigenvalues of weighted, structured matrix ensembles	the limiting distribution of eigenvalues of n x n random matrices has manyapplications. one of the most studied ensembles are real symmetric matriceswith independent entries iidrv; the limiting rescaled spectral measure (lrsm)$\widetilde{\mu}$ is the semi-circle. studies have determined the lrsms formany structured ensembles, such as toeplitz and circulant matrices. these havevery different behavior; the lrsm for both have unbounded support. given astructured ensemble such that (i) each random variable occurs o(n) times ineach row and (ii) the lrsm exists, we introduce a parameter to continuouslyinterpolate between these behaviors. we fix a p in [1/2, 1] and study theensemble of signed structured matrices by multiplying the (i,j)-th and (j,i)-thentries of a matrix by a randomly chosen epsilon_ij in {1, -1}, withprob(epsilon_ij = 1) = p (i.e., the hadamard product). for p = 1/2 we provethat the limiting signed rescaled spectral measure is the semi-circle. for allother p, the limiting measure has bounded (resp., unbounded) support if$\widetilde{\mu}$ has bounded (resp., unbounded) support, and converges to$\widetilde{\mu}$ as p -&gt; 1. notably, these results hold for toeplitz andcirculant matrix ensembles.  the proofs are by the method of moments. the analysis involves the pairingsof 2k vertices on a circle. the contribution of each in the signed case isweighted by a factor depending on p and the number of vertices involved in atleast one crossing. these numbers appear in combinatorics and knot theory. thenumber of configurations with no vertices involved in a crossing iswell-studied, and are the catalan numbers. we prove similar formulas forconfigurations with up to 10 vertices in at least one crossing. we derive aclosed-form expression for the expected value and determine the asymptotics forthe variance for the number of vertices in at least one crossing.

1208.5820	the average gap distribution for generalized zeckendorf decompositions	an interesting characterization of the fibonacci numbers is that, if we writethem as $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 2$, $f_3 = 3$, $f_4 = 5, ...$, then every positiveinteger can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent fibonacci numbers.this is now known as zeckendorf's theorem [21], and similar decompositionsexist for many other sequences ${g_{n+1} = c_1 g_{n} + ... + c_l g_{n+1-l}}$arising from recurrence relations. much more is known. using continued fractionapproaches, lekkerkerker [15] proved the average number of summands needed forintegers in $[g_n, g_{n+1})$ is on the order of $c_{{\rm lek}} n$ for anon-zero constant; this was improved by others to show the number of summandshas gaussian fluctuations about this mean.  kolo$\breve{{\rm g}}$lu, kopp, miller and wang [17, 18] recently recast theproblem combinatorially, reproving and generalizing these results. we use thisnew perspective to investigate the distribution of gaps between summands. weexplore the average behavior over all $m \in [g_n, g_{n+1})$ for specialchoices of the $c_i$'s. specifically, we study the case where each $c_i \in{0,1}$ and there is a $g$ such that there are always exactly $g-1$ zerosbetween two non-zero $c_i$'s; note this includes the fibonacci, tribonacci andmany other important special cases. we prove there are no gaps of length lessthan $g$, and the probability of a gap of length $j &gt; g$ decays geometrically,with the decay ratio equal to the largest root of the recurrence relation.these methods are combinatorial and apply to related problems; we end with adiscussion of similar results for far-difference (i.e., signed) decompositions.

1212.2930	coordinate sum and difference sets of $d$-dimensional modular hyperbolas	many problems in additive number theory, such as fermat's last theorem andthe twin prime conjecture, can be understood by examining sums or differencesof a set with itself. a finite set $a \subset \mathbb{z}$ is consideredsum-dominant if $|a+a|&gt;|a-a|$. if we consider all subsets of ${0, 1, ...,n-1}$, as $n\to\infty$ it is natural to expect that almost all subsets shouldbe difference-dominant, as addition is commutative but subtraction is not;however, martin and o'bryant in 2007 proved that a positive percentage aresum-dominant as $n\to\infty$.  this motivates the study of "coordinate sum dominance". given $v \subset(\z/n\z)^2$, we call $s:={x+y: (x,y) \in v}$ a coordinate sumset and $d:=\{x-y:(x,y) \in v\}$ a coordinate difference set, and we say $v$ is coordinate sumdominant if $|s|&gt;|d|$. an arithmetically interesting choice of $v$ is$\bar{h}_2(a;n)$, which is the reduction modulo $n$ of the modular hyperbola$h_2(a;n) := {(x,y): xy \equiv a \bmod n, 1 \le x,y &lt; n}$. in 2009, eichhorn,khan, stein, and yankov determined the sizes of $s$ and $d$ for$v=\bar{h}_2(1;n)$ and investigated conditions for coordinate sum dominance. weextend their results to reduced $d$-dimensional modular hyperbolas$\bar{h}_d(a;n)$ with $a$ coprime to $n$.

1301.5702	low-lying zeroes of maass form $l$-functions	the katz-sarnak density conjecture states that the scaling limits of thedistributions of zeros of families of automorphic $l$-functions agree with thescaling limits of eigenvalue distributions of classical subgroups of theunitary groups $u(n)$. this conjecture is often tested by way of computingparticular statistics, such as the one-level density, which evaluates a testfunction with compactly supported fourier transform at normalized zeros nearthe central point. iwaniec, luo, and sarnak studied the one-level densities ofcuspidal newforms of weight $k$ and level $n$. they showed in the limit as $kn\to\infty$ that these families have one-level densities agreeing withorthogonal type for test functions with fourier transform supported in$(-2,2)$. exceeding $(-1,1)$ is important as the three orthogonal groups areindistinguishable for support up to $(-1,1)$ but are distinguishable for anylarger support. we study the other family of ${\rm gl}_2$ automorphic formsover $\mathbb{q}$: maass forms. to facilitate the analysis, we use smoothweight functions in the kuznetsov formula which, among other restrictions,vanish to order $m$ at the origin. for test functions with fourier transformsupported inside $\left(-2 + \frac{2}{2m+1}, 2 - \frac{2}{2m+1}\right)$, weunconditionally prove the one-level density of the low-lying zeros of level 1maass forms, as the eigenvalues tend to infinity, agrees only with that of thescaling limit of orthogonal matrices.

1301.5703	when generalized sumsets are difference dominated	we study the relationship between the number of minus signs in a generalizedsumset, $a+...+a-...-a$, and its cardinality; without loss of generality we mayassume there are at least as many positive signs as negative signs. as additionis commutative and subtraction is not, we expect that for most $a$ acombination with more minus signs has more elements than one with fewer;however, recently iyer, lazarev, miller and zhang proved that a positivepercentage of the time the combination with fewer minus signs can have moreelements. their analysis involves choosing sets $a$ uniformly at random from${0,...,n}$; this is equivalent to independently choosing each element of${0,...,n}$ to be in $a$ with probability 1/2. we investigate what happens wheninstead each element is chosen with probability $p(n)$, with $\lim_{n\to\infty}p(n) =0$. we prove that the set with more minus signs is larger withprobability 1 as $n\to\infty$ if $p(n)=cn^{-\delta}$ for$\delta\ge\frac{h-1}{h}$, where $h$ is the number of total summands in$a+...+a-...-a$, and explicitly quantify their relative sizes. the resultsgeneralize earlier work of hegarty and miller, and we see a phase transition inthe behavior of the cardinalities when $\delta = \frac{h-1}{h}$.

1306.6714	on the spectral distribution of large weighted random regular graphs	mckay proved that the limiting spectral measures of the ensembles of$d$-regular graphs with $n$ vertices converge to kesten's measure as$n\to\infty$. in this paper we explore the case of weighted graphs. moreprecisely, given a large $d$-regular graph we assign random weights, drawn fromsome distribution $\mathcal{w}$, to its edges. we study the relationshipbetween $\mathcal{w}$ and the associated limiting spectral distributionobtained by averaging over the weighted graphs. among other results, weestablish the existence of a unique `eigendistribution', i.e., a weightdistribution $\mathcal{w}$ such that the associated limiting spectraldistribution is a rescaling of $\mathcal{w}$. initial investigations suggestedthat the eigendistribution was the semi-circle distribution, which by wigner'slaw is the limiting spectral measure for real symmetric matrices. we prove thisis not the case, though the deviation between the eigendistribution and thesemi-circular density is small (the first seven moments agree, and thedifference in each higher moment is $o(1/d^2)$). our analysis usescombinatorial results about closed acyclic walks in large trees, which may beof independent interest.

1308.2344	most subsets are balanced in finite groups	the sumset is one of the most basic and central objects in additive numbertheory. many of the most important problems (such as goldbach's conjecture andfermat's last theorem) can be formulated in terms of the sumset $s + s = \{x+y: x,y\in s\}$ of a set of integers $s$. a finite set of integers $a$ issum-dominated if $|a+a| &gt; |a-a|$. though it was believed that the percentage ofsubsets of $\{0,...,n\}$ that are sum-dominated tends to zero, in 2006 martinand o'bryant proved a very small positive percentage are sum-dominated if thesets are chosen uniformly at random (through work of zhao we know thispercentage is approximately $4.5 \cdot 10^{-4}$). while most sets aredifference-dominated in the integer case, this is not the case when we takesubsets of many finite groups. we show that if we take subsets of larger andlarger finite groups uniformly at random, then not only does the probability ofa set being sum-dominated tend to zero but the probability that $|a+a|=|a-a|$tends to one, and hence a typical set is balanced in this case. the cause ofthis marked difference in behavior is that subsets of $\{0,..., n\}$ have afringe, whereas finite groups do not. we end with a detailed analysis ofdihedral groups, where the results are in striking contrast to what occurs forsubsets of integers.

1309.5599	generalizing zeckendorf's theorem to f-decompositions	a beautiful theorem of zeckendorf states that every positive integer can beuniquely decomposed as a sum of non-consecutive fibonacci numbers $\{f_n\}$,where $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 2$ and $f_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1}$. for generalrecurrences $\{g_n\}$ with non-negative coefficients, there is a notion of alegal decomposition which again leads to a unique representation, and thenumber of summands in the representations of uniformly randomly chosen $m \in[g_n, g_{n+1})$ converges to a normal distribution as $n \to \infty$.  we consider the converse question: given a notion of legal decomposition, isit possible to construct a sequence $\{a_n\}$ such that every positive integercan be decomposed as a sum of terms from the sequence? we encode a notion oflegal decomposition as a function $f:\n_0\to\n_0$ and say that if $a_n$ is inan "$f$-decomposition", then the decomposition cannot contain the $f(n)$ termsimmediately before $a_n$ in the sequence; special choices of $f$ yield manywell known decompositions (including base-$b$, zeckendorf and factorial). weprove that for any $f:\n_0\to\n_0$, there exists a sequence$\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ such that every positive integer has a unique$f$-decomposition using $\{a_n\}$. further, if $f$ is periodic, then the uniqueincreasing sequence $\{a_n\}$ that corresponds to $f$ satisfies a linearrecurrence relation. previous research only handled recurrence relations withno negative coefficients. we find a function $f$ that yields a sequence thatcannot be described by such a recurrence relation. finally, for a class offunctions $f$, we prove that the number of summands in the $f$-decomposition ofintegers between two consecutive terms of the sequence converges to a normaldistribution.

1309.5600	a generalization of fibonacci far-difference representations and  gaussian behavior	a natural generalization of base b expansions is zeckendorf's theorem: everyinteger can be uniquely written as a sum of non-consecutive fibonacci numbers$\{f_n\}$, with $f_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1}$ and $f_1=1, f_2=2$. if instead weallow the coefficients of the fibonacci numbers in the decomposition to be zeroor $\pm 1$, the resulting expression is known as the far-differencerepresentation. alpert proved that a far-difference representation exists andis unique under certain restraints that generalize non-consecutiveness,specifically that two adjacent summands of the same sign must be at least 4indices apart and those of opposite signs must be at least 3 indices apart. weprove that a far-difference representation can be created using sets ofskipponacci numbers, which are generated by recurrence relations of the form$s^{(k)}_{n+1} = s^{(k)}_{n} + s^{(k)}_{n-k}$ for $k \ge 0$. every integer canbe written uniquely as a sum of the $\pm s^{(k)}_n $'s such that every twoterms of the same sign differ in index by at least 2k+2, and every two terms ofopposite signs differ in index by at least k+2. additionally, we prove that thenumber of positive and negative terms in given skipponacci decompositionsconverges to a gaussian, with a computable correlation coefficient that is arational function of the smallest root of the characteristic polynomial of therecurrence. the proof uses recursion to obtain the generating function forhaving a fixed number of summands, which we prove converges to the generatingfunction of a gaussian. we next explore the distribution of gaps betweensummands, and show that for any k the probability of finding a gap of length $j\ge 2k+2$ decays geometrically, with decay ratio equal to the largest root ofthe given k-skipponacci recurrence. we conclude by finding sequences that havean (s,d) far-difference representation for any positive integers s,d.

1401.2588	sums and differences of correlated random sets	many fundamental questions in additive number theory (such as goldbach'sconjecture, fermat's last theorem, and the twin primes conjecture) can beexpressed in the language of sum and difference sets. as a typical pair ofelements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect that $|a-a| &gt;|a+a|$ for a finite set $a$. however, in 2006 martin and o'bryant showed that apositive proportion of subsets of $\{0, \dots, n\}$ are sum-dominant, and zhaolater showed that this proportion converges to a positive limit as $n \to\infty$. related problems, such as constructing explicit families ofsum-dominant sets, computing the value of the limiting proportion, andinvestigating the behavior as the probability of including a given element in$a$ to go to zero, have been analyzed extensively.  we consider many of these problems in a more general setting. instead of justone set $a$, we study sums and differences of pairs of \emph{correlated} sets$(a,b)$. specifically, we place each element $a \in \{0,\dots, n\}$ in $a$ withprobability $p$, while $a$ goes in $b$ with probability $\rho_1$ if $a \in a$and probability $\rho_2$ if $a \not \in a$. if $|a+b| &gt; |(a-b) \cup (b-a)|$, wecall the pair $(a,b)$ a \emph{sum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair}. we provethat for any fixed $\vec{\rho}=(p, \rho_1, \rho_2)$ in $(0,1)^3$, $(a,b)$ is asum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair with positive probability, and show thatthis probability approaches a limit $p(\vec{\rho})$. furthermore, we show thatthe limit function $p(\vec{\rho})$ is continuous. we also investigate whathappens as $p$ decays with $n$, generalizing results of hegarty-miller on phasetransitions. finally, we find the smallest sizes of mstd pairs.

1409.0483	gaussian behavior of the number of summands in zeckendorf decompositions  in small intervals	zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be writtenuniquely as a sum of non-consecutive fibonacci numbers ${f_n}$, with initialterms $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 2$. we consider the distribution of the number ofsummands involved in such decompositions. previous work proved that as $n \to\infty$ the distribution of the number of summands in the zeckendorfdecompositions of $m \in [f_n, f_{n+1})$, appropriately normalized, convergesto the standard normal. the proofs crucially used the fact that all integers in$[f_n, f_{n+1})$ share the same potential summands.  we generalize these results to subintervals of $[f_n, f_{n+1})$ as $n \to\infty$; the analysis is significantly more involved here as different integershave different sets of potential summands. explicitly, fix an integer sequence$\alpha(n) \to \infty$. as $n \to \infty$, for almost all $m \in [f_n,f_{n+1})$ the distribution of the number of summands in the zeckendorfdecompositions of integers in the subintervals $[m, m + f_{\alpha(n)})$,appropriately normalized, converges to the standard normal. the proof followsby showing that, with probability tending to $1$, $m$ has at least oneappropriately located large gap between indices in its decomposition. we thenuse a correspondence between this interval and $[0, f_{\alpha(n)})$ to obtainthe result, since the summands are known to have gaussian behavior in thelatter interval. % we also prove the same result for more general linearrecurrences.

1411.2071	newman's conjecture, zeros of the l-functions, function fields	de bruijn and newman introduced a deformation of the completed riemann zetafunction $\zeta$, and proved there is a real constant $\lambda$ which encodesthe movement of the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta$ under the deformation. theriemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that $\lambda\leq 0$. newman,however, conjectured that $\lambda\geq 0$, remarking, "the new conjecture is aquantitative version of the dictum that the riemann hypothesis, if true, isonly barely so." andrade, chang and miller extended the machinery developed bynewman and polya to $l$-functions for function fields. in this setting we mustconsider a modified newman's conjecture: $\sup_{f\in\mathcal{f}} \lambda_f \geq0$, for $\mathcal{f}$ a family of $l$-functions.  we extend their results by proving this modified newman's conjecture forseveral families of $l$-functions. in contrast with previous work, we are ableto exhibit specific $l$-functions for which $\lambda_d = 0$, and thereby provea stronger statement: $\max_{l\in\mathcal{f}} \lambda_l = 0$. using geometrictechniques, we show a certain deformed $l$-function must have a double root,which implies $\lambda = 0$. for a different family, we construct particularelliptic curves with $p + 1$ points over $\mathbb{f}_p$. by the weilconjectures, this has either the maximum or minimum possible number of pointsover $\mathbb{f}_{p^{2n}}$. the fact that $#e(\mathbb{f}_{p^{2n}})$ attains thebound tells us that the associated $l$-function satisfies $\lambda = 0$.

1411.3442	limiting spectral measures for random matrix ensembles with a polynomial  link function	consider the ensembles of real symmetric toeplitz matrices and real symmetrichankel matrices whose entries are i.i.d. random variables chosen from a fixedprobability distribution p of mean 0, variance 1, and finite higher moments.previous work on real symmetric toeplitz matrices shows that the spectralmeasures, or densities of normalized eigenvalues, converge almost surely to auniversal near-gaussian distribution, while previous work on real symmetrichankel matrices shows that the spectral measures converge almost surely to auniversal non-unimodal distribution. real symmetric toeplitz matrices areconstant along the diagonals, while real symmetric hankel matrices are constantalong the skew diagonals. we generalize the toeplitz and hankel matrices tostudy matrices that are constant along some curve described by a real-valuedbivariate polynomial. using the method of moments and an analysis of theresulting diophantine equations, we show that the spectral measures associatedwith linear bivariate polynomials converge in probability and almost surely touniversal non-semicircular distributions. we prove that these limitingdistributions approach the semicircle in the limit of large values of thepolynomial coefficients. we then prove that the spectral measures associatedwith the sum or difference of any two real-valued polynomials with differentdegrees converge in probability and almost surely to a universal semicirculardistribution.

1412.0999	geometric-progression-free sets over quadratic number fields	a problem of recent interest has been to study how large subsets of thenatural numbers can be while avoiding 3-term geometric progressions. buildingon recent progress on this problem, we consider the analogous problem overquadratic number fields. we first construct high-density subsets of thealgebraic integers of an imaginary quadratic number field that avoid 3-termgeometric progressions. when unique factorization fails or over a realquadratic number field, we instead look at subsets of ideals of the ring ofintegers. our approach here is to construct sets "greedily," a generalizationof the greedy set of rational integers considered by rankin. we then describethe densities of these sets in terms of values of the dedekind zeta function.next, we consider geometric-progression-free sets with large upper density. wegeneralize an argument by riddell to obtain upper bounds for the upper densityof geometric-progression-free subsets, and construct sets avoiding geometricprogressions with high upper density to obtain lower bounds for the supremum ofthe upper density of all such subsets. both arguments depend critically on theelements with small norm in the ring of integers.

1412.6839	benford behavior of generalized zeckendorf decompositions	we prove connections between zeckendorf decompositions and benford's law.recall that if we define the fibonacci numbers by $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 2$ and$f_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1}$, every positive integer can be written uniquely as asum of non-adjacent elements of this sequence; this is called the zeckendorfdecomposition, and similar unique decompositions exist for sequences arisingfrom recurrence relations of the form $g_{n+1}=c_1g_n+\cdots+c_lg_{n+1-l}$ with$c_i$ positive and some other restrictions. additionally, a set $s \subset\mathbb{z}$ is said to satisfy benford's law base 10 if the density of theelements in $s$ with leading digit $d$ is $\log_{10}{(1+\frac{1}{d})}$; inother words, smaller leading digits are more likely to occur. we prove that as$n\to\infty$ for a randomly selected integer $m$ in $[0, g_{n+1})$ thedistribution of the leading digits of the summands in its generalizedzeckendorf decomposition converges to benford's law almost surely. our resultshold more generally: one obtains similar theorems to those regarding thedistribution of leading digits when considering how often values in sets withdensity are attained in the summands in the decompositions.

1505.07481	from quantum systems to l-functions: pair correlation statistics and  beyond	the discovery of connections between the distribution of energy levels ofheavy nuclei and spacings between prime numbers has been one of the mostsurprising and fruitful observations in the twentieth century. the connectionbetween the two areas was first observed through montgomery's work on the paircorrelation of zeros of the riemann zeta function. as its generalizations andconsequences have motivated much of the following work, and to this day remainsone of the most important outstanding conjectures in the field, it occupies acentral role in our discussion below. we describe some of the many techniquesand results from the past sixty years, especially the important roles played bynumerical and experimental investigations, that led to the discovery of theconnections and progress towards understanding the behaviors. in our survey ofthese two areas, we describe the common mathematics that explains theremarkable universality. we conclude with some thoughts on what might lie aheadin the pair correlation of zeros of the zeta function, and other similarquantities.

1507.03597	the emergence of 4-cycles in polynomial maps over the extended integers	let $f(x) \in \mathbb{z}[x]$; for each integer $\alpha$ it is interesting toconsider the number of iterates $n_{\alpha}$, if possible, needed to satisfy$f^{n_{\alpha}}(\alpha) = \alpha$. the sets $\{\alpha, f(\alpha), \ldots,f^{n_{\alpha} - 1}(\alpha), \alpha\}$ generated by the iterates of $f$ arecalled cycles. for $\mathbb{z}[x]$ it is known that cycles of length 1 and 2occur, and no others. while much is known for extensions to number fields, weconcentrate on extending $\mathbb{z}$ by adjoining reciprocals of primes. let$\mathbb{z}[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n]$ denote $\mathbb{z}$ extended by adding inthe reciprocals of the $n$ primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ and all their products andpowers with each other and the elements of $\mathbb{z}$.  interestingly, cycles of length 4, called 4-cycles, emerge for polynomials in$\mathbb{z}\left[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n\right][x]$ under the appropriateconditions. the problem of finding criteria under which 4-cycles emerge isequivalent to determining how often a sum of four terms is zero, where theterms are $\pm 1$ times a product of elements from the list of $n$ primes. weinvestigate conditions on sets of primes under which 4-cycles emerge. wecharacterize when 4-cycles emerge if the set has one or two primes, and(assuming a generalization of the abc conjecture) find conditions on sets ofprimes guaranteed not to cause 4-cycles to emerge.

1508.02907	ramsey theory problems over the integers: avoiding generalized  progressions	two well studied ramsey-theoretic problems consider subsets of the naturalnumbers which either contain no three elements in arithmetic progression, or ingeometric progression. we study generalizations of this problem, by varying thekinds of progressions to be avoided and the metrics used to evaluate thedensity of the resulting subsets. one can view a 3-term arithmetic progressionas a sequence $x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x))$, where $f_n(x) = x + n$, $n$ a nonzerointeger. thus avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions is equivalent tocontaining no three elements of the form $x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x))$ with $f_n\in\mathcal{f}_{\rm t}$, the set of integer translations. one can similarlyconstruct related progressions using different families of functions. weinvestigate several such families, including geometric progressions ($f_n(x) =nx$ with $n &gt; 1$ a natural number) and exponential progressions ($f_n(x) =x^n$).  progression-free sets are often constructed "greedily," including everynumber so long as it is not in progression with any of the previous elements.rankin characterized the greedy geometric-progression-free set in terms of thegreedy arithmetic set. we characterize the greedy exponential set and provethat it has asymptotic density 1, and then discuss how the optimality of thegreedy set depends on the family of functions used to define progressions.traditionally, the size of a progression-free set is measured using the (upper)asymptotic density, however we consider several different notions of density,including the uniform and exponential densities.

0805.4208	an orthogonal test of the l-functions ratios conjecture	we test the predictions of the l-functions ratios conjecture for the familyof cuspidal newforms of weight k and level n, with either k fixed and n --&gt; oothrough the primes or n=1 and k --&gt; oo. we study the main and lower order termsin the 1-level density. we provide evidence for the ratios conjecture bycomputing and confirming its predictions up to a power savings in the family'scardinality, at least for test functions whose fourier transforms are supportedin (-2, 2). we do this both for the weighted and unweighted 1-level density(where in the weighted case we use the petersson weights), thus showing thateither formulation may be used. these two 1-level densities differ by a term ofsize 1 / log(k^2 n). finally, we show that there is another way of extendingthe sums arising in the ratios conjecture, leading to a different answer(although the answer is such a lower order term that it is hopeless to observewhich is correct).

1508.06542	the m&amp;m game: from morsels to modern mathematics	to an adult, it's obvious that the day of someone's death is not preciselydetermined by the day of birth, but it's a very different story for a child.when the third named author was four years old he asked his father, the fifthnamed author: if two people are born on the same day, do they die on the sameday? while this could easily be demonstrated through murder, such a proof wouldgreatly diminish the possibility of teaching additional lessons, and thus adifferent approach was taken. with the help of the fourth named author theyinvented what we'll call \emph{the m\&amp;m game}: given $k$ people, eachsimultaneously flips a fair coin, with each eating an m\&amp;m on a head and noteating on a tail. the process then continues until all \mandms\ are consumed,and two people are deemed to die at the same time if they run out of \mandms\together\footnote{is one really living without \mandms?}. this led to a greatconcrete demonstration of randomness appropriate for little kids; it also ledto a host of math problems which have been used in probability classes and mathcompetitions. there are many ways to determine the probability of a tie, whichallow us in this article to use this problem as a springboard to a lot of greatmathematics, including memoryless process, combinatorics, statisticalinference, graph theory, and hypergeometric functions.

1508.07531	a generalization of zeckendorf's theorem via circumscribed $m$-gons	zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be uniquelydecomposed as a sum of nonconsecutive fibonacci numbers, where the fibonaccinumbers satisfy $f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$ for $n\geq 3$, $f_1=1$ and $f_2=2$. thedistribution of the number of summands in such decomposition converges to agaussian, the gaps between summands converges to geometric decay, and thedistribution of the longest gap is similar to that of the longest run of headsin a biased coin; these results also hold more generally, though for technicalreasons previous work needed to assume the coefficients in the recurrencerelation are non-negative and the first term is positive.  we extend these results by creating an infinite family of integer sequencescalled the $m$-gonal sequences arising from a geometric construction usingcircumscribed $m$-gons. they satisfy a recurrence where the first $m+1$ leadingterms vanish, and thus cannot be handled by existing techniques. we provide anotion of a legal decomposition, and prove that the decompositions exist andare unique. we then examine the distribution of the number of summands used inthe decompositions and prove that it displays gaussian behavior. there isgeometric decay in the distribution of gaps, both for gaps taken from allintegers in an interval and almost surely in distribution for the individualgap measures associated to each integer in the interval. we end by proving thatthe distribution of the longest gap between summands is strongly concentratedabout its mean, behaving similarly as in the longest run of heads in tosses ofa coin.

0704.0924	lower order terms in the 1-level density for families of holomorphic  cuspidal newforms	the katz-sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as theconductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the centralpoint of families of l-functions agree with the n -&gt; oo scaling limits ofeigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of u(n). evidence for this has been found formany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted testfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. in particular, allone-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over q(t) and the samedistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.we break this universality and find family dependent lower order correctionterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging fromexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, anddepend on the arithmetic of the family. we derive an alternate form of theexplicit formula for gl(2) l-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacingsums over powers of satake parameters by sums of the moments of the fouriercoefficients lambda_f(p). our formula highlights the differences that we expectto exist from families whose fourier coefficients obey different laws (forexample, we expect sato-tate to hold only for non-cm families of ellipticcurves). further, by the work of rosen and silverman we expect lower orderbiases to the fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rankover q(t); these biases can be seen in our expansions. we analyze severalfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forcedtorsion point, or non-zero rank over q(t).

0704.0927	a symplectic test of the l-functions ratios conjecture	recently conrey, farmer and zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averagesover a family of ratios of products of shifted l-functions. their l-functionsratios conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for manyproblems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers andmoments to vanishing at the central point. there are now many results showingagreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.these terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, andprovide a way to break the universality of behavior. the l-functions ratiosconjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. wetest a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplecticfamily of quadratic dirichlet characters arising from even fundamentaldiscriminants d \le x. for test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculateall the lower order terms up to size o(x^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfectagreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we showagreement up to errors of size o(x^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). thus for thisfamily and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the ratiosconjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.
