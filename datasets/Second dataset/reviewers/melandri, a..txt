0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1107.4096	gamma ray bursts in the comoving frame	we estimate the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 of 31 grbs using the measuredpeak time of their afterglow light curves. we consider two possible scenariosfor the estimate of gamma_0: the case of a homogeneous circumburst medium or awind density profile. the values of gamma_0 are broadly distributed between fewtens and several hundreds with average values ~138 and ~66 for the homogeneousand wind density profile, respectively. we find that the isotropic energy andluminosity correlate in a similar way with gamma_0, i.e. eiso gamma_0^2 andliso gamma_0^2, while the peak energy epeak gamma_0. these correlations areless scattered in the wind density profile than in the homogeneous case. wethen study the energetics, luminosities and spectral properties of our burstsin their comoving frame. the distribution of liso' is very narrow with adispersion of less than a decade in the wind case, clustering aroundliso'=5x10^48 erg/s. peak photon energies cluster around epeak'=6 kev. thenewly found correlations involving gamma_0 offer a general interpretationscheme for the spectral-energy correlations of grbs. the epeak-eiso andepeak-liso correlations are due to the different gamma_0 factors and thecollimation-corrected correlation, epeak-egamma (obtained by correcting theisotropic quantities for the jet opening angle theta_j), can be explained iftheta_j^2*gamma_0=constant. assuming the epeak-egamma correlation as valid, wefind a typical value of theta_j*gamma_0 ~ 6-20, in agreement with thepredictions of magnetically accelerated jet models.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.1700	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts: sample  presentation, luminosity function and evolution	we present a carefully selected sub-sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts(grbs), that is complete in redshift. the sample is constructed by consideringonly bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-upsearches, that are bright in the 15-150 kev swift/bat band, i.e. with 1-s peakphoton fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. the sample is composed by 58bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while anothertwo have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. for onlythree bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. the high level of redshiftcompleteness allows us for the first time to constrain the grb luminosityfunction and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. we find thatstrong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)is required in order to account for the observations. the derived redshiftdistribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite oftheir different intrinsic redshift distribution. this calls for otherindicators to distinguish among different evolution models. complete samplesare at the base of any population studies. in future works we will use thisunique sample of swift bright grbs to study the properties of the population oflong grbs.

1112.4480	the dark bursts population in a complete sample of bright swift long  gamma-ray bursts	we study the properties of the population of optically dark events present ina carefully selected complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts. thehigh level of completeness in redshift of our sample (52 objects out of 58)allow us to establish the existence of a genuine dark population and we areable to estimate the maximum fraction of dark burst events (~30%) expected forthe whole class of long gamma-ray burst. the redshift distribution of thispopulation of dark bursts is similar to the one of the whole sample.interestingly, the rest-frame x-ray luminosity (and the de-absorbed x-ray flux)of the sub-class of dark bursts is slightly higher than the average luminosityof the non-dark events. at the same time the prompt properties do not differand the optical flux of dark events is at the lower tail of the optical fluxdistribution, corrected for galactic absorption. all these properties suggestthat dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect tonormal bright events. we can therefore exclude the high-z and the low-densityscenarios and conclude that the major cause of the origin of optically darkevents is the dust extinction.

1112.5111	the x-ray absorbing column density of a complete sample of bright swift  gamma-ray bursts	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has been recentlyselected by salvaterra et al.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1210.1215	the faster the narrower: characteristic bulk velocities and jet opening  angles of gamma ray bursts	the jet opening angle theta_jet and the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 arecrucial parameters for the computation of the energetics of gamma ray bursts(grbs). from the ~30 grbs with measured theta_jet or gamma_0 it is known that:(i) the real energetic e_gamma, obtained by correcting the isotropic equivalentenergy e_iso for the collimation factor ~theta_jet^2, is clustered around10^50-10^51 erg and it is correlated with the peak energy e_p of the promptemission and (ii) the comoving frame e'_p and e'_gamma are clustered aroundtypical values. current estimates of gamma_0 and theta_jet are based onincomplete data samples and their observed distributions could be subject tobiases. through a population synthesis code we investigate whether differentassumed intrinsic distributions of gamma_0 and theta_jet can reproduce a set ofobservational constraints. assuming that all bursts have the same e'_p ande'_gamma in the comoving frame, we find that gamma_0 and theta_jet cannot bedistributed as single power-laws. the best agreement between our simulation andthe available data is obtained assuming (a) log-normal distributions fortheta_jet and gamma_0 and (b) an intrinsic relation between the peak values oftheir distributions, i.e theta_jet^2.5*gamma_0=const. on average, larger valuesof gamma_0 (i.e. the "faster" bursts) correspond to smaller values of theta_jet(i.e. the "narrower"). we predict that ~6% of the bursts that point to usshould not show any jet break in their afterglow light curve since they havesin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma_0. finally, we estimate that the local rate of grbs is~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~4.3% of local hypernovae, i.e. snib/c withbroad-lines.

1211.2062	grbs have preferred jet opening angles and bulk lorentz factors	we recently found that gamma ray burst energies and luminosities, in theircomoving frame, are remarkably similar. this, coupled with the clustering ofenergetics once corrected for the collimation factor, suggests the possibilitythat all bursts, in their comoving frame, have the same peak energy e'peak (ofthe order of a few kev) and the same energetics of the prompt emission e'gamma(of the order of 2e48 erg). the large diversity of bursts energies is then dueto the different bulk lorentz factor gamma and jet aperture angle theta_jet. weinvestigated, through a population synthesis code, what are the distributionsof gamma and theta_jet compatible with the observations. both quantities musthave preferred values, with log-normal best fitting distributions and &lt;gamma0&gt;~ 275 and &lt;\theta_jet&gt; ~ 8.7 degree. moreover, the peak values of the gamma andtheta_jet distributions must be related - theta_jet^2.5 gamma =const: thenarrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk lorentz factor. we predict that ~6%of the bursts that point to us should not show any jet break in their afterglowlight curve since they have sin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma. finally, we estimate thatthe local rate of grbs is ~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~2.5% of localhypernovae, i.e. snib/c with broad absorption lines.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1305.1928	evidence for dust destruction from the early-time colour change of grb  120119a	we present broadband observations and analysis of swift gamma-ray burst (grb)120119a. our early-time afterglow detections began under 15 s after the burstin the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and they yield constraints on the burstenergetics and local environment. late-time afterglow observations of the burstshow evidence for a moderate column of dust (a_v ~ 1.1 mag) similar to, butstatistically distinct from, dust seen along small magellanic cloud sightlines.deep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly star-forming host galaxy.most notably, our early-time observations exhibit a significant red-to-bluecolour change in the first ~200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseenin grb afterglows. this colour change, which is coincident with the finalphases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark prediction of the photodestructionof dust in grb afterglows. we test whether dust-destruction signatures aresignificantly distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change inthe intrinsic spectral index {\beta}. we find that a time-varying power-lawspectrum alone cannot adequately describe the observed colour change, andallowing for dust destruction (via a time-varying a_v) significantly improvesthe fit. while not definitively ruling out other possibilities, this eventprovides the best support yet for the direct detection of dust destruction inthe local environment of a grb.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1307.7704	radio afterglows of a complete sample of bright swift grbs: predictions  from present days to the ska era	radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental inproviding insights into their physics and environment, and in constraining thetrue energetics of these sources. nonetheless, radio observations of grbafterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. starting from acomplete sample of 58 bright swift long bursts (bat6), we constructed ahomogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves allthe properties of the parent sample. one half of the bursts have detectionsbetween 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes f&gt;100 mujy at 8.4ghz. through a population synthesis code coupled with the standard afterglowhydrodynamical emission model (psyche) we reproduce the radio flux distributionof the radio sub-sample. based on these results we study the detectability inthe time/frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present andfuture radio facilities. we find that the grbs that typically trigger swift canbe detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even athigh redshifts. the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb populationprovided that there will be a dedicated grb gamma-ray detector more sensitivethan swift. for a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, ska will allow us toperform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring~100 d), providing an estimate of the true (collimation corrected) energeticsof grbs.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1309.1167	the obscured hyper-energetic grb 120624b hosted by a luminous compact  galaxy at z = 2.20	gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous explosions that we can witness in theuniverse. studying the most extreme cases of these phenomena allows us toconstrain the limits for the progenitor models. in this letter, we study theprompt emission, afterglow, and host galaxy of grb 120624b, one of thebrightest grbs detected by fermi, to derive the energetics of the event andcharacterise the host galaxy in which it was produced. following thehigh-energy detection we conducted a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign,including near-infrared imaging from hawki/vlt, optical from osiris/gtc, x-rayobservations from the chandra x-ray observatory and atsub-millimetre/millimetre wavelengths from sma. optical/nir spectroscopy wasperformed with x-shooter/vlt. we detect the x-ray and nir afterglow of theburst and determine a redshift of z = 2.1974 +/- 0.0002 through theidentification of emission lines of [oii], [oiii] and h-alpha from the hostgalaxy of the grb. this implies an energy release of eiso = (3.0+/-0.2)x10^54erg, amongst the most luminous ever detected. the observations of the afterglowindicate high obscuration with av &gt; 1.5. the host galaxy is compact, with r1/2&lt; 1.6 kpc, but luminous, at l ~ 1.5 l* and has a star formation rate of 91 +/-6 msol/yr as derived from h-alpha. as other highly obscured grbs, grb 120624bis hosted by a luminous galaxy, which we also proof to be compact, with a veryintense star formation. it is one of the most luminous host galaxies associatedwith a grb, showing that the host galaxies of long grbs are not always bluedwarf galaxies, as previously thought.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1402.6338	grb orphan afterglows in present and future radio transient surveys	orphan afterglows (oa) are slow transients produced by gamma ray bursts seenoff-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/nir andradio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (x and gamma rays)has already ceased. given the typically estimated jet opening angle of grbstheta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the earth there should be afactor ~ 700 more grbs pointing in other directions. despite this, no secureoas have been detected so far. through a population synthesis code we study theemission properties of the population of oa at radio frequencies. oas reachtheir emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount oftime. the typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are offew micro jy in the radio band with only a few oa reaching the mjy level. thesevalues are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of sn ib/cobserved at late times. we find that the oa radio number count distribution hasa typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxeswith a break at a frequency-dependent flux. our predictions of the oa rates areconsistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searchesfor radio transients. future radio surveys like vast/askap at 1.4 ghz shoulddetect ~ 3x10^-3 oa deg^-2 yr-1, meerkat and evla at 8.4 ghz should see ~3x10^-1 oa deg-2 yr-1. the ska, reaching the micro jy flux limit, could see upto ~ 0.2-1.5 oa deg^-2 yr^-1. these rates also depend on the duration of the oaabove a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to thesurvey cadence.

1408.4121	grb 140206a: the most distant polarized gamma-ray burst	the nature of the prompt gamma-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) isstill far from being completely elucidated. the measure of linear polarizationis a powerful tool that can be used to put further constraints on the contentand magnetization of the grb relativistic outflows, as well as on the radiationprocesses at work.  to date only a handful of polarization measurements are available for theprompt emission of grbs. here we present the analysis of the prompt emission ofgrb 140206a, obtained with integral/ibis, swift/bat, and fermi/gbm. usingintegral/ibis as a compton polarimeter we were able to constrain the linearpolarization level of the second peak of this grb as being larger than 28% at90% c.l.  we also present the grb afterglow optical spectroscopy obtained at thetelescopio nazionale galileo (tng), which allowed us the measure the distanceof this grb, z=2.739. this distance value together with the polarizationmeasure obtained with ibis, allowed us to derive the deepest and most reliablelimit to date (xi &lt;1x10-16) on the possibility of lorentz invariance violation,measured through the vacuum birefringence effect on a cosmological source.

1409.6467	the nature of the late achromatic bump in grb 120326a	the long ${\it swift}$ gamma-ray burst grb 120326a at redshift $z=1.798$exhibited a multi-band light curve with a striking feature: a late-time,long-lasting achromatic rebrightening, rarely seen in such events. peaking inoptical and x-ray bands $\sim 35$ ks ($\sim 12.5$ ks in the grb rest frame)after the 70-s grb prompt burst, the feature brightens nearly two orders ofmagnitude above the underlying optical power-law decay. modelling themultiwavelength light curves, we investigate possible causes of therebrightening in the context of the standard fireball model. we exclude a rangeof scenarios for the origin of this feature: reverse-shock flash, late-timeforward shock peak due to the passage of the maximal synchrotron frequencythrough the optical band, late central engine optical/x-ray flares, interactionbetween the expanding blast wave and a density enhancement in the circumburstmedium and gravitational microlensing. instead we conclude that the achromaticrebrightening may be caused by a refreshed forward shock or a geometricaleffect. in addition, we identify an additional component after the end of theprompt emission, that shapes the observed x-ray and optical light curvesdifferently, ruling out a single overall emission component to explain theobserved early time emission.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

0804.0811	the early-time optical properties of gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present a multiwavelength analysis of 63 gamma-ray bursts observed withthe world's three largest robotic optical telescopes, the liverpool and faulkestelescopes (north and south). optical emission was detected for 24 grbs withbrightnesses ranging from r = 10 to 22 mag in the first 10 minutes after theburst. by comparing optical and x-ray light curves from t = 100 to about 10^6seconds, we introduce four main classes, defined by the presence or absence oftemporal breaks at optical and/or x-ray wavelengths. while 15/24 grbs can bemodelled with the forward-shock model, explanation of the remaining nine isvery challenging in the standard framework even with the introduction of energyinjection or an ambient density gradient. early x-ray afterglows, even segmentsof light curves described by a power-law, may be due to additional emissionfrom the central engine. 39 grbs in our sample were not detected and have deepupper limits (r &lt; 22 mag) at early time. of these, only ten were identified byother facilities, primarily at near infrared wavelengths, resulting in a darkburst fraction of about 50%. additional emission in the early time x-rayafterglow due to late-time central engine activity may also explain some darkbursts by making the bursts brighter than expected in the x-ray band comparedto the optical band.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

1503.08428	radio flares from gamma-ray bursts	we present predictions of centimeter and millimeter radio emission fromreverse shocks in the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with the goal ofdetermining their detectability with current and future radio facilities. usinga range of grb properties, such as peak optical brightness and time, isotropicequivalent gamma-ray energy and redshift, we simulate radio light curves in aframework generalized for any circumburst medium structure and including aparametrization of the shell thickness regime that is more realistic than thesimple assumption of thick- or thin-shell approximations. building on earlierwork by mundell et al. (2007) and melandri et al. (2010) in which the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock was suggested to lie at radio, rather thanoptical wavelengths at early times, we show that the brightest and mostdistinct reverse-shock radio signatures are detectable up to 0.1 -- 1 day afterthe burst, emphasizing the need for rapid radio follow-up. detection is easierfor bursts with later optical peaks, high isotropic energies, lower circumburstmedium densities, and at observing frequencies that are less prone tosynchrotron self-absorption effects - typically above a few ghz. given recentdetections of polarized prompt gamma-ray and optical reverse-shock emission, wesuggest that detection of polarized radio/mm emission will unambiguouslyconfirm the presence of low-frequency reverse shocks at early time.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1506.05463	the rate and luminosity function of long gamma ray bursts	we derive, adopting a direct method, the luminosity function and theformation rate of long gamma ray bursts through a complete, flux-limited,sample of swift bursts which has a high level of completeness in redshift z(~82%). we parametrise the redshift evolution of the grb luminosity as l =l_0(1+ z)^k and we derive k = 2.5, consistently with recent estimates. thede-evolved luminosity function of grbs can be represented by a broken power lawwith slopes a = -1.32 +- 0.21 and b = -1.84 +- 0.24 below and above,respectively, a characteristic break luminosity l_0,b = 10^51.45+-0.15 erg/s.under the hypothesis of luminosity evolution we find that the grb formationrate increases with redshift up to z~2, where it peaks, and then decreases inagreement with the shape of the cosmic star formation rate. we test the directmethod through numerical simulations and we show that if it is applied toincomplete (both in redshift and/or flux) grb samples it can misleadinglyresult in an excess of the grb formation rate at low redshifts.

0808.2610	grb 070714b - discovery of the highest spectroscopically confirmed short  burst redshift	we detect the optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 070714b. ourobservations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the lightcurve forapproximately the first 5 to 25 minutes, then steepening to a powerlaw decaywith index alpha= 0.86 +/- 0.10 for the period between 1 to 24 hours postburst. this is consistent with the x-ray light-curve which shows an initialplateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. at late time, we detect a hostgalaxy at the location of the optical transient. gemini nod &amp; shufflespectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167angstroms which, based on a grizjhk photometric redshift, we conclude is the3727 angstrom [o ii] line. we therefore find a redshift of z=0.923. thisredshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determinationof grb 070429b at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds theprevious highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z=0.546for grb 051221. this dramatically moves back the time at which we know shortbursts were being formed, and suggests that the present evidence for an oldprogenitor population may be observationally biased.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.

astro-ph;0611732	the circumburst environment of a fred grb: study of the prompt emission  and x-ray/optical afterglow of grb 051111	we report a multi-wavelength analysis of the prompt emission and earlyafterglow of grb051111 and discuss its properties in the context of currentfireball models. the detection of grb051111 by the burst alert telescopeon-board swift triggered early bvri' observations with the 2-m robotic faulkestelescope north in hawaii, as well as x-ray observations with the swift x-raytelescope. the prompt gamma-ray emission shows a classical fred profile. theoptical afterglow light curves are fitted with a broken power law, withalpha_1=0.35 to alpha_2=1.35 and a break time around 12 minutes after the grb.although contemporaneous x-ray observations were not taken, a power lawconnection between the gamma-ray tail of the fred temporal profile and the latexrt flux decay is feasible. alternatively, if the x-ray afterglow tracks theoptical decay, this would represent one of the first grbs for which thecanonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early x-ray afterglows has beenmonitored optically. we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsicextinction, elemental abundances and spectral energy distribution. from theabsorption measured in the low x-ray band we find possible evidence for anoverabundance of some alpha elements such as oxygen, [o/zn]=0.7+/-0.3, or,alternatively, for a significant presence of molecular gas. the ir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution measured at 80 minutes after the burst isconsistent with the cooling break lying between the optical and x-ray bands.extensive modelling of the intrinsic extinction suggests dust with big grainsor grey extinction profiles. the early optical break is due either to an energyinjection episode or, less probably, to a stratified wind environment for thecircumburst medium.

astro-ph;0701087	the prompt to late-time multiwavelength analysis of grb 060210	we present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric &amp; spectroscopicobservations of grb 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context ofcurrent grb models. all available optical data underwent a simultaneoustemporal fit, while x-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &amp;spectrally. the results were compared to each other and to possible grb models.the x-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with abreak at 7.4 hours. the late optical afterglow has a well constrained singlepower-law index which has a value between the two x-ray indices, though it doesagree with a single power-law fit to the x-ray. an evolution of the hardness ofthe high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinctionfrom a comparison of the extrapolated x-ray flux to that measured in theoptical. we find that the flaring gamma-ray and x-ray emission is likely due tointernal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to theexternal shock. the late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break betweenthe optical and x-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time ofthe break. the required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while atthe high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
