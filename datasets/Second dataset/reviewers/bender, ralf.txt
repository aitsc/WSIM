0901.3778	correlations between supermassive black holes, velocity dispersions, and  mass deficits in elliptical galaxies with cores	high-dynamic-range surface photometry in a companion paper makes possibleaccurate measurement of the stellar light deficits l_def and mass deficitsm_def associated with the cores of elliptical galaxies. we show that l_defcorrelates with the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy bulge averagedoutside the central region that may be affected by a supermassive black hole(bh). we confirm that l_def correlates with bh mass mbh. also, the fractionallight deficit l_def/l correlates with mbh/m, the ratio of bh mass to the galaxystellar mass. all three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller thanthe scatter in the well known correlation between mbh and sigma. the newcorrelations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals withcores and those with central extra light. core light deficit correlates closelywith mbh and sigma, but extra light does not. this supports the suggestion thatextra light es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core es are madein dry mergers. after dry mergers, cores are believed to be scoured by bhbinaries that fling stars away as their orbits decay or by bhs that sink backto the center after recoiling from anisotropic gravitational radiation emittedwhen they merge. direct evidence has been elusive. we interpret the newcorrelations as the "smoking gun" that connects cores with bhs. together, thembh - sigma and mbh - l_def correlations give us two independent ways toestimate bh masses in core ellipticals.

0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

0912.2511	do black hole masses scale with classical bulge luminosities only? the  case of the two composite pseudobulge galaxies ngc3368 and ngc3489	it is now well established that all galaxies with a massive bulge componentharbour a central supermassive black hole (smbh). the mass of the smbhcorrelates with bulge properties such as the bulge mass and the velocitydispersion, which implies that the bulge and the smbh of a galaxy have growntogether during the formation process. the spiral galaxy ngc3368 and the s0galaxy ngc3489 both host a pseudobulge and a much smaller classical bulgecomponent at the centre. we present high resolution, near-infrared ifu data ofthese two galaxies, taken with sinfoni at the vlt, and use axisymmetric orbitmodels to determine the masses of the smbhs. the smbh mass of ngc3368 ism_bh=7.5x10^6 m_sun with an error of 1.5x10^6 m_sun, which mostly comes fromthe non-axisymmetry in the data. for ngc3489, a solution without black holecannot be excluded when modelling the sinfoni data alone, but can be clearlyruled out when modelling a combination of sinfoni, oasis and sauron data, forwhich we obtain m_bh=6.00^{+0.56}_{-0.54} (stat) +/- 0.64 (sys) x 10^6 m_sun.although both galaxies seem to be consistent with the m_bh-sigma relation, atface value they do not agree with the relation between bulge magnitude andblack hole mass when the total bulge magnitude (i.e., including both classicalbulge and pseudobulge) is considered; the agreement is better when only thesmall classical bulge components are considered. however, taking into accountthe ageing of the stellar population could change this conclusion.

(2) hst photometry shows that theabove galaxies contain tiny pseudobulges that make up &lt;~ 3 % of the stellarmass but no classical bulges. we inventory a sphere of radius 8 mpc centered onour galaxy to see whether giant, pure-disk galaxies are common or rare. in thisvolume, 11 of 19 galaxies with rotation velocity &gt; 150 km/s show no evidencefor a classical bulge. four may contain small classical bulges that contribute5-12% of the galaxy light. only 4 of the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals orhave classical bulges that contribute 1/3 of the galaxy light. so pure-diskgalaxies are far from rare. it is hard to understand how they could form as thequiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories. recognition ofpseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy formationmore acute: how can hierarchical clustering make so many giant, pure-diskgalaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges? this problem dependsstrongly on environment: the virgo cluster is not a puzzle, because &gt;2/3 of itsstellar mass is in merger remnants.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1101.4650	supermassive black holes do not correlate with dark matter halos of  galaxies	supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that containbulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough so that thesearches were feasible. together with the observation that bigger black holeslive in bigger bulges, this has led to the belief that black hole growth andbulge formation regulate each other. that is, black holes and bulges"coevolve". therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes andthe dark matter halos in which visible galaxies are embedded have profoundimplications. dark matter is likely to be nonbaryonic, so these reports suggestthat unknown, exotic physics controls black hole growth. here we show - basedin part on recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies - that there is almost nocorrelation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unlessthe galaxy also contains a bulge. we conclude that black holes do not correlatedirectly with dark matter. they do not correlate with galaxy disks, either.therefore black holes coevolve only with bulges. this simplifies the puzzle oftheir coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in thegalaxy mergers that make bulges.

1303.3005	photometric redshifts and systematic variations in the seds of luminous  red galaxies from the sdss dr7	we describe the construction of a template set of spectral energydistributions (seds) for the estimation of photometric redshifts of luminousred galaxies (lrgs) with a bayesian template fitting method. by examining thecolor properties of several publicly available sed sets within a redshift rangeof 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 and comparing them to sdss dr7 data, we show that only some of theinvestigated seds approximately match the colors of the lrg data throughout theredshift range, however not at the quantitative level required for precisephotometric redshifts. we generate new seds by superposing model seds ofcomposite stellar populations with a burst model, allowing both components tobe reddened by dust, in order to match the data in five different redshiftbins. we select a set of seds which represents the lrg data in color spacewithin five redshift bins, thus defining our new sed template set forphotometric redshift estimates. the results we get with the new template setand our bayesian template fitting photometric redshift code (photoz) are nearlyunbiased, with a scatter of \sigma(\delta z)=0.027 (including outliers), and afraction of catastrophic outliers (|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&gt;0.15) of 0.12%.we show that templates that optimally describe the brightest galaxies(-24.5&lt;m_r&lt;-22.7) indeed vary from z=0.1 to z=0.5, consistent with aging of thestellar population. furthermore, we find that templates that optimally describegalaxies at z&lt;0.1 strongly differ as a function of the absolute magnitude ofthe galaxies, indicating an increase in star formation activity for lessluminous galaxies. our findings based on the photometry of the sdss lrgs andour sed template fitting are supported by comparison to the average sdss lrgspectra in different luminosity and redshift bins.

1310.1914	searching for transits in the wts with difference imaging light curves	the wide field camera transit survey is a pioneer program aimed to search forextra-solar planets in the near-infrared. the standard data reduction pipelineof the program uses aperture photometry to construct the light curves. wealternatively apply the difference imaging method for the most complete fieldin the survey and carry out a quantitative comparison between the photometricprecision of both methods for objects with j&lt;18. we also report animplementation on the box-fitting detection algorithm, which performs atrapezoid-fit to the folded light curve. subsequently a set of selectioncriteria are optimized and applied to the light curves to search for transitcandidates, incorporating a parameter to characterize the shape of the transit.we carry out a detailed analysis in the 18 best detections and classify them astransiting planet and eclipsing binary candidates. one planet candidateorbiting a late g-type star is reported. no planet candidate around m-stars hasbeen found, which enabled us to set an upper limit on the occurrence rate ofshort period giant planets around m-dwarfs in the survey of 1.1%. furthermorewe report the detection of five faint extremely-short period eclipsing binarysystems with periods shorter than 0.23 days and three candidate m-dwarf/m-dwarfeclipsing binaries. the detections demonstrate the benefits of using thedifference imaging light curves especially when going to fainter magnitudes.

1312.4799	the black hole mass and the stellar ring in ngc 3706	we determine the mass of the nuclear black hole ($m$) in ngc 3706, an earlytype galaxy with a central surface brightness minimum arising from an apparentstellar ring, which is misaligned with respect to the galaxy's major axis atlarger radii. we fit new hst/stis and archival data with axisymmetric orbitmodels to determine $m$, mass-to-light ratio ($\upsilon_v$), and dark matterhalo profile. the best-fit model parameters with 1$\sigma$ uncertainties are $m= (6.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}) \times 10^8\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ and$\upsilon_v = 6.0 \pm 0.2\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}\ l_{{\scriptscriptstyle\odot},v}^{-1}$ at an assumed distance of 46 mpc. the models are inconsistentwith no black hole at a significance of $\delta\chi^2 = 15.4$ and require adark matter halo to adequately fit the kinematic data, but the fits areconsistent with a large range of plausible dark matter halo parameters. thering is inconsistent with a population of co-rotating stars on circular orbits,which would produce a narrow line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd).instead, the ring's losvd has a small value of $|v|/\sigma$, the ratio of meanvelocity to velocity dispersion. based on the observed low $|v|/\sigma$, ourorbit modeling, and a kinematic decomposition of the ring from the bulge, weconclude that the stellar ring contains stars that orbit in both directions. weconsider potential origins for this unique feature, including multiple tidaldisruptions of stellar clusters, a change in the gravitational potential fromtriaxial to axisymmetric, resonant capture and inclining of orbits by a binaryblack hole, and multiple mergers leading to gas being funneled to the center ofthe galaxy.

1404.2272	re-growth of stellar disks in mature galaxies: the two component nature  of ngc 7217 revisited with virus-w	previous studies have reported the existence of two counter-rotating stellardisks in the early-type spiral galaxy ngc7217. we have obtained high-resolutionoptical spectroscopic data (r ~ 9000) with the new fiber-based integral fieldunit instrument virus-w at the 2.7m telescope of the mcdonald observatory intexas. our analysis confirms the existence of two components. however, we findthem to be co-rotating. the first component is the more luminous (~ 77% of thetotal light), has the higher velocity dispersion (~ 170 km/s) and rotatesrelatively slowly (projected $v_{max}$ = 50 km/s). the lower luminosity secondcomponent, (~ 23% of the total light), has a low velocity dispersion (~ 20km/s) and rotates quickly (projected $v_{max}$ = 150 km/s). the difference inthe kinematics of the two stellar components allows us to perform a kinematicdecomposition and to measure the strengths of their mg and fe lick indicesseparately. the rotational velocities and dispersions of the less luminous andfaster component are very similar to those of the interstellar gas as measuredfrom the [oiii] emission. morphological evidence of active star formation inthis component further suggests that ngc7217 may be in the process of(re)growing a disk inside a more massive and higher dispersion stellar halo.the kinematically cold and regular structure of the gas disk in combinationwith the central almost dust-free morphology allows us to compare the dynamicalmass inside of the central 500pc with predictions from a stellar populationanalysis. we find agreement between the two if a kroupa stellar initial massfunction is assumed.

1405.1431	redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of massive galaxies from  sdss-iii/boss	we study the redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of ~180,000massive galaxies from sdss-iii/boss combined with a local early-type galaxysample from sdss-ii in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt; 0.6. the typical stellar massof this sample is mstar~2x10^{11} msun. we analyze the evolution of the galaxyparameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift. as the effective radii of boss galaxies atthese redshifts are not well resolved in the sdss imaging we calibrate the sdsssize measurements with hst/cosmos photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. wefurther apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consistsof a coeval, passively evolving population. systematic errors due to sizecorrection and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through montecarlo simulations. at fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderateevolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement withprevious studies. we show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift at &gt;2sigma significance. by combining oursample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of thedynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z&gt;2 as mdyn/mstar~(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase ofmdyn/mstar with cosmic time. this result is in line with recent predictionsfrom galaxy formation simulations based on minor merger driven mass growth, inwhich the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius increases withcosmic time.

1405.1722	central rotations of milky way globular clusters	most milky way globular clusters (gcs) exhibit measurable flattening, even ifon a very low level. both cluster rotation and tidal fields are thought tocause this flattening. nevertheless, rotation has only been confirmed in ahandful of gcs, based mostly on individual radial velocities at large radii. weare conducting a survey of the central kinematics of galactic gcs using the newintegral field unit instrument virus-w. we detect rotation in all 11 gcs thatwe have observed so far, rendering it likely that a large majority of the milkyway gcs rotate. we use published catalogs of the acs survey of gcs to derivecentral ellipticities and position angles. we show that in all cases where thecentral ellipticity permits an accurate measurement of the position angle,those angles are in excellent agreement with the kinematic position angles thatwe derive from the virus-w velocity fields. we find an unexpected tightcorrelation between central rotation and outer ellipticity, indicating thatrotation drives flattening for the objects in our sample. we also find a tightcorrelation between central rotation and published values for the centralvelocity dispersion, most likely due to rotation impacting the old dispersionmeasurements.

1405.4854	dwarf galaxy dark matter density profiles inferred from stellar and gas  kinematics	we present new constraints on the density profiles of dark matter (dm) halosin seven nearby dwarf galaxies from measurements of their integrated stellarlight and gas kinematics. the gas kinematics of low mass galaxies frequentlysuggest that they contain constant density dm cores, while n-body simulationsinstead predict a cuspy profile. we present a data set of high resolutionintegral field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gaskinematics simultaneously. using jeans modeling on our full sample, we examinewhether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than arederived from the stars. although 2/7 galaxies show some localized differencesin their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the centrallogarithmic slope of the dm density profile, gamma, are generally robust. themean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population aregamma=0.67+/-0.10 when measured in the stars and gamma=0.58+/-0.24 whenmeasured in the gas. we also find that the halos are not under concentrated atthe radii of half their maximum velocities. finally, we search for correlationsof the dm density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonicproperties. two popular mechanisms to explain cored dm halos are an exotic dmcomponent or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae intorepeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the dm halos. we investigatecorrelations that may eventually be used to test models. we do not find asecondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central dm density slope,but we do find some weak correlations. determining the importance of thesecorrelations will require further model developments and larger observationalsamples.

1411.2599	composite bulges: the coexistence of classical bulges and disky  pseudobulges in s0 and spiral galaxies	we study nine s0-sb galaxies with (photometric) bulges consisting of twodistinct components. the outer component is a flattened, kinematically cool,disklike structure: a "disky pseudobulge". embedded inside is a rounder,kinematically hot spheroid: a "classical bulge". this indicates thatpseudobulges and classical bulges are not mutually exclusive: some galaxieshave both.  the disky pseudobulges almost always have an exponential disk (scale lengths= 125-870 pc, mean $\sim 440$ pc) with disk-related subcomponents: nuclearrings, bars, and/or spiral arms. they constitute 11-59% of the galaxy stellarmass (mean pb/t = 0.33), with stellar masses $\sim 7 \times 10^{9}$-$9 \times10^{10} m_{\odot}$. classical-bulge components have sersic indices of 0.9-2.2,effective radii of 25-430 pc and stellar masses of $5 \times 10^{8}$-$3 \times10^{10} m_{\odot}$ (usually &lt; 10% of the galaxy's stellar mass; mean b/t =0.06). the classical bulges show rotation, but are kinematically hotter thanthe disky pseudobulges. dynamical modeling of three systems indicates thatvelocity dispersions are isotropic in the classical bulges and equatoriallybiased in the disky pseudobulges.  in the mass--radius and mass--stellar mass density planes, classical-bulgecomponents follow sequences defined by ellipticals and (larger) classicalbulges. disky pseudobulges also fall on this sequence; they are more compactthan similar-mass large-scale disks. although some classical bulges are quitecompact, they are distinct from nuclear star clusters in both size and mass,and coexist with nuclear clusters in at least two galaxies.  since almost all the galaxies in this study are barred, they probably alsohost boxy/peanut-shaped bulges (vertically thickened inner parts of bars). ngc3368 shows evidence for such a zone outside its disky pseudobulge, making it agalaxy with all three types of "bulge".

1501.02840	environment-based selection effects of planck clusters	we investigate whether the large scale structure environment of galaxyclusters imprints a selection bias on sunyaev zel'dovich (sz) catalogs. such aselection effect might be caused by line of sight (los) structures that add tothe sz signal or contain point sources that disturb the signal extraction inthe sz survey. we use the planck psz1 union catalog (planck collab- oration etal. 2013a) in the sdss region as our sample of sz selected clusters. wecalculate the angular two-point correlation function (2pcf) for physicallycorrelated, foreground and background structure in the redmapper sdss dr8catalog with respect to each cluster. we compare our results with an opticallyselected comparison cluster sample and with theoretical predictions. incontrast to the hypothesis of no environment-based selection, we find a mean2pcf for background structures of -0.049 on scales of $\lesssim 40'$,significantly non-zero at $\sim 4 \sigma$, which means that planck clusters aremore likely to be detected in regions of low background density. we hypothesizethis effect arises either from background estimation in the sz survey or fromradio sources in the background. we estimate the defect in sz signal caused bythis effect to be negligibly small, of the order of $\sim 10^{-4}$ of thesignal of a typical planck detection. analogously, there are no implications onx-ray mass measurements. however, the environ- mental dependence has importantconsequences for weak lensing follow up of planck galaxy clusters: we predictthat projection effects account for half of the mass contained within a 15'radius of planck galaxy clusters. we did not detect a background underdensityof cmass lrgs, which also leaves a spatially varying redshift dependence of theplanck sz selection function as a possible cause for our findings.

1507.07936	the properties and the formation mechanism of the stellar  counter-rotating components in ngc 4191	we disentangle two counter-rotating stellar components in ngc 4191 andcharacterize their physical properties (kinematics, morphology, age,metallicity, and abundance ratio). we performed a spectroscopic decompositionon integral field data to separate the contribution of two stellar componentsto the observed galaxy spectrum across the field of view. we also performed aphotometric decomposition, modelling the galaxy with a s\'ersic bulge and twoexponential disks of different scale length, with the aim of associating thesestructural components with the kinematic components. we measured the equivalentwidth of the absorption line indices on the best fit that represent thekinematic components and compared our measurements to the predictions ofstellar population models. we have evidence that the line-of-sight velocitydistributions (losvds) are consistent with the presence of two distinctkinematic components. the combined information of the intensity of the losvdsand photometry allows us to associate the s\'ersic bulge and the outer diskwith the main kinematic component, and the inner disk with the secondarykinematic component. the two kinematic stellar components counter-rotate withrespect to each other. the main component is the most luminous and massive, andit rotates slower than the secondary component, which rotates along the samedirection as the ionized gas. we also found that the two kinematic componentshave the same solar metallicity and sub-solar abundance ratio, without thepresence of significant radial gradients. on the other hand, their ages showstrong negative gradients and the possible indication that the secondarycomponent is the youngest. we interpret our results in light of recentcosmological simulations and suggest gas accretion along two filaments as theformation mechanism of the stellar counter-rotating components in ngc 4191(abridged).

astro-ph;0012381	dynamical family properties and dark halo scaling relations of giant  elliptical galaxies	based on a uniform dynamical analysis of line-profile shapes for 21 luminousround elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relationsof ellipticals: (i) the circular velocity curves (cvcs) of elliptical galaxiesare flat to within ~10% for r&gt;~0.2r_e. (ii) most ellipticals are moderatelyradially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)elliptical galaxies follow a tully-fisher (tf) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/sfor an l_b^* galaxy. at given v_c^max, they are ~1 mag fainter in b and appearto have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals even for maximum m/l_b. (iv)the luminosity dependence of m/l_b is confirmed. the tilt of the fundamentalplane is not caused by dynamical non-homology, nor only by an increasing darkmatter fraction with l. it is, however, consistent with stellar populationmodels based on published metallicities and ages. the main driver is thereforeprobably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explainthe k-band tilt. (v) these results make it likely that elliptical galaxies havenearly maximal m/l_b (minimal halos). (vi) despite the uniformly flat cvcs,there is a spread in cumulative m/l_b(r). some galaxies have no indication fordark matter within 2r_e, whereas others have local m/l_bs of 20-30 at 2r_e.(vii) in models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10-40%of the mass within r_e. (viii) the corresponding halo core densities andphase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same v_c^max. the increase in m/lsets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. this could imply thatelliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshift or that some of the darkmatter in ellipticals might be baryonic.

astro-ph;0202166	the epochs of early-type galaxy formation in clusters and in the field	we compute new population synthesis models of lick absorption line indiceswith variable alpha/fe ratios and use them to derive average ages,metallicities, and alpha/fe element enhancements for a sample of 126 field andcluster early-type galaxies. calibrating the models on galactic globularclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellarlibraries of the milky way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/feratios at metallicities below solar. we correct for this bias, so that themodels presented here reflect constant alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities.the use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systemswith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarfgalaxies.  for the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation betweenalpha/fe and velocity dispersion. zero-point, slope, and scatter of thiscorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. additionally, thealpha/fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.galaxies with high alpha/fe ratios have also high average ages. this stronglyreinforces the view that the alpha/fe element enhancement in ellipticals isproduced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of theinitial mass function. the more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its starformation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of starformation, independent of the environmental density. we show that this findingis incompatible with the predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models,in which star formation is tightly linked to the assembly history of darkmatter halos.

astro-ph;0203468	the slope of the black-hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation	observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the massof the central dark object m and the velocity dispersion sigma of the hostgalaxy, of the form log(m/m_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, publishedestimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). merritt &amp; ferraresehave argued that low slopes (&lt;4) arise because of neglect of random measurementerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of themilky way galaxy. we show that these explanations account for at most a smallpart of the slope range. instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because ofsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups forthe same galaxies. the origin of these differences remains unclear, but wesuggest that one significant component of the difference results from ferrarese&amp; merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is theeffective radius) using an empirical formula. another component may arise fromdispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. a new determinationof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, forsigma_0=200 km/s. the m-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log mthat is no larger than 0.3 dex. in an appendix, we present a simple model forthe velocity-dispersion profile of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0209250	stellar population models of lick indices with variable element  abundance ratios	we provide the whole set of lick indices from cn1 to tio2 of simple stellarpopulation models with, for the first time, variable element abundance ratios,[alpha/fe]=0.0, 0.3, 0.5, [alpha/ca]=-0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, and [alpha/n]=-0.5,0.0. the models cover ages between 1 and 15 gyr, metallicities between 1/200and 3.5 solar. our models are free from the intrinsic alpha/fe bias that wasimposed by the milky way template stars up to now, hence they reflectwell-defined alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities. the models are calibratedwith milky way globular clusters for which metallicities and alpha/fe ratiosare known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. the metallicitiesthat we derive from the lick indices mgb and fe5270 are in excellent agreementwith the metallicity scale by zinn &amp; west (1984), and we show that the latterprovides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. we can reproduce therelatively strong cn-absorption features cn1 and cn2 of galactic globularclusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. anenhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with theindices mg1 and c24668. the calcium sensitive index ca4227 of globular clustersis well matched by our models with [ca/fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich bulgeclusters ngc 6528 and ngc 6553. from our alpha/fe enhanced models we infer thatthe index [mgfe] defined by gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/fe,but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/fe. we define a slightmodification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/fe andserves best as a tracer of total metallicity. searching for blue indices thatgive similar information as mgb and fe, we find that cn1 and fe4383 may be bestsuited to estimate alpha/fe ratios of objects at redshifts z~1.

astro-ph;0209483	axisymmetric dynamical models of the central regions of galaxies	we present axisymmetric, orbit superposition models for 12 galaxies usingdata taken with the hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-basedobservatories. in each galaxy, we detect a central black hole (bh) and measureits mass to accuracies ranging from 10% to 70%. we demonstrate that in mostcases the bh detection requires both the hst and ground-based data. using theground-based data alone does provide an unbiased measure of the bh mass(provided they are fit with fully general models), but at a greatly reducedsignificance. the most significant correlation with host galaxy properties isthe relation between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the hostgalaxy; we find no other equally strong correlation, and no second parameterthat improves the quality of the mass-dispersion relation. we are also able tomeasure the stellar orbital properties from these general models. the mostmassive galaxies are strongly biased to tangential orbits near the bh,consistent with binary bh models, while lower-mass galaxies have a range ofanisotropies, consistent with an adiabatic growth of the bh.

astro-ph;0303615	new clues on the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies	we use our new stellar population models, which include effects from variableelement abundance ratios, to model the ca4227 absorption line indices ofearly-type galaxies (trager et al.), and to derive calcium element abundances.we find that calcium, although being an alpha-element, is depressed withrespect to the other alpha-elements by up to a factor 2. this confirmsquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calciumunderabundant. we find a clear correlation between alpha/ca ratio and centralvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calciumunderabundant. interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarfspheroidal galaxies of the local group for which alpha/ca ratios have beenmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (shetrone etal.). the increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances thehigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundancein early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increasewith increasing galaxy mass. this result may be the key to understand why thecaii triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 a is constant to within5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (saglia et al.; cenarroet al.). the origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxiesremains yet to be understood. we argue that formation timescales aredisfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option ofmetallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track tofollow.

astro-ph;0403257	black hole mass determinations from orbit superposition models are  reliable	we show that orbit-superposition dynamical models (schwarzschild's method)provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors whenconstructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. we thus rebut tworecent papers that argue that bh masses obtained from this method areunreliable. these papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable bhmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result ofan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamicalmodels. this is an elementary error that is easily avoided. we describe amethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. weprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sensethat the range of allowable bh masses is not artificially narrowed by use oftoo few orbits. a second point raised by critics is that kinematic data aregenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliablemass. we make the distinction between unreliable determinations and impreciseones. we show that there are several different properties of a kinematicdataset that can lead to imprecise bh determinations, but none of theattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. in short,the degree to which the bh radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopicobservations is already reflected in the bh-mass error envelope, and is not ahidden source of error. the bh masses published by our group and the leidengroup are reliable.

[mgfe]' is used as aspectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/fe]variations. we introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously deriveages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructedfrom lick indices. from a comparison of high-quality data with ssp modelpredictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxiesare older than 10 gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 gyr, and only afew cluster are younger than ~5 gyr. our sample of globular clusters coversmetallicities from [z/h] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. we find that metal-richglobular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatterthan their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/fe] diagnostic plots show thatglobular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/feabundance ratios with a mean [alpha/fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion ofabout 0.3 dex. we find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/fe] andmetallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit loweralpha-element enhancements.

astro-ph;0703792	the munich near-infrared cluster survey (munics) - ix. galaxy evolution  to z ~ 2 from optically selected catalogues	(abridged) we present b, r, and i-band selected galaxy catalogues based onthe munich near-infrared cluster survey (munics) which, together with thek-selected sample, serve as an important probe of galaxy evolution in theredshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 2. furthermore, used in comparison they are ideallysuited to study selection effects. the construction of the b, r, and i-selectedphotometric catalogues, containing ~9000, ~9000, and ~6000 galaxies,respectively, is described in detail. the catalogues reach 50% completenesslimits for point sources of b ~ 24.5mag, r ~ 23.5mag, and i ~ 22.5mag and coveran area of about 0.3 square degrees. photometric redshifts are derived for allgalaxies with an accuracy of dz/(1+z) ~ 0.057. we investigate the influence ofselection band and environment on the specific star formation rate (ssfr). wefind that k-band selection indeed comes close to selection in stellar mass,while b-band selection purely selects galaxies in star formation rate. we use agalaxy group catalogue constructed on the k-band selected munics sample tostudy possible differences of the ssfr between the field and the groupenvironment, finding a marginally lower average ssfr in groups as compared tothe field, especially at lower redshifts. the field-galaxy luminosity functionin the b and r band as derived from the r-selected sample evolves out to z ~ 2in the sense that the characteristic luminosity increases but the numberdensity decreases. this effect is smaller at longer rest-frame wavelengths andgets more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. parametrising the redshiftevolution of the schechter parameters as m*(z) = m*(0) + a ln(1+z) and phi*(z)= phi*(0) (1+z)^b we find evolutionary parameters a ~ -2.1 and b ~ -2.5 for theb band, and a ~ -1.4 and b ~ -1.8 for the r band.

astro-ph;9604125	the redshift evolution of the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies	velocity dispersions $\sigma$ and mg absorption line-strengths mg$_b$ havebeen measured for a sample of 16 ellipticals in 3 clusters at a redshift of0.37. like local cluster ellipticals, these objects show a correlation betweenmg$_b$ and $\sigma$. however, at any given $\sigma$, the mean mg$_b$ of theellipticals at $z=0.37$ is weaker than the mean mg$_b$ of their local relativesin the coma and virgo clusters. the mg$_b$ weakening is smallest for the mostluminous ellipticals and larger for the fainter objects. this is unambiguousevidence for {\it small but significant passive evolution} of the stellarpopulations of elliptical galaxies with redshift. it requires that the bulk ofthe stars in cluster ellipticals has formed at $z&gt;2$. the most luminous objectsmay even have formed at $z&gt;4$. the mg$_b-\sigma$ test is a very reliableestimator for the evolution of old stellar populations because it is virtuallyindependent from the stellar initial mass function (imf) and from themetallicities of the galaxies. furthermore, the influence of selection effectsis minimal.

astro-ph;9701084	the mg-sigma relation of elliptical galaxies at various redshifts	the correlation between the mg absorption index and the velocity dispersion(sigma) of local elliptical galaxies is very tight. because the mg absorptiondepends on both metallicity and age of the underlying stellar population theobserved mg-sigma relation constrains the possible variation in metallicity andage for a given velocity dispersion. for a time interval with no change inmetallicity any variation of the mg index is caused only by the aging of thestars.  we have measured the mg absorption and velocity dispersion of ellipticals inthree clusters at a redshift of z=0.37 and established their mg-sigma relation.for any given sigma, the measured mg absorption is weaker than the mean valuefor local ellipticals. since the evolution of bright cluster ellipticalsbetween z=0.4 and today is most probably only `passive' this reduction in mgcan be attributed solely to the younger age of the stellar population. thesmall weakening of the mg absorption of the distant galaxies compared to thelocal values implies that most of the stars in cluster ellipticals must haveformed at high redshifts (z_f &gt; 2...4).  the mg-sigma test is a very robust method to investigate the evolution ofelliptical galaxies and has several advantages over traditional methods usingluminosities. a remaining problem is the aperture correction necessary tocalibrate observations of galaxies at different distances. here, we show thatour general conclusions about the epoch of formation still hold when aperturecorrections are calculated assuming a dependence of the radial gradient ofsigma on the galaxy's effective radius rather than assuming no dependence aswas done in all previous studies.

astro-ph;9701204	structure, formation and ages of elliptical galaxies	the structural properties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with theirformation in a merging hierarchy. in this picture, the role of gaseousprocesses and dissipation decreased with increasing mass creatingpreferentially rotationally flattend disky ellipticals (and s0s) at lowerluminosities and boxy, anisotropic ellipticals (often with peculiar kinematics)at higher luminosities. however, gas and dissipation processes must have beenimportant even in the formation of the most luminous ellipticals. they playedkey roles in determining the phase space structure of es and possibly ensured atight fundamental plane. the bulk of the stars in the majority of luminouscluster ellipticals formed at redshifts above two, likely above three. thisfollows from their homogenous colors and line strengths and their essentiallypassive evolution with redshift. low luminosity ellipticals (and probably fieldellipticals) may have had extended star formation histories, possiblyassociated with the presence of disks. the star-formation time-scales canpresumably be constrained on the basis of abundance ratios and seem to beinversely related to galaxy mass. massive ellipticals are likely to have formedthe bulk of their stars within one gigayear.

astro-ph;9703188	spectroscopic evidence for a supermassive black hole in ngc 4486b	the stellar kinematics of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 4486b have beenmeasured in seeing sigma_* = .22 arcsec with the canada-france-hawaiitelescope. lauer et al. 1996, apj, 471, l79 have shown that ngc 4486b issimilar to m31 in having a double nucleus. we show that it also resembles m31in its kinematics. the velocity dispersion gradient is very steep: sigmaincreases from 116 +- 6 km/s at r = 2" - 6" to 281 +- 11 km/s at the center.this is much higher than expected for an elliptical galaxy of absolutemagnitude m_b = -16.8: ngc 4486b is far above the scatter in the faber-jacksoncorrelation between sigma and bulge luminosity. therefore the king coremass-to-light ratio, m/l_v = 20, is unusually high compared with normal valuesfor old stellar populations. we construct dynamical models with isotropicvelocity dispersions and show that they reproduce black hole (bh) massesderived by more detailed methods. we also fit axisymmetric, three-integralmodels. isotropic models imply that ngc 4486b contains a central dark object,probably a bh, of mass m_bh = 6^{+3}_{-2} x 10^8 m_sun. however, anisotropicmodels fit the data without a bh if the ratio of radial to azimuthaldispersions is ~ 2 at 1". therefore this is a less strong bh detection than theones in m31, m32, and ngc 3115. a 6 x 10^8 m_sun bh is 9 % of the mass m_bulgein stars; even if m_bh is smaller than the isotropic value, m_bh/m_bulge islikely to be unusually large. double nuclei are a puzzle because the dynamicalfriction timescales for self-gravitating star clusters in orbit around eachother are short. since both m31 and ngc 4486b contain central dark objects, ourresults support models in which the survival of double nuclei is connected withthe presence of a bh (e. g., tremaine 1995, aj, 110, 628).

astro-ph;9704280	the mgb-sigma relation of elliptical galaxies at z=0.37	we derive absorption indices of ellipticals in clusters at z=0.37 frommedium-resolution spectroscopy together with kinematical parameters. thesegalaxies exhibit a relationship between the mgb linestrength and their internalvelocity dispersion similar to local dynamically hot galaxies. but for anygiven sigma, mgb of the distant ellipticals is significantly lower than themean value of the nearby sample. the difference of mgb between the two samplesis small and can be fully attributed to the younger age of the distant stellarpopulations in accordance with the passive evolution model. the low reductionof mgb at a look-back time of about 5 gyrs requires that the bulk of the starsin cluster ellipticals have formed at very high redshifts of z_f&gt;2. for themost massive galaxies, where the reduction is even lower, z_f probably exceeds4.  unlike most methods to measure the evolution of ellipticals usingluminosities, surface brightnesses or colours, the mgb linestrength does notdepend on corrections for extinction and cosmic expansion (k-correction) andonly very little on the slope of the initial mass function. the combination ofa kinematical parameter with a stellar population indicator allows us to studythe evolution of very similar objects. in addition, the good mass estimateprovided by sigma means that the selection criteria for the galaxy sample as awhole are well controlled.

astro-ph;9707037	global relationships among the physical properties of stellar systems	the kappa-space three-dimensional parameter system was originally defined forthe physical properties of dynamically hot galaxies. here we defineself-consistent kappa-parameters for disk galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters,and globular clusters and project an integrated view of the major classes ofself-gravitating, equilibrium stellar systems in the universe. six differentfundamental planes exist that are interrelated and interconnected - the``cosmic metaplane.'' the kappa-3 vs. kappa-1 projection (m/l vs. mass) viewsall planes edge-on, m/l increasing or constant with mass. within the cosmicmetaplane (kappa-2 vs. kappa-1 projection), no stellar system violates the rulethat kappa-1 + kappa-2 &lt; 8, meaning the maximum volume luminosity density ofstellar systems varies as a (k times m^{-4/3}; the ``zone of exclusion'').galaxies march away from zoe as a function of hubble type: dhgs closest,sm-irr's furthest away. we test current ideas of galaxy formation viahierarchical clustering and merging and find them to be broadly consistent withthe properties of the cosmic metaplane. four key questions are raised by thisstudy: why do galaxy groups form a bridge between galaxy clusters and galaxies?why do galaxies march away from the zoe? why are isotropic galaxies only foundin a limited mass range? what causes m/l to vary so smoothly with m to producethe cosmic metaplane? this study is but the first step along a long road,limited by existing data to the b passband of major stellar systems, whoselight is dominated by stars. k-band data would be high desirable, as well asdata that can probe the gaseous content (cold and hot) of stellar systems, anddata for other classes of stellar systems.

astro-ph;9708072	the demography of massive dark objects in galaxy centres	we construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with hubblespace telescope photometry and ground-based kinematics. the models assume thateach galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function,arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratioupsilon, and a central massive dark object (mdo) of arbitrary mass m_bh. theyprovide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of m_bh andupsilon; the four galaxies that cannot be fit have kinematically decoupledcores. the mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fit galaxies areconsistent with the fundamental plane correlation upsilon \propto l^0.2, wherel is galaxy luminosity. in all but six galaxies the models require at the 95%confidence level an mdo of mass m_bh ~ 0.006 m_bulge = 0.006 upsilon l. five ofthe six galaxies consistent with m_bh=0 are also consistent with thiscorrelation. the other (ngc 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on m_bh. weconsider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describingthe correlation of the masses of these mdos with other galaxy properties. oneof the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~0.97 of galaxies havemdos, whose masses are well described by a gaussian distribution in log(m_bh/m_bulge) of mean -2.27 and width ~0.07.

astro-ph;9712176	the kinematically peculiar cores of the coma cluster early -- type  galaxies ngc 4816 and ic 4051	the coma cluster is one of the richest known cluster of galaxies, spanningabout 4 dex in density. hence it is the ideal place to study the structure ofgalaxies as a function of environmental density in order to constrain thetheories of galaxy formation and evolution. for a magnitude limited sample of35 e and s0 galaxies we obtained long slit spectra to derive the rotationcurves, the velocity dispersion profiles and the radial gradients of the mg, feand h_beta line indices. here we report on two early -- type galaxies whichturned out to host the largest kinematically peculiar cores yet found in``normal'' early -- type galaxies: ngc 4816 hosts a decoupled counter rotatingcore with a radial extension along the major axis of 2.7 kpc, while ic 4051 hasa co-rotating peculiar core with a sizes of 3.4 kpc. we combine our data withhst photometry and show that both cores are flattened central stellar diskswhich contribute less than 1 % to the total v band light of the galaxies, butare nevertheless conspicuous (1 - 2 x 10**9 l_sun). the metallicity of thecores is 0.25 dex super solar and drops to solar and sub solar in the outerpart of ngc 4816 and ic 4051, respectively. the mean stellar population in bothcentral disks is old (8 - 12 gyr) and highly overabundant in mgb relative to&lt;fe&gt; (approximatly 0.5 dex). we discuss the evidence that these central disksformed via dissipational major merger events.

astro-ph;9811416	elliptical galaxies: detailed structure, scaling relations and formation	the last decade of research on elliptical galaxies has produced a wealth ofnew information concerning both their detailed structure and their globalscaling relations. we review the old and new results about isophote shapes andsubcomponents (sect. 1), scaling relations of global parameters and redshiftevolution (sect. 2), and the ages, metallicities (sect. 3) and abundance ratios(sect. 4). finally, we confront the observations with hierarchical formationscenarios of elliptical galaxies (sect. 5). the picture emerging from thisvariety of observational evidence is broadly consistent with the mergingscenario of hierarchical structure formation models, but the stellar populationproperties of ellipticals pose some challanges. the formation of ellipticalsmust have always involved some dissipation. the gas fraction at the last majormerger event presumably has strong influence on their present day properties.most elliptical galaxies are old systems, but disky ellipticals might beyounger than boxy objects and have more extended star formation histories. thesmall scatter and the redshift variations of the scaling relation arecompatible with passive evolution. the high mg/fe overabundances of luminous(boxy) ellipticals point to a rapid star formation episode, whilelow-luminosity objects have values of mg/fe nearly solar, allowing for anextended star formation history.

0810.1681	structure and formation of elliptical and spheroidal galaxies	new surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the virgo clusteris added to published data to derive composite profiles over large dynamicranges. sersic functions fit them remarkably well. effective brightnesses andradii are derived via sersic fits and by integrating the profilesnonparametrically. we strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) elliptical galaxiesfrom cds to m32 form a tight sequence in fundamental plane parameter space thatis almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from ngc 205 todraco. this is consistent with our understanding of their different formationprocesses: mergers for es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidalsby environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2)ellipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest es have cuspy cores;our 17 fainter es do not have cores. we find a new distinct component incoreless es. all have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolationof the outer sersic profile. we suggest that extra light is made by starburstsin dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. three other newaspects also point to an explanation of how the e-e dichotomy formed: extralight es were made in wet mergers while core es were made in dry mergers. weconfirm that core es do and extra light es generally do not contain x-ray gas.this suggests why the e-e dichotomy arose. only core es and their progenitorsare massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protectold star populations from late star formation.
