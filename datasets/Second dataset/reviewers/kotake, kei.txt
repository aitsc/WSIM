0904.2044	relativistic stars with purely toroidal magnetic fields with realistic  equations of state	we investigate equilibrium sequences of relativistic stars containing purelytoroidal magnetic fields with four kinds of realistic equations of state (eoss)of sly (douchin et al.), fps (pandharipande et al.), shen (shen et al.), and ls(lattimer &amp; swesty). we numerically construct thousands of equilibriumconfigurations. particularly we pay attention to the equilibrium sequences ofconstant baryon mass and/or constant magnetic flux, which model evolutions ofan isolated neutron star. important properties obtained in this study aresummarized as follows ; (1) the dependence of the mass-shedding angularvelocity on the eoss is determined from that of the non-magnetized case. thestars with shen(fps) eos reach the mass-shedding limit at the smallest(largest)angular velocity, while the stars with sly or lattimer-swesty eoss take themoderate values. (2) for the supramassive sequences, the equilibriumconfigurations are found to be generally oblate for the realistic eoss in sharpcontrast to the polytropic stars. for fps(ls) eos, the parameter region whichpermits the prolately deformed stars is widest(narrowest). for sly and sheneos, it is in medium. furthermore, the angular velocities $\omega_{\rm up}$,above which the stars start to spin up as they lose angular momentum, are foundto depend sharply on the realistic eoss. our analysis indicates that thehierarchy of this spin up angular velocity is $\omega_{\rm up,sly} &gt;\omega_{\rm up,fps} &gt; \omega_{\rm up,ls}&gt;\omega_{\rm up,shen}$ and thisrelation holds even if the sequences have strong magnetic fields. our resultssuggest the eoss within the relativistic stars containing purely toroidalmagnetic fields can be constrained by observing the angular velocity, thegravitational wave, and the signature of the spin up.

0706.3495	gravitational wave background from population iii stars	we estimate the gravitational wave (gw) background from population iii (popiii) stars using the results from our hydrodynamic simulations (suwa et al.2007). we calculate gravitational waveforms from matter motions and anisotropicneutrino emissions for single pop iii stars. we find that the gw amplitudesfrom matter motions are dominant until just after bounce, but those fromneutrinos dominate later on at frequencies below $\sim 10$ hz in the gwspectrum. computing the overall signal produced by the ensemble of such pop iiistars, we find that the resultant density parameter of the gw background peaksat the amplitude of $\omega_\mathrm{gw}\sim 10^{-10}$ in the frequency interval$\sim 1-10$ hz. we show that such signals, depending on the formation rate ofpop iii stars, can be within the detection limits of future plannedinterferometers such as decigo and bbo in the frequency interval of $\sim0.1-1$ hz. our results suggest that the detection of the gw background from popiii stars can be an important tool to supply the information about the starformation history in the early universe.

0905.2006	long-term evolution of slowly rotating collapsar in special relativistic  magnetohydrodynamics	we present our numerical results of two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd)simulations of the collapse of rotating massive stars in light of the collapsarmodel of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). pushed by recent evolution calculations ofgrb progenitors, we focus on lower angular momentum of the central core thanthe ones taken mostly in previous studies. by performing special relativisticsimulations including both realistic equation of state and neutrino coolings,we follow a unprecedentedly long-term evolution of the slowly rotatingcollapsars up to $\sim$ 10 s, accompanied by the formation of jets andaccretion disks. our results show that for the grb progenitors to function ascollapsars, there is a critical initial angular momentum, below which matter isquickly swallowed to the central objects, no accretion disks and no mhdoutflows are formed. when larger than the criteria, we find the launch of themhd jets in the following two ways. for models with stronger initial magneticfields, the magnetic pressure amplified inside the accretion disk can drive themhd outflows, which makes the strong magnetic explosions like a 'magnetictower' (type ii). for the models with weaker initial magnetic fields, themagnetic tower stalls first and the subsequent mhd outflows are produced bysome eventual inflows of the accreting material from the equator to the polarregions (type i). regardless of type i or ii, the jets can attain only mildlyrelativistic speeds with the explosion energy less than $10^{49} \erg$, whichcould possibly be related to the x-ray flashes. due to high opacity forneutrinos inside the disk, we find that the luminosities of $\nu_e$ and$\bar{\nu}_e$ become almost comparable, which is advantageous for making theenergy deposition rate larger.

0906.3180	neutrino oscillations in magnetically driven supernova explosions	we investigate neutrino oscillations from core-collapse supernovae thatproduce magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) explosions. by calculating numerically theflavor conversion of neutrinos in the highly non-spherical envelope, we studyhow the explosion anisotropy has impacts on the emergent neutrino spectrathrough the mikheyev-smirnov-wolfenstein effect. in the case of the invertedmass hierarchy with a relatively large theta_(13), we show that survivalprobabilities of electron type neutrinos and antineutrinos seen from therotational axis of the mhd supernovae (i.e., polar direction), can besignificantly different from those along the equatorial direction. the eventnumbers of electron type antineutrinos observed from the polar direction arepredicted to show steepest decrease, reflecting the passage of themagneto-driven shock to the so-called high-resonance regions. furthermore wepoint out that such a shock effect, depending on the original neutrino spectra,appears also for the low-resonance regions, which leads to a noticeabledecrease in the electron type neutrino signals. this reflects a unique natureof the magnetic explosion featuring a very early shock-arrival to the resonanceregions, which is in sharp contrast to the neutrino-driven delayed supernovamodels. our results suggest that the two features in the electron typeantineutrinos and neutrinos signals, if visible to the super-kamiokande for agalactic supernova, could mark an observational signature of the magneticallydriven explosions, presumably linked to the formation of magnetars and/orlong-duration gamma-ray bursts.

0909.3622	ray-tracing analysis of anisotropic neutrino radiation for estimating  gravitational waves in core-collapse supernovae	we propose a ray-tracing method to estimate gravitational waves (gws)generated by anisotropic neutrino emission in supernova cores. to calculate thegravitational waveforms, we derive analytic formulae in a useful form, whichare applicable also for three-dimensional computations. pushed by evidence ofslow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrinoemission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. based on thetwo-dimensional (2d) models, which mimic sasi-aided neutrino heatingexplosions, we compute the neutrino anisotropies via the ray-tracing method ina post-processing manner and calculate the resulting waveforms. with thesecomputations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrastto the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., kotake etal. (2007)). in addition to a positively growing feature, which was predictedto determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shownto exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of sasi.these features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission inlateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracingcalculation. due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptionsappropriately taken into account by the ray-tracing method, the wave amplitudesbecome more than one-order-of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation,thus making their detections very hard for a galactic source.on the other hand,it is pointed out that the gw spectrum from matter motions have its peak near$\sim 100$ hz, which could be characteristic for the sasi-induced supernovaexplosions.(abridged)

1004.2896	gravitational wave signatures of magnetohydrodynamically-driven  core-collapse supernova explosions	by performing a series of two-dimensional, special relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations, we study signatures of gravitationalwaves (gws) in the magnetohydrodynamically-driven core-collapse supernovae. inorder to extract the gravitational waveforms, we present a stress formulaincluding contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativisticcorrections. by changing the precollapse magnetic fields and initial angularmomentum distributions parametrically, we compute twelve models. as for themicrophysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrinocooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme.  with these computations, we find that the total gw amplitudes show amonotonic increase after bounce for models with a strong precollapse magneticfield ($10^{12}$g) also with a rapid rotation imposed.  we show that this trend stems both from the kinetic contribution of mhdoutflows with large radial velocities and also from the magnetic contributiondominated by the toroidal magnetic fields that predominantly trigger mhdexplosions. for models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the total gwamplitudes after bounce stay almost zero, because the contribution from themagnetic fields cancels with the one from the hydrodynamic counterpart.  these features can be clearly understood with a careful analysis on theexplosion dynamics. we point out that the gw signals with the increasing trend,possibly visible to the next-generation detectors for a galactic supernova,would be associated with mhd explosions with the explosion energies exceeding$10^{51}$ erg.

0704.1945	magnetorotational collapse of population iii stars	we perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapsesimulations of pop iii stars. changing the initial distributions of rotationand magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19models. by so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magneticfields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of theblack-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. as for themicrophysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate theneutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. with these computations, wefind that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock wavesif the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ g. we point out that theblack-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, onthe other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. as for the neutrinoproperties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays animportant role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is moredominant than the others. furthermore, we find that the stronger magneticfields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magneticpressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to thesuppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

1007.3165	general relativistic ray-tracing method for estimating the energy and  momentum deposition by neutrino pair annihilation in collapsars	bearing in mind the application to the collapsar models of gamma-ray bursts(grbs), we develop a numerical scheme and code for estimating the deposition ofenergy and momentum due to the neutrino pair annihilation ($\nu + {\bar \nu}\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$) in the vicinity of accretion tori around a kerrblack hole. our code is designed to solve the general relativistic neutrinotransfer by a ray-tracing method. to solve the collisional boltzmann equationin curved spacetime, we numerically integrate the so-called rendering equationalong the null geodesics. for the neutrino opacity, the charged-current$\beta$-processes are taken into account, which are dominant in the vicinity ofthe accretion tori. the numerical accuracy of the developed code iscertificated by several tests, in which we show comparisons with thecorresponding analytic solutions. based on the hydrodynamical data in ourcollapsar simulation, we estimate the annihilation rates in a post-processingmanner. increasing the kerr parameter from 0 to 1, it is found that the generalrelativistic effect can increase the local energy deposition rate by about oneorder of magnitude, and the net energy deposition rate by several tens ofpercents. after the accretion disk settles into a stationary state (typicallylater than $\sim 9$ s from the onset of gravitational collapse), we point outthat the neutrino-heating timescale in the vicinity of the polar funnel regioncan be shorter than the dynamical timescale. our results suggest the neutrinopair annihilation has a potential importance equal to the conventionalmagnetohydrodynamic mechanism for igniting the grb fireballs.

0708.3597	equilibrium configurations of strongly magnetized neutron stars with  realistic equations of state	we investigate equilibrium sequences of magnetized rotating stars with fourkinds of realistic equations of state (eoss) of sly (douchin et al.), fps(pandharipande et al.), shen (shen et al.), and ls (lattimer &amp; swesty).employing the tomimura-eriguchi scheme to construct the equilibriumconfigurations. we study the basic physical properties of the sequences in theframework of newton gravity. in addition we newly take into account a generalrelativistic effect to the magnetized rotating configurations. with thesecomputations, we find that the properties of the newtonian magnetized stars,e.g., structure of magnetic field, highly depends on the eoss.  the toroidal magnetic fields concentrate rather near the surface for shen andls eoss than those for sly and fps eoss. the poloidal fields are also affectedby the toroidal configurations. paying attention to the stiffness of the eoss,we analyze this tendency in detail. in the general relativistic stars, we findthat the difference due to the eoss becomes small because all the employed eossbecome sufficiently stiff for the large maximum density, typically greater than$10^{15}\rm{g} \rm{cm}^{-3}$. the maximum baryon mass of the magnetized starswith axis ratio $q\sim 0.7$ increases about up to twenty percents for that ofspherical stars. we furthermore compute equilibrium sequences at finitetemperature, which should serve as an initial condition for the hydrodynamicstudy of newly-born magnetars. our results suggest that we may obtaininformation about the eoss from the observation of the masses of magnetars.

1012.4080	magnetic field decay due to the wave-particle resonances in the outer  crust of the neutron star	bearing in mind the application to the outer crust of the neutron stars(nss), we investigate the magnetic field decay by means of the fullyrelativistic particle-in-cell simulations. numerical computations are carriedout in 2-dimensions, in which the initial magnetic fields are set to becomposed both of the uniform magnetic fields that model the global fieldspenetrating the ns and of the turbulent magnetic fields that would beoriginated from the hall cascade of the large-scale turbulence. our resultsshow that the whistler cascade of the turbulence transports the magnetic energypreferentially in the direction perpendicular to the uniform magnetic fields.it is also found that the distribution function of electrons becomesanisotropic because electrons with lower energies are predominantly heated inthe direction parallel to the uniform magnetic fields due to the landauresonance, while electrons with higher energies are heated mainly by thecyclotron resonance that makes the distribution function isotropic for the highenergy tails. furthermore we point out that the degree of anisotropy takesmaximum as a function of the initial turbulent magnetic energy. as analternative to the conventional ohmic dissipation, we propose that the magneticfields in the outer crust of nss, cascading down to the electron inertial scalevia the whistler turbulence, would decay predominantly by the dissipationprocesses through the landau damping and the cyclotron resonance.

0709.1795	numerical simulations of equatorially-asymmetric magnetized supernovae:  formation of magnetars and their kicks	a series of numerical simulations on magnetorotational core-collapsesupernovae are carried out. dipole-like configurations which are offsetnorthward are assumed for the initially strong magnetic fields together withrapid differential rotations. aims of our study are to investigate effects ofthe offset magnetic field on magnetar kicks and on supernova dynamics. notethat we study a regime where the proto-neutron star formed after collapse has alarge magnetic field strength approaching that of a ``magnetar'', a highlymagnetized slowly rotating neutron star. as a result, equatorially-asymmetricexplosions occur with a formation of the bipolar jets. resultant magnetar'skick velocities are $\sim 300-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. we find that the accelerationis mainly due to the magnetic pressure while the somewhat weaker magnetictension works toward the opposite direction, which is due to stronger magneticfield in the northern hemisphere. noted that observations of magnetar's propermotions are very scarce, our results supply a prediction for futureobservations. namely, magnetars possibly have large kick velocities, severalhundred km s$^{-1}$, as ordinary neutron stars do, and in an extreme case theycould have those up to 1000 km s$^{-1}$.

1106.5487	impacts of collective neutrino oscillations on supernova explosions	by performing a series of one- and two-dimensional (1-, 2d) hydrodynamicsimulations with spectral neutrino transport, we study possible impacts ofcollective neutrino oscillations on the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae.to model the spectral swapping which is one of the possible outcome of thecollective neutrino oscillations, we parametrize the onset time when thespectral swap begins, the radius where the spectral swap occurs, and thethreshold energy above which the spectral interchange between heavy-leptonneutrinos and electron/anti-electron neutrinos takes place, respectively. bydoing so, we systematically study how the neutrino heating enhanced by thespectral swapping could affect the shock evolution as well as the matterejection. we also investigate the progenitor dependence using a suite ofprogenitor models (13, 15, 20, and 25 $m_\odot$). we find that there is acritical heating rate induced by the spectral swapping to trigger explosions,which significantly differs between the progenitors. the critical heating rateis generally smaller for 2d than 1d due to the multidimensionality thatenhances the neutrino heating efficiency. for the progenitors employed in thispaper, the final remnant masses are estimated to range in 1.1-1.5$m_\odot$. forour 2d model of the $15m_\odot$ progenitor, we find a set of the oscillationparameters that could account for strong supernova explosions ($\sim 10^{51}$erg), simultaneously leaving behind the remnant mass close to $\sim 1.4m_\odot$.

(shen) in core-collapse supernova simulations, weexplore possible impacts of these eos on the post-bounce dynamics prior to theonset of neutrino-driven explosions. our spherically symmetric (1d) and axiallysymmetric (2d) models are based on neutrino radiation hydrodynamics includingspectral transport, which is solved by the isotropic diffusion sourceapproximation. we confirm that in 1d simulations neutrino-driven explosionscannot be obtained for any of the employed eos. impacts of the eos on thepost-bounce hydrodynamics are more clearly visible in 2d simulations. in 2dmodels of a 15 m_sun progenitor using the ls eos, the stalled bounce shockexpands to increasingly larger radii, which is not the case using the shen eos.keeping in mind that the omission of the energy drain by heavy-lepton neutrinosin the present scheme could facilitate explosions, we find that 2d models of an11.2 m_sun progenitor produce neutrino-driven explosions for all the eos underinvestigation. models using the ls eos are slightly more energetic compared tothose with the shen eos. the more efficient neutrino heating in the ls modelscoincides with a higher electron antineutrino luminosity and a larger mass thatis enclosed within the gain region. the models based on the ls eos also show amore vigorous and aspherical downflow of accreting matter to the surface of theprotoneutron star (pns). the accretion pattern is essential for the productionand strength of outgoing pressure waves, that can push in turn the shock tolarger radii and provide more favorable conditions for the explosion.[abbreviated]

1207.5955	revisiting impacts of nuclear burning for reviving weak shocks in  neutrino-driven supernovae	we revisit potential impacts of nuclear burning on the onset of theneutrino-driven explosions of core-collapse supernovae. by changing theneutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions inone-(1d) and two-dimensional (2d) models with or without a 13-isotope alphanetwork, we study how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect thepostbounce dynamics for four progenitor models; three for 15.0 msun stars, onefor an 11.2 msun star. we find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning ofinfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especiallyfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclearburning. these models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shockfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches theoxygen-rich layer. depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, adiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for modelswith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. we point outthat these features are most remarkable for the limongi-chieffi progenitor inboth 1d and 2d, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layerwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, sothat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. theenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2d than in1d (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). this is because neutrino-driven convectionand the shock instability in 2d models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,which makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to1d models. considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicatethat nuclear burning should remain as one of the important ingredients tofoster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions.

1211.6817	effects of resistivity on magnetized core-collapse supernovae	we studied roles of a turbulent resistivity in the core-collapse of astrongly magnetized massive star, carrying out 2d-resistive-mhd simulations.the three cases with different initial strengths of magnetic field and rotationare investigated; 1. strongly magnetized rotating core; 2.moderately magnetizedrotating core; 3. very strongly magnetized non-rotating core. in each case,both an ideal-mhd model and resistive-mhd models are computed. as a result ofcomputations, each model shows a matter eruption helped by a magneticacceleration (and also by a centrifugal acceleration in the rotating cases). wefound that a resistivity attenuates the explosion in case~1 and 2, while itenhances the explosion in case~3. we also found that in the rotating cases,main mechanisms for the amplification of a magnetic field in the post-bouncephase are an outward advection of magnetic field and a winding of poloidalmagnetic field-lines by differential rotation, which are somewhat dampened downwith the presence of a resistivity. although the magnetorotational instabilityseems to occur in the rotating models, it will play only a minor role in amagnetic field amplification. another impact of resistivity is that on theaspect ratio. in the rotating cases, a large aspect ratio of the ejectedmatters, $&gt; 2.5$, attained in a ideal-mhd model is reduced to some extent in aresistive model. these results indicate that a resistivity possibly plays animportant role in the dynamics of strongly magnetized supernovae.

0712.1949	special relativistic simulations of magnetically-dominated jets in  collapsing massive stars	we perform a series of two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic core-collapsesimulations of rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized massive stars. to studythe properties of magnetic explosions for a longer time stretch of postbounceevolution, we develop a new code under the framework of special relativityincluding a realistic equation of state with a multiflavor neutrino leakagescheme. our results show the generation of the magnetically-dominated jets inthe two ways. one is launched just after the core-bounce in a prompt way andanother is launched at $ \sim 100 $ ms after the stall of the prompt shock. wefind that the shock-revival occurs when the magnetic pressure becomes strong,due to the field wrapping, enough to overwhelm the ram pressure of theaccreting matter. the critical toroidal magnetic fields for the magneticshock-revival are found to be universal of $\sim 10^{15}\mathrm{g}$ behind thejets. we point out that the time difference before the shock-revival has astrong correlation with the explosions energies. our results suggest that themagnetically dominated jets are accompanied by the formation of the magnetars.since the jets are mildly relativistic, we speculate that they might be theorigin of some observed x-ray flashes.

1304.4372	gravitational wave signatures from low-mode spiral instabilities in  rapidly rotating supernova cores	we study properties of gravitational waves (gws) from rotating core-collapseof a 15m_odot star by performing three-dimensional general-relativistichydrodynamic simulations with an approximate neutrino transport. byparametrically changing the precollapse angular momentum, we focus on theeffects of rotation on the gw signatures in the early postbounce evolution.regarding three-flavor neutrino transport, we solve the energy-averaged set ofradiation energy and momentum based on the thorne's momentum formalism. inaddition to the gravitational quadrupole radiation from matter motions, we takeinto account gws from anisotropic neutrino emission. with these computations,our results present several supporting evidences for the previous anticipationthat non-axisymmetric instabilities play an essential role in determining thepostbounce gw signatures. during prompt convection, we find that the waveformsshow narrow-band and highly quasi-periodic signals which persist until the endof simulations. we point out that such feature reflects the growth of theone-armed spiral modes. the typical frequency of the quasi-periodic waveformscan be well explained by the propagating acoustic waves between the stalledshock and the rotating proto-neutron star surface, which suggests theappearance of the standing-accretion-shock instability. although the gw signalsexhibit strong variability between the two polarizations and different observerdirections, they are within the detection limits of next generation detectorssuch as by kagra and advanced ligo, if the source with sufficient angularmomentum is located in our galaxy.

1308.5755	a comparison of two- and three-dimensional neutrino-hydrodynamics  simulations of core-collapse supernovae	we present numerical results on two- (2d) and three-dimensional (3d)hydrodynamic core-collapse simulations of an 11.2$m_\odot$ star. by changingnumerical resolutions and seed perturbations systematically, we study how thepostbounce dynamics is different in 2d and 3d. the calculations were performedwith an energy-dependent treatment of the neutrino transport based on theisotropic diffusion source approximation scheme, which we have updated toachieve a very high computational efficiency. all the computed models in thiswork including nine 3d models and fifteen 2d models exhibit the revival of thestalled bounce shock, leading to the possibility of explosion. all of them aredriven by the neutrino-heating mechanism, which is fostered by neutrino-drivenconvection and the standing-accretion-shock instability (sasi). reflecting thestochastic nature of multi-dimensional (multi-d) neutrino-driven explosions,the blast morphology changes from models to models. however, we find that thefinal fate of the multi-d models whether an explosion is obtained or not, islittle affected by the explosion stochasticity. in agreement with some previousstudies, higher numerical resolutions lead to slower onset of the shock revivalin both 3d and 2d. based on the self-consistent supernova models leading to thepossibility of explosions, our results systematically show that the revivedshock expands more energetically in 2d than in 3d.

1401.2723	an investigation into surface temperature distributions of high-b  pulsars	bearing in mind the application to high-magnetic-field (high-b) radiopulsars, we investigate two-dimensional (2d) thermal evolutions of neutronstars (nss). we pay particular attention to the influence of differentequilibrium configurations on the surface temperature distributions. theequilibrium configurations are constructed in a systematic manner, in whichboth toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields are determined self-consistentlywith the inclusion of general relativistic effects. to solve the 2d heattransfer inside the ns interior out to the crust, we have developed an implicitcode based on a finite-difference scheme that deals with anisotropic thermalconductivity and relevant cooling processes in the context of a standardcooling scenario. in agreement with previous studies, the surface temperaturesnear the pole become higher than those in the vicinity of the equator as aresult of anisotropic heat transfer. our results show that the ratio of thehighest to the lowest surface temperatures changes maximally by one order ofmagnitude, depending on the equilibrium configurations. despite suchdifference, we find that the area of such hot and cold spots is so small thatthe simulated x-ray spectrum could be well reproduced by a single temperatureblackbody fitting.

1403.7290	impacts of rotation on three-dimensional hydrodynamics of core-collapse  supernovae	we perform a series of simplified numerical experiments to explore howrotation impacts on the three-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamics of core-collapsesupernovae. for the sake of our systematic study, we employ a light-bulb schemeto trigger explosions and a three-flavor neutrino leakage scheme to treatdeleptonization effects and neutrino losses from proto-neutron star interior.using a 15 solar mass progenitor, we compute thirty models in 3d with a widevariety of initial angular momentum and light-bulb neutrino luminosity. we findthat the rotation can help onset of neutrino-driven explosions for the modelsin which the initial angular momentum is matched to that obtained in recentstellar evolutionary calculations (0.3-3 rad/s at the center). for the modelswith larger initial angular momentum, the shock surface deforms to be moreoblate due to larger centrifugal force. this makes not only a gain region moreconcentrated around the equatorial plane, but also the mass in the gain regionbigger. as a result, buoyant bubbles tend to be coherently formed and rise inthe equatorial region, which pushes the revived shock ever larger radii until aglobal explosion is triggered. we find that these are the main reasons that thepreferred direction of explosion in 3d rotating models is often perpendicularto the spin axis, which is in sharp contrast to the polar explosions around theaxis that was obtained in previous 2d simulations.

1406.2415	systematic features of axisymmetric neutrino-driven core-collapse  supernova models in multiple progenitors	we present an overview of two-dimensional (2d) core-collapse supernovasimulations employing neutrino transport scheme by the isotropic diffusionsource approximation. we study 101 solar-metallicity, 247 ultra metal-poor, and30 zero-metal progenitors covering zero-age main sequence mass from $10.8m_{\odot} $ to $75.0 m_{\odot} $. using the 378 progenitors in total, wesystematically investigate how the differences in the structures of thesemultiple progenitors impact the hydrodynamics evolution. by following along-term evolution over 1.0 s after bounce, most of the computed modelsexhibit neutrino-driven revival of the stalled bounce shock at $\sim$ 200 - 800ms postbounce, leading to the possibility of explosion. pushing the boundariesof expectations in previous one-dimensional (1d) studies, our results confirmthat the compactness parameter $\xi$ that characterizes the structure of theprogenitors is also a key in 2d to diagnose the properties of neutrino-drivenexplosions. models with high $\xi$ undergo high ram pressure from the accretingmatter onto the stalled shock, which affects the subsequent evolution of theshock expansion and the mass of the protoneutron star under the influence ofneutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion-shock instability. weshow that the accretion luminosity becomes higher for models with high $\xi$,which makes the growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy higher and thesynthesized nickel mass bigger. we find that these explosion characteristicstend to show a monotonic increase as a function of the compactness parameter$\xi$.

1406.6414	the criterion of supernova explosion revisited: the mass accretion  history	by performing neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations in sphericalsymmetry (1d) and axial symmetry (2d) with different progenitor models bywoosley &amp; heger (2007) from 12 $m_{\odot}$ to 100 $m_{\odot}$, we find that all1d runs fail to produce an explosion and several 2d runs succeed. thedifference in the shock evolutions for different progenitors can be interpretedby the difference in their mass accretion histories, which are in turndetermined by the density structures of progenitors. the mass accretion historyhas two phases in the majority of the models: the earlier phase in which themass accretion rate is high and rapidly decreasing and the later phase with alow and almost constant accretion rate. they are separated by the so-calledturning point, the origin of which is a change of the accreting layer. we arguethat shock revival will most likely occur around the turning point and hencethat its location in the $\dot m$-$l_\nu$ plane will be a good measure for thepossibility of shock revival: if the turning point lies above the criticalcurve and the system stays there for a long time, shock revival will obtain. inaddition, we develop a phenomenological model to approximately evaluate thetrajectories in the $\dot m$-$l_\nu$ plane, which, after calibrating freeparameters by a small number of 1d simulations, reproduces the location of theturning point reasonably well by using the initial density structure ofprogenitor alone. we suggest the application of the phenomenological model to alarge collection of progenitors in order to infer without simulations whichones are more likely to explode.

1409.0006	the red supergiant and supernova rate problems: implications for  core-collapse supernova physics	mapping supernovae to their progenitors is fundamental to understanding thecollapse of massive stars. we investigate the red supergiant problem, whichconcerns why red supergiants with masses $\sim16$-$30 m_\odot$ have not beenidentified as progenitors of type iip supernovae, and the supernova rateproblem, which concerns why the observed cosmic supernova rate is smaller thanthe observed cosmic star formation rate. we find key physics to solving thesein the compactness parameter, which characterizes the density structure of theprogenitor. if massive stars with compactness above $\xi_{2.5} \sim 0.2$ failto produce canonical supernovae, (i) stars in the mass range $16$-$30 m_\odot$populate an island of stars that have high $\xi_{2.5}$ and do not producecanonical supernovae, and (ii) the fraction of such stars is consistent withthe missing fraction of supernovae relative to star formation. we support thisscenario with a series of two- and three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamicscore-collapse simulations. using more than 300 progenitors covering initialmasses $10.8$-$75 m_\odot$ and three initial metallicities, we show that highcompactness is conducive to failed explosions. we then argue that a criticalcompactness of $\sim 0.2$ as the divide between successful and failedexplosions is consistent with state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapsesimulations. our study implies that numerical simulations of core collapse neednot produce robust explosions in a significant fraction of compact massive starinitial conditions.

1501.00966	coherent network analysis of gravitational waves from three-dimensional  core-collapse supernova models	using predictions from three-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamics simulations ofcore-collapse supernovae (ccsne), we present a coherent network analysis todetection, reconstruction, and the source localization of thegravitational-wave (gw) signals. we use the {\tt ridge} pipeline for theanalysis, in which the network of ligo hanford, ligo livingston, virgo, andkagra is considered. by combining with a gw spectrogram analysis, we show thatseveral important hydrodynamics features in the original waveforms persist inthe waveforms of the reconstructed signals. the characteristic excess in thespectrograms originates not only from rotating core-collapse, bounce and thesubsequent ring down of the proto-neutron star (pns) as previously identified,but also from the formation of magnetohydrodynamics jets and non-axisymmetricinstabilities in the vicinity of the pns. regarding the gw signals emitted nearat the rotating core bounce, the horizon distance extends up to $\sim$ 18 kpcfor the most rapidly rotating 3d model in this work. following the rotatingcore bounce, the dominant source of the gw emission shifts to thenon-axisymmetric instabilities. the horizon distances extend maximally up to$\sim$ 40 kpc seen from the spin axis. with an increasing number of 3d modelstrending towards explosion recently, our results suggest that in addition tothe best studied gw signals due to rotating core-collapse and bounce, the timeis ripe to consider how we can do science from gws of ccsne much more seriouslythan before. particularly the quasi-periodic signals due to thenon-axisymmetric instabilities and the detectability should deserve furtherinvestigation to elucidate the inner-working of the rapidly rotating ccsne.

0806.1072	impact of rotation on neutrino emission and relic neutrino background  from population iii stars	we study the effects of rotation on the neutrino emission from population iii(pop iii) stars by performing a series of two-dimensional rotational collapsesimulations of pop iii stellar cores. our results show that rotation enhancesthe neutrino luminosities and the average energies of emitted neutrinos. thisis because the thermalized inner core, which is the dominant neutrino sourcefrom pop iii stars, can be enlarged, due to rotational flattening, enough toextend the inner core outside the neutrinospheres. this is in sharp contrast tothe case of spherical collapse, in which the case of inner core shrinks deeperinside the neutrinospheres before black hole formation, which hinders theefficient neutrino emission. in the case of rotational core-collapse, theemitted neutrino energies are found to become larger in the vicinity near thepole than the ones near the equatorial plane. these factors make the emergentneutrino spectrum broader and harder than the spherical collapse case. bycomputing the overall neutrino signals produced by the ensemble of individualrotating pop iii stars, we find that the amplitudes of the relic neutrinos,depending on their star formation rates, can dominate over the contributionsfrom ordinary core-collapse supernovae below a few mev. a detection of thissignal could be an important tool to probe star formation history in the earlyuniverse.

0807.4514	determination of the angular momentum distribution of supernovae from  gravitational wave observations	significant progress has been made in the development of an internationalnetwork of gravitational wave detectors, such as tama300, ligo, virgo, andgeo600. for these detectors, one of the most promising sources of gravitationalwaves are core collapse supernovae especially in our galaxy. recent simulationsof core collapse supernovae, rigorously carried out by various groups, showthat the features of the waveforms are determined by the rotational profiles ofthe core, such as the rotation rate and the degree of the differential rotationprior to core-collapse. specifically, it has been predicted that the sign ofthe second largest peak in the gravitational wave strain signal is negative ifthe core rotates cylindrically with strong differential rotation. the sign ofthe second peak could be a nice indicator that provides us with informationabout the angular momentum distribution of the core, unseen withoutgravitational wave signals. here we present a data analysis procedure aiming atthe detection of the second peak using a coherent network analysis and estimatethe detection efficiency when a supernova is at the sky location of thegalactic center. the simulations showed we were able to determine the sign ofthe second peak under an idealized condition of a network of gravitational wavedetectors if a supernova occurs at the galactic center.

astro-ph;0409244	north-south neutrino heating asymmetry in strongly magnetized and  rotating stellar cores	we perform a series of two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations ofsupernova cores. since the distributions of the angular momentum and themagnetic fields of strongly magnetized stars are quite uncertain, wesystematically change the combinations of the strength of the angular momentum,the rotations law, the degree of differential rotation, and the profiles of themagnetic fields to construct the initial conditions. by so doing, we estimatehow the rotation-induced anisotropic neutrino heating are affected by thestrong magnetic fields through parity-violating effects and first investigatehow the north-south asymmetry of the neutrino heating in a strongly magnetizedsupernova core could be. as for the microphysics, we employ a realisticequation of state based on the relativistic mean field theory and take intoaccount electron captures and the neutrino transport via the neutrino leakagescheme. with these computations, we find that the parity-violating correctionsreduce $ \lesssim 0.5 %$ of the neutrino heating rate than that without themagnetic fields in the vicinity of the north pole of a star, on the other hand,enhance about $ \lesssim 0.5 %$ in the vicinity of the south pole. if theglobal asymmetry of the neutrino heating in the both of the poles develops inthe later phases, the newly born neutron star might be kicked toward the northpole in the subsequent time.

astro-ph;0505611	the core-collapse supernova with "non-uniform" magnetic fields	we perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of amassive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using anumerical code zeus-2d. changing field configurations and laws of differentialrotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of theseparameters on the dynamics. in our models, we do not solve the neutrinotransport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric eos that takes intoaccount the neutrino emissions. as a result of the calculations, we find thatthe field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core ifthe initial magnetic field is large enough. models with initially concentratedfields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than theuniform field. quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fastjet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(grb). the lorentz forcesexerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsiblefor these dynamics. the pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not leadto any explosion or matter ejection. this suggests the presupernova models ofheger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, isdisadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matterejection, either. in these models magnetic fields play no role as they do notgrow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressurecould be comparable to the matter pressure. this is because the exponentialfield growth as expected in mri is not seen in our models. the magnetic fieldis amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.

astro-ph;0602460	heavy element nucleosynthesis in a collapsar	we investigate synthesis of heavy elements in a collapsar. we have calculateddetailed composition of magnetically driven jets ejected from a collapsar,which is based on long-term, magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a rapidlyrotating massive star of 40msun during core collapse. we follow evolution ofabundances of about 4000 nuclides from the collapse phase to the ejection phasethrough the jet generation phase with use of two large nuclear reactionnetworks. we find that the r-process successfully operates in the jets, so thatu and th are synthesized abundantly when the progenitor has large magneticfield of 10^{12} g and rapidly rotating core. abundance pattern inside the jetsis similar compared to that of r-elements in the solar system. heavyneutron-rich nuclei \sim 0.01msun can be ejected from the collapsar. thedetailed abundances depend on nuclear properties of mass model, beta-decayrate, and fission, for nuclei near the neutron drip line. furthermore, we findthat p-nuclei are produced without seed nuclei: not only light p-nuclei, suchas se74, kr78, sr84, and mo92, but also heavy p-nuclei, in113, sn115, andla138, can be abundantly synthesized in the jets. the amounts of p-nuclei inthe ejecta are much greater than those in core-collapse supernovae (sne). inparticular, mo92, in113, sn115, and la138 deficient in the sne, aresignificantly produced in the ejecta.

astro-ph;0607224	gravitational radiation from standing accretion shock instability in  core-collapse supernovae	we present the results of numerical experiments, in which we study how theasphericities induced by the growth of the standing accretion shock instability(sasi) produce the gravitational waveforms in the postbounce phase ofcore-collapse supernovae. to obtain the neutrino-driven explosions, weparameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star andapproximate the neutrino transfer by a light-bulb scheme. we find that thewaveforms due to the anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increasewith time, whose amplitudes are up to two order-of-magnitudes larger than theones from the convective matter motions outside the protoneutron stars.  we point out that the amplitudes begin to become larger when the growth ofthe sasi enters the nonlinear phase, in which the deformation of the shocks andthe neutrino anisotropy become large. from the spectrum analysis of thewaveforms, we find that the amplitudes from the neutrinos are dominant over theones from the matter motions at the frequency below $\sim 100$ hz, which aresuggested to be within the detection limits of the detectors in the nextgeneration such as lcgt and the advanced ligo for a supernova at 10 kpc.  as a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show that theamplitudes from this source could be larger at the frequency above $\sim$ 1 hzthan the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds, but unfortunately,invisible to the proposed space-based detectors.

astro-ph;0702476	effects of qcd phase transition on gravitational radiation from  two-dimensional collapse and bounce of massive stars	we perform two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamical core-collapse simulationsof massive stars accompanying the qcd phase transition. we study how the phasetransition affects the gravitational waveforms near the epoch of core-bounce.as for initial models, we change the strength of rotation and magnetic fields.particularly, the degree of differential rotation in the iron core (fe-core) ischanged parametrically. as for the microphysics, we adopt a phenomenologicalequation of state above the nuclear density, including two parameters to changethe hardness before the transition. we assume the first order phase transition,where the conversion of bulk nuclear matter to a chirally symmetric quark-gluonphase is described by the mit bag model. based on these computations, we findthat the phase transition can make the maximum amplitudes larger up to $\sim$10 percents than the ones without the phase transition. on the other hand, themaximum amplitudes become smaller up to $\sim$ 10 percents owing to the phasetransition, when the degree of the differential rotation becomes larger. wefind that even extremely strong magnetic fields $\sim 10^{17}$ g in theprotoneutron star do not affect these results.

0811.0651	effects of rotation on standing accretion shock instability in nonlinear  phase for core-collapse supernovae	we studied the effects of rotation on standing accretion shock instability(sasi) by performing three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. taking intoaccount a realistic equation of state and neutrino heating/cooling, we prepareda spherically symmmetric and steady accretion flow through a standing shockwave onto a proto-neutron star (pns). when the sasi entered the nonlinearphase, we imposed uniform rotation on the flow advecting from the outerboundary of the iron core, whose specific angular momentum was assumed to agreewith recent stellar evolution models. using spherical harmonics in space andfourier decompositions in time, we performed mode analysis of the nonsphericaldeformed shock wave to observe rotational effects on the sasi in the nonlinearphase. we found that rotation imposed on the axisymmetric sasi did not make anyspiral modes and hardly affected sloshing modes, except for steady l=2, m=0modes. in contrast, rotation imposed on the non-axisymmetric flow increased theamplitude of spiral modes so that some spiral flows accreting on the pns weremore clearly formed inside the shock wave than without rotation. the amplitudesof spiral modes increased significantly with rotation in the progressivedirection.
