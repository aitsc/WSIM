0706.2759	molecular gas in nearby low-luminosity qso host galaxies	this paper addresses the global molecular gas properties of a representativesample of galaxies hosting low-luminosity quasistellar objects. an abundantsupply of gas is necessary to fuel both the active galactic nucleus and anycircum-nuclear starburst activity of qsos.  we selected a sample of nearby low-luminosity qso host galaxies that is freeof infrared excess biases. all objects are drawn from the hamburg-eso surveyfor bright uv-excess qsos, have dec&gt;-30 degrees and redshifts that do notexceed z=0.06. the iram 30m telescope was used to measure the co(1-0) andco(2-1) transition in parallel.  27 out of 39 galaxies in the sample have been detected. the molecular gasmasses of the detected sources range from 0.4e9 m_sun to 9.7e9 m_sun. we canconfirm that the majority of galaxies hosting low-luminosity qsos are rich inmolecular gas. the properties of galaxies hosting brighter type i agn andcircumnuclear starformation regions differ from the properties of galaxies withfainter central regions. the overall supply of molecular gas and the spread ofthe line width distribution is larger. when comparing the far-infrared with theco luminosities, the distribution can be separated into two differentpower-laws: one describing the lower activity seyfert i population and thesecond describing the luminous qso population. the separation in thel_fir/l'_co behavior may be explainable with differing degrees of compactnessof the emission regions. we provide a simple model to describe the twopower-laws. the sample studied in this paper is located in a transition regionbetween the two populations.

0903.3046	a co emission line from the optical and near-ir undetected submillimeter  galaxy gn10	we report the detection of a co emission line from the submillimiter galaxy(smg) gn10 in the goods-n field. gn10 lacks any counterpart in extremely deepoptical and near-ir imaging obtained with the hubble space telescope andground-based facilities. this is a prototypical case of a source that isextremely obscured by dust, for which it is practically impossible to derive aspectroscopic redshift in the optical/near-ir. under the hypothesis that gn10is part of a proto-cluster structure previously identified at z~4.05 in thesame field, we searched for co[4-3] at 91.4 ghz with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer, and successfully detected a line. we find that the most likelyredshift identification is z=4.0424+-0.0013, based on: 1) the very low chancethat the co line is actually serendipitous from a different redshift; 2) aradio-ir photometric redshift analysis; 3) the identical radio-ir sed, within ascaling factor, of two other smgs at the same redshift. the faintness atoptical/near-ir wavelengths requires an attenuation of a_v~5-7.5 mag. thisresult supports the case that a substantial population of very high-z smgsexists that had been missed by previous spectroscopic surveys. this is thefirst time that a co emission line has been detected for a galaxy that isinvisible in the optical and near-ir. our work demonstrates the power ofexisting and planned facilities for completing the census of star formation andstellar mass in the distant universe by measuring redshifts of the mostobscured galaxies through millimeter spectroscopy.

0707.1190	nuclear starburst-driven evolution of the central region in ngc 6764	we study the co and the radiocontinuum emission in an active galaxy toanalyze the interplay between the central activity and the molecular gas. wepresent new high-resolution observations of the co(1-0) and co(2-1) emissionlines, and 3.5 cm and 20 cm radio continuum emission in the central region ofthe liner/starburst galaxy ngc 6764. the galaxy has an outflow morphology inradio continuum, spatially coincident with the co and h$\alpha$ emission, andcentered slightly off the radio continuum peak at the liner nucleus. the totalmolecular gas mass in the center is about 7x10^8 \msun, using a co luminosityto total molecular gas conversion factor that is three times lower than thestandard one. co(1-0) emission is found near the boundaries of the radiocontinuum emission cone. the outflow has a projected expansion velocity of 25km/s relative to the systemic velocity of ngc6764. about 4x 10^6 \msun ofmolecular gas is detected in the outflow. the approximate location (~1 kpc) ofthe dynamical inner lindblad resonance has been derived from the rotationcurve. the peak of the co emission is slightly (&lt; 200 pc) offset from the peakof the radio continuum.  the molecular gas has most likely been ejected by the stellar winds from therecent starburst, but the co line ratios show indication of an interaction withthe agn. the energy released by the nuclear starburst is sufficient to explainthe observed outflow, even if the data cannot exclude the agn from being themajor energy source. comparison of the outflow with hydrodynamical simulationssuggests that the nuclear starburst is 3--7 myr old and the bubble-like outflowis still confined and not freely expanding.

0911.2776	very high gas fractions and extended gas reservoirs in z=1.5 disk  galaxies	we present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gasreservoirs in normal, near-infrared selected (bzk) galaxies at z~1.5, based onmulti-configuration co[2-1] observations obtained at the iram pdbi. six of thesix galaxies observed were securely detected. high resolution observationsresolve the co emission in four of them, implying sizes of order of 6-11 kpcand suggesting the presence of rotation. the uv morphologies are consistentwith clumpy, unstable disks, and the uv sizes are consistent with the co sizes.the star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low and similar to localspirals - the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 gyr, much higher than whatis seen in high-z submm galaxies and quasars. the co luminosities can bepredicted to within 0.15 dex from the star formation rates and stellar masses,implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. we usedynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses. thesemodels are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the coemission. after accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses we derive gasmasses of 0.4-1.2x10^11 msun. the conversion factor is very high:alpha_co=3.6+-0.8, consistent with the galaxy but four times higher than thatof local ultra-luminous ir galaxies. the gas accounts for an impressive 50-65%of the baryons within the galaxies' half light radii. we are witnessing trulygas-dominated galaxies at z~1.5, a finding that explains the high specific sfrsobserved for z&gt;1 galaxies. the bzk galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versionsof local disk galaxies, with low efficiency star formation taking place insideextended, low excitation gas disks. they are markedly different than localulirgs and high-z submm galaxies, which have more excited and compact gas.

1003.3205	the first iram/pdbi polarimetric millimeter survey of active galactic  nuclei. i. global properties of the sample	we have studied the linear polarization of 86 active galactic nuclei (agn) inthe observed frequency range 80-267 ghz (3.7-1.1mm in wavelength),corresponding to rest-frame frequencies 82-738 ghz, with the iram plateau debure interferometer (pdbi). the large number of measurements, 441, makes ouranalysis the largest polarimetric agn survey in this frequency range to date.we extracted polarization parameters via earth rotation polarimetry withunprecedented median precisions of ~0.1% in polarization fractions and ~1.2degrees in polarization angles. for 73 of 86 sources we detect polarization atleast once. the degrees of polarization are as high as ~19%, with the medianover all sources being ~4%. source fluxes and polarizations are typicallyhighly variable, with fractional variabilities up to ~60%. we find that bllacsources have on average the highest level of polarization. there appears to beno correlation between degree of polarization and redshift, indicating thatthere has been no substantial change of polarization properties since z~2.4.our polarization and spectral index distributions are in good agreement withresults found from various samples observed at cm/radio wavelengths; thus ourfrequency range is likely tracing the signature of synchrotron radiationwithout noticeable contributions from other emission mechanisms. the"millimeter-break" located at frequencies &gt;1 thz appears to be not detectablein the frequency range covered by our survey.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1005.5642	molecular gas in sauron early-type galaxies: detection of 13co and hcn  emission	in a pilot project to study the relationship between star formation andmolecular gas properties in nearby normal early-type galaxies, we used the iram30m telescope to observe the 13co(j=1-0), 13co(j=2-1), hcn(j=1-0) andhco+(j=1-0) line emission in the four galaxies of the sauron sample with thestrongest 12co emission. we report the detection of 13co emission in all foursauron sources and hcn emission in three sources, while no hco+ emission wasfound to our detection limits in any of the four galaxies. we find that the13co/12co ratios of three sauron galaxies are somewhat higher than those ingalaxies of different hubble types. the hcn/12co and hcn/13co ratios of allfour sauron galaxies resemble those of nearby seyfert and dwarf galaxies withnormal star formation rates, rather than those of starburst galaxies. thehcn/hco+ ratio is found to be relatively high (i.e., &gt;1) in the three saurongalaxies with detected hcn emission, mimicking the behaviour in otherstar-forming galaxies but being higher than in starburst galaxies. whencompared to most galaxies, it thus appears that 13co is enhanced (relative to12co) in three out of four sauron galaxies and hco+ is weak (relative to hcn)in three out of three galaxies.  all three galaxies detected in hcn follow the standard hcn-infraredluminosity and dense gas fraction-star formation efficiency correlations. asalready suggested by 12co observations, when traced by infrared radiation, starformation in the three sauron galaxies thus appears to follow the same physicallaws as in galaxies of different hubble types. the star formation rate andfraction of dense molecular gas however do not reach the high values found innearby starburst galaxies, but rather resemble those of nearby normalstar-forming galaxies.

1008.3183	the properties of the interstellar medium within a star-forming galaxy  at z=2.3	we present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in therest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3sub-millimetre galaxy smm j2135-0102. we obtain very high signal-to-noisedetections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20transitions from 9 species. we use the 12co, [ci] and hcn line strengths toinvestigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ism)chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitationmassive component. employing photo-dissociation region models we show that onaverage the molecular gas is exposed to a uv radiation field that is ~1000 xmore intense than the milky way, with star-forming regions having acharacteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. these conditions are similar to thosefound in local ulirgs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. the 12cospectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence thatthe system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray fluxwithin clouds. we show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas andstar-formation surface densities appear to follow the kennicutt-schmidtrelation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our datasuggest that this relation breaks down on scales of &lt;100pc. by virtue of thelens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on thestar formation and ism at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recentlybecome possible at z&lt;0.1, and show the potential physical properties that willbe studied in unlensed galaxies when alma is in full operation.

1010.3428	molecular gas properties of galaxies: the sma co(2-1) b0dega legacy  project	in the last two decades high resolution (&lt; 5 arcsec) co observations for ~150 galaxies have provided a wealth of information about the molecular gasmorphologies in the circumnuclear regions. while in samples of 'normal'galaxies the molecular gas does not seem to peak toward the nuclear regions forabout 50% of the galaxies, barred galaxies and mergers show largerconcentrations. however, we do not exactly know from an observational point ofview how the molecular gas properties of a galaxy evolve as a result of aninteraction. here we present the sma co(2-1) b0dega (below 0 degree galaxies)legacy project in which we are imaging the co(2-1) line of the circumnuclearregions (1 arcmin) of a large (~ 70) sample of nearby ir-bright spiralgalaxies, likely interacting, and that still remained unexplored due to itslocation in the southern hemisphere. we find different molecular gasmorphologies, such as rings, nuclear arms, nuclear bars and asymmetries. wefind a centrally peaked concentration in about 85% of the galaxies with typicalsize scales of about 0.5 - 1 kpc. this might be related to perturbationsproduced by recent interactions.

1012.3753	the submillimeter array 1.3 mm line survey of arp 220	we present the first aperture synthesis unbiased spectral line survey towardan extragalactic object. the survey covered the 40 ghz frequency range between202 and 242 ghz of the 1.3 mm atmospheric window. we find that 80% of theobserved band shows molecular emission, with 73 features identified from 15molecular species and 6 isotopologues. the 13c isotopic substitutions of hc3nand transitions from h2(18)o, 29sio, and ch2co are detected for the first timeoutside the galaxy. within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of thetotal measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with co onlycontributing 9% to the overall flux. we present maps of the co emission at aresolution of 2.9"x1.9" which, though not enough to resolve the two nuclei,recover all the single-dish flux. the 40 ghz spectral scan has been modelledassuming lte conditions and abundances are derived for all identified species.the chemical composition of arp 220 shows no clear evidence of an agn impact onthe molecular emission but seems indicative of a purely starburst-heated ism.the overabundance of h2s and the low isotopic ratios observed suggest achemically enriched environment by consecutive bursts of star formation, withan ongoing burst at an early evolutionary stage. the large abundance of water(~10^-5), derived from the isotopologue h2(18)o, as well as the vibrationallyexcited emission from hc3n and ch3cn are claimed to be evidence of massive starforming regions within arp 220. moreover, the observations put strongconstraints on the compactness of the starburst event in arp 220. we estimatethat such emission would require ~2-8x10^6 hot cores, similar to those found inthe sgr b2 region in the galactic center, concentrated within the central 700pc of arp 220.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

0710.4956	sma high angular resolution imaging of the lensed quasar apm08279+5255	we present submillimeter array observations of the z=3.91 gravitationallylensed broad absorption line quasar apm08279+5255 which spatially resolve the1.0mm (0.2mm rest-frame) dust continuum emission. at 0.4" resolution, theemission is separated into two components, a stronger, extended one to thenortheast (46+/-5mjy) and a weaker, compact one to the southwest (15+/-2mjy).we have carried out simulations of the gravitational lensing effect responsiblefor the two submm components in order to constrain the intrinsic size of thesubmm continuum emission. using an elliptical lens potential, the best fitlensing model yields an intrinsic (projected) diameter of ~80pc, which is notas compact as the optical/near-infrared (nir) emission and agrees with previoussize estimates of the gas and dust emission in apm08279+5255. based on ourestimate, we favor a scenario in which the 0.2mm (rest-frame) emissionoriginates from a warm dust component (t_d=150-220k) that is mainly heated bythe agn rather than by a starburst (sb). the flux is boosted by a factor of ~90in our model, consistent with recent estimates for apm08279+5255.

1205.4242	physical properties of dense molecular gas in centres of seyfert  galaxies	we present new ~1" resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central50-100 pc of four nearby seyfert galaxies. pdbi observations of hcn and, in 2of the 4 sources, simultaneously hco+ allow us to carefully constrain thedynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the agn. analysis of thekinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km/s fwhm that can only partiallyarise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. the observed morphologicaland kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and bluechannel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thickdisk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the diskradius). to put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and agnevolution, we estimate the toomre q parameter. we find this is always greaterthan the critical value, i.e. q is above the limit such that the gas is stableagainst rapid star formation. this is supported by the lack of direct evidence,in these 4 seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the agn.instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclearring. we conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to starformation within the central ~100 pc.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

0712.0319	a multi-transition hcn and hco+ study of 12 nearby active galaxies: agn  versus sb environments	recent studies have indicated that the hcn-to-co(j=1-0) andhco+-to-hcn(j=1-0) ratios are significantly different between galaxies with agn(active galactic nucleus) and sb (starburst) signatures. in order to study themolecular gas properties in active galaxies and search for differences betweenagn and sb environments, we observed the hcn(j=1-0), (j=2-1), (j=3-2),hco+(j=1-0) and hco+(j=3-2), emission with the iram 30m in the centre of 12nearby active galaxies which either exhibit nuclear sb and/or agn signatures.consistent with previous results, we find a significant difference of thehcn(j=2-1)-to-hcn(j=1-0), hcn(j=3-2)-to-hcn(j=1-0), hco+(j=3-2)-to-hco+(j=3-2),and hco+-to-hcn intensity ratios between the sources dominated by an agn andthose with an additional or pure central sb: the hcn, hco+ and hco+-to-hcnintensity ratios tend to be higher in the galaxies of our sample with a centralsb as opposed to the pure agn cases which show rather low intensity ratios.based on an lvg analysis of these data, i.e., assuming purely collisionalexcitation, the (average) molecular gas densities in the sb dominated sourcesof our sample seem to be systematically higher than in the agn sources. the lvganalysis seems to further support systematically higher hcn and/or lower hco+abundances as well as similar or higher gas temperatures in agn compared to thesb sources of our sample. also, we find that the hcn-to-co ratios decrease withincreasing rotational number j for the agn while they stay mostly constant forthe sb sources.

1403.0853	gas reservoir of a hyper-luminous qso at z=2.6	understanding the relationship between the formation and evolution ofgalaxies and their central super massive black holes (smbh) is one of the maintopics in extragalactic astrophysics. links and feedback may reciprocallyaffect both black hole and galaxy growth. observations of the co line atredshifts of 2-4 are crucial to investigate the gas mass, star formationactivity and accretion onto smbhs, as well as the effect of agn feedback.potential correlations between agn and host galaxy properties can behighlighted by observing extreme objects. despite their luminosity,hyper-luminous qsos at z=2-4 are still little studied at mm wavelengths. wetargeted co(3-2) in ulas j1539+0557, an hyper-luminos qso (lbol&gt; 10^48 erg/s)at z=2.658, selected through its unusual red colors in the ukidss large areasurvey (ulas). we find a molecular gas mass of 4.1+-0.8 10^10 msun, and a gasfraction of 0.4-0.1, depending mostly on the assumed source inclination. wealso find a robust lower limit to the star-formation rate (sfr=250-1600msun/yr) and star-formation efficiency (sfe=25-350 lsun/(k km s-1 pc2) bycomparing the observed optical-near-infrared spectral energy distribution withagn and galaxy templates. the black hole gas consumption timescale,m(h_2)/dm(accretion)/dt, is ~160 myr, similar or higher than the gasconsumption timescale. the gas content and the star formation efficiency aresimilar to those of other high-luminosity, highly obscured qsos, and at thelower end of the star-formation efficiency of unobscured qsos, in line withpredictions from agn-galaxy co-evolutionary scenarios. further measurements ofthe (sub)-mm continuum in this and similar sources are mandatory to obtain arobust observational picture of the agn evolutionary sequence.

1405.7706	molecular line emission in ngc1068 imaged with alma. i an agn-driven  outflow in the dense molecular gas	we investigate the fueling and the feedback of star formation and nuclearactivity in ngc1068, a nearby (d=14mpc) seyfert 2 barred galaxy, by analyzingthe distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the disk. we have usedalma to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (co(3-2),co(6-5), hcn(4-3), hco+(4-3) and cs(7-6)) and their underlying continuumemission in the central r ~ 2kpc of ngc1068 with spatial resolutions ~0.3"-0.5" (~ 20-35pc). molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detectedfrom a r ~ 200pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (cnd), from the2.6kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3kpc starburst (sb) ring. mostof the emission in hco+, hcn and cs stems from the cnd. molecular line ratiosshow dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the cnd that are correlatedwith the uv/x-ray illumination by the agn, betraying ongoing feedback. the gaskinematics from r ~ 50pc out to r ~ 400pc reveal a massive (m_mol ~ 2.7 (+0.9,-1.2) x 10^7 msun) outflow in all molecular tracers. the tight correlationbetween the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet and the occurrence of outwardmotions in the disk suggests that the outflow is agn-driven. the outflow rateestimated in the cnd, dm/dt ~ 63 (+21, -37) msun yr^-1, is an order ofmagnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming thatthe outflow is agn-driven. the power of the agn is able to account for theestimated momentum and kinetic luminosity of the outflow. the cnd mass loadrate of the cnd outflow implies a very short gas depletion time scale of &lt;=1myr.

1409.8158	co excitation of normal star forming galaxies out to z=1.5 as regulated  by the properties of their interstellar medium	we investigate the co excitation of normal star forming disk galaxies atz=1.5 using iram pdbi observations of the co[2-1], co[3-2] and co[5-4]transitions for 4 galaxies, including vla observations of co[1-0] for 3 ofthem, with the aim of constraining the average state of h2 gas. exploitingprior knowledge of the velocity range, spatial extent and size of the coemission we measure reliable line fluxes with s/n&gt;4-7 for individualtransitions. while the average co spectral line energy distribution (sled) hasa sub-thermal excitation similar to the milky way (mw) up to co[3-2], we showthat the average co[5-4] emission is four times stronger than assuming mwexcitation. this demonstrates the presence of an additional component of moreexcited, denser and possibly warmer molecular gas. the ratio of co[5-4] tolower-j co emission is lower than in local (u)lirgs and high-redshift smgs,correlating closely with the average intensity of the radiation field &lt;u&gt; andwith the star formation surface density, but not with the sf efficiency (sfe).the co[5-4] luminosity correlates linearly with lir over 4 orders ofmagnitudes, with z=1.5 bzk galaxies following the same trend as local spiralsand (u)lirgs and high redshift star bursting smgs. the co[5-4] luminosity isthus empirically related to the dense gas, and might be a more convenient wayto probe it than standard high--density tracers that are much fainter than co.we see excitation variations among our sample galaxies, that can be linked totheir evolutionary state and clumpiness in optical rest frame images. in onegalaxy we see spatially resolved excitation variations, where the more highlyexcited part of the galaxy corresponds to the location of massive sf clumps.this supports to models that suggest that giant clumps are the main source ofthe high excitation co emission in high redshift disk-like galaxies.

1412.1091	stellar feedback as the origin of an extended molecular outflow in a  starburst galaxy	recent observations have revealed that starburst galaxies can drive moleculargas outflows through stellar radiation pressure. molecular gas is the phase ofthe interstellar medium from which stars form, so these outflows curtailstellar mass growth in galaxies. previously known outflows, however, involvesmall fractions of the total molecular gas content and are restricted tosub-kiloparsec scales. it is also apparent that input from active galacticnuclei is in at least some cases dynamically important, so pure stellarfeedback has been considered incapable of aggressively terminating starformation on galactic scales. extraplanar molecular gas has been detected inthe archetype starburst galaxy m82, but so far there has been no evidence thatstarbursts can propel significant quantities of cold molecular gas to the samegalactocentric radius (~10 kpc) as the warmer gas traced by metal absorbers.here we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100pc) massive starburst galaxy at z=0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflowof ionized gas. we find that 35 per cent of the total molecular gas isspatially extended on a scale of approximately 10 kpc, and one third of thishas a velocity of up to 1000 km/s. the kinetic energy associated with thishigh-velocity component is consistent with the momentum flux available fromstellar radiation pressure. this result demonstrates that nuclear bursts ofstar formation are capable of ejecting large amounts of cold gas from thecentral regions of galaxies, thereby strongly affecting their evolution.

1502.05395	the chemical footprint of the star formation feedback in m 82 on scales  of 100 pc	we present interferometric observations of the cn 1-0 (113.491 ghz), n2h+ 1-0(93.173 ghz), h(41)a (92.034 ghz), ch3cn (91.987 ghz), cs 3-2 (146.969 ghz),c-c3h2 3-2 (145.089 ghz), h2co 2-1 (145.603 ghz) and hc3n 16-15 (145.601 ghz)lines towards m82, carried out with the iram plateau de bure interferometer(pdbi). pdr chemical modelling is used to interpret these observations.  our results show that the abundances of n2h+, cs and h13 co+ remain quiteconstant across the galaxy confirming that these species are excellent tracersof the dense molecular gas. on the contrary, the abundance of cn increases by afactor of 3 in the inner x2 bar orbits. the [cn]/[n2 h+ ] ratio is wellcorrelated with the h(41)a emission at all spatial scales down to 100 pc.chemical modelling shows that the variations in the [cn]/[n2h+] ratio can beexplained as the consequence of differences in the local intestellar uv fieldand in the average cloud sizes within the nucleus of the galaxy.  our high-spatial resolution imaging of the starburst galaxy m 82 shows thatthe star formation activity has a strong impact on the chemistry of themolecular gas. in particular, the entire nucleus behaves as a giantphoton-dominated region (pdr) whose chemistry is determined by the local uvflux. the detection of n2h+ shows the existence of a population of clouds withav &gt;20 mag all across the galaxy plane. these clouds constitute the moleculargas reservoir for the formation of new stars and, although distributed allalong the nucleus, the highest concentration occurs in the outer x1 bar orbits(r = 280 pc).

0804.4649	structure analysis of interstellar clouds: i. improving the  delta-variance method	the delta-variance analysis, has proven to be an efficient and accuratemethod of characterising the power spectrum of interstellar turbulence. theimplementation presently in use, however, has several shortcomings.  we propose and test an improved delta-variance algorithm for two-dimensionaldata sets, which is applicable to maps with variable error bars and which canbe quickly computed in fourier space. we calibrate the spatial resolution ofthe delta-variance spectra.  the new delta-variance algorithm is based on an appropriate filtering of thedata in fourier space. it allows us to distinguish the influence of variablenoise from the actual small-scale structure in the maps and it helps fordealing with the boundary problem in non-periodic and/or irregularly boundedmaps. we try several wavelets and test their spatial sensitivity usingartificial maps with well known structure sizes.  it turns out that different wavelets show different strengths with respect todetecting characteristic structures and spectral indices, i.e. differentaspects of map structures. as a reasonable universal compromise for the optimumdelta-variance filter, we propose the mexican-hat filter with a ratio betweenthe diameters of the core and the annulus of 1.5.

(1999), 12co(2-1)emission was detected towards both the lensed images of q0957+561 with the iramplateau de bure interferometer (pdbi). in contrast to the optical spectra ofthe two images which support the idea that they are images of one and the sameobject, the co-spectra were surprisingly different: the southern image (namedco-b) shows a single blueshifted line whereas a double-peaked line profile witha blue- and a redshifted part appears towards the northern image (co-a). basedon the observations and on simulations with a gravitational lens program, weare tempted to argue that the line profile traces the presence of molecular gasof a disk in the host galaxy around the quasar. we have now new observationswith the pdbi providing the necessary sensitivity to corroborate our diskmodel.

0810.0168	coordinated multi-wavelength observations of sgr a*	we report on recent near-infrared (nir) and x-ray observations of sagittariusa* (sgr a*), the electromagnetic manifestation of the ~4x10^6 solar massessuper-massive black hole (smbh) at the galactic center. the goal of thesecoordinated multi-wavelength observations is to investigate the variableemission from sgr a* in order to obtain a better understanding of theunderlying physical processes in the accretion flow/outflow. the observationshave been carried out using the naco adaptive optics (ao) instrument at theeuropean southern observatory's very large telescope (july 2005, may 2007) andthe acis-i instrument aboard the chandra x-ray observatory (july 2005). wereport on a polarized nir flare synchronous to a 8x1033 erg/s x-ray flare injuly 2005, and a further flare in may 2007 that shows the highest sub-flare toflare contrast observed until now. the observations can be interpreted in theframework of a model involving a temporary disk with a short jet. in the diskcomponent flux density variations can be explained due to hot spots onrelativistic orbits around the central smbh. the variations of thesub-structures of the may 2007 flare are interpreted as a variation of the hotspot structure due to differential rotation within the disk.

0810.4892	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga). xi. a complete gravity  torque map of ngc4579: new clues on bar evolution	we create a complete gravity torque map of the disk of the liner/seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc4579. we quantify the efficiency of angular momentum transport andsearch for signatures of secular evolution in the fueling process from r~15kpcdown to the inner r~50pc around the active galactic nucleus (agn). we use boththe 1-0 and 2-1 line maps of co obtained with the plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) as part of the nuclei of galaxies-(nuga)-project. wederive the stellar potential from a nir (k band) wide field image of thegalaxy. the k-band image, which reveals a stellar bar, together with a highresolution hi map of ngc4579 obtained with the very large array (vla), allow usto extend the gravity torque analysis to the outer disk. the bulk of the gasresponse traced by the co pdbi maps follows the expected gas flow patterninduced by the bar potential in the presence of two inner lindblad resonances(ilr). we also detect an oval distortion in the inner r~200pc of the k-bandimage. the oval is not aligned with the large-scale bar, a signature ofdynamical decoupling. the morphology of the outer disk suggests that theneutral gas is currently piling up in a pseudo-ring formed by two windingspiral arms that are morphologically decoupled from the bar structure. in theouter disk, the decoupling of the spiral allows the gas to efficiently producenet gas inflow on intermediate scales. the corotation barrier seems to beovercome due to secular evolution processes. the gas in the inner disk isefficiently funneled by gravity torques down to r~300pc. closer to the agn, thetwo m=2 modes (bar and oval) act in concert to produce net gas inflow down tor~50pc, providing a clear smoking gun evidence of fueling with associated shortdynamical time-scales.
