0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

0707.1561	the reionization and galaxy evolution probed by z=7 lyman alpha emitters	we made a narrowband nb973 (bandwidth of 200a at 9755a) imaging of the subarudeep field (sdf) and found two z=7 lyman alpha emitter (lae) candidates down tonb973=24.9. carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy, we identified one of themas a real z=6.96 lae. this has shown that galaxy formation was in progress just750 myr after the big bang. meanwhile, the lyman alpha line luminosity functionof lae is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the sdf. l* at z=6.6 is 40-60%of that at z=5.7. we also confirm that the number density of z=7 lae is only17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples. this seriesof significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be theresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. however, using the uv continuumluminosity functions of laes, those of lyman break galaxies, and a laeevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxyevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. this extra densitydeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the lyman alpha photons fromlaes due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoingcosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.

0911.2544	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z = 3 - 4 based on deep  large area surveys in the subaru-sxds/ukidss-uds field	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=3.1 and 3.7 in 0.65 deg^2 of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field, based onrest-frame uv-to-optical photometry obtained from the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey, the ukidss/ultra deep survey, and the spitzer legacy survey of theukidss/uds. among a total of 302 laes (224 for z=3.1 and 78 for z=3.7), only 11are detected in the k band, i.e., brighter than k(3sigma)=24.1 mag. eight ofthe 11 k-detected laes are spectroscopically confirmed. we find that thek-undetected objects, which should closely represent the lae population as awhole, have low stellar masses of ~ 10^8 - 10^8.5 msun, modest sfrs of 1 - 100msun yr^-1, and modest dust extinction of e(b-v) &lt; 0.2. the k-detected objectsare massive, mstar ~ 10^9 - 10^10.5 msun, and have significant dust extinctionwith a median of e(b-v) ~= 0.3. four k-detected objects with the reddestspectral energy distributions, two of which are spectroscopically confirmed,are heavily obscured with e(b-v) ~ 0.65, and their continua resemble those ofsome local ulirgs. interestingly, they have large lyman alpha equivalent widths~= 70 - 250 a. if these four are excluded, our sample has a weakanti-correlation between ew(lya) and mstar. we compare the stellar masses andthe specific star formation rates (ssfr) of laes with those of lyman-breakgalaxies, distant red galaxies, submillimetre galaxies, and i- or k-selectedgalaxies with z_phot ~ 3. we find that the lae population is the least massiveamong all the galaxy populations in question, but with relatively high ssfrs,while nir-detected laes have mstar and ssfr similar to lbgs. our reddest fourlaes have very high ssfrs in spite of large mstar, thus occupying a uniqueregion in the mstar versus ssfr space.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1003.5244	keck spectroscopy of faint 3&lt;z&lt;7 lyman break galaxies: - i. new  constraints on cosmic reionisation from the luminosity and redshift-dependent  fraction of lyman-alpha emission	we present results from a new keck spectroscopic survey of uv-faint lbgs inthe redshift range 3&lt;z&lt;7. combined with earlier keck and published eso vltdata, our sample contains more than 600 dropouts, offering new insight into thenature of sub-l* sources typical of those likely to dominate the cosmicreionisation process. here we use this sample to characterise the fraction ofstrong lya emitters within the continuum-selected dropouts. by quantifying howthe "lya fraction" varies with redshift, we seek to constrain changes in lyatransmission associated with reionisation. in order to distinguish the effectsof reionisation from other factors which affect the lya fraction (e.g. dust,ism kinematics), we study the luminosity and redshift-dependence of the lyafraction over 3&lt;z&lt;6, when the igm is known to be ionised. these results revealthat low luminosity galaxies show strong lya emission much more frequently thanluminous systems, and that at fixed luminosity, the prevalence of strong lyaemission increases moderately with redshift over 3 &lt; z &lt; 6. based on thecorrelation between blue uv slopes and strong lya emitting galaxies in ourdataset, we argue that the lya fraction trends are governed by redshift andluminosity-dependent variations in the dust obscuration, with likely additionalcontributions from trends in the kinematics and covering fraction of neutralhydrogen. we find a tentative decrease in the lya fraction at z~7 based on thelimited ir spectra for candidate z~7 lensed lbgs, a result which, if confirmedwith future surveys, would suggest an increase in the neutral fraction by thisepoch. given the supply of z and y-drops now available from hubble wfc3/irsurveys, we show it will soon be possible to significantly improve estimates ofthe lya fraction using optical and near-ir spectrographs, thereby extending thestudy conducted in this paper to 7&lt;z&lt;8.

1004.0963	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z~6-7: constraints on the  escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxy building blocks	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=5.7 and 6.6 in a 0.65 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds)field, using deep images taken with subaru/suprime-cam, ukirt/wfcam, andspitzer/irac. we produce stacked multiband images at each redshift from 165(z=5.7) and 91 (z=6.6) irac-undetected objects, to derive typical spectralenergy distributions (seds) of z~6-7 laes for the first time. the stacked laeshave as blue uv continua as the hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies of similar muv,with a spectral slope beta ~ -3, but at the same time they have reduv-to-optical colors with detection in the 3.6um band. using sed fitting wefind that the stacked laes have low stellar masses of ~(3-10)*10^7 msun, veryyoung ages of ~1-3 myr, negligible dust extinction, and strong nebular emissionfrom the ionized interstellar medium, although the z=6.6 object is fittedsimilarly well with high-mass models without nebular emission; inclusion ofnebular emission reproduces the red uv-to-optical color while keeping the uvcolor sufficiently blue. we infer that typical laes at z~6-7 are buildingblocks of galaxies seen at lower redshifts. we find a tentative decrease in thelyman alpha escape fraction from z=5.7 to 6.6, which may imply an increase inthe intergalactic medium neutral fraction. from the minimum contribution ofnebular emission required to fit the observed seds, we place an upper limit onthe escape fraction of ionizing photons to be f_esc^ion~0.6 at z=5.7 and ~0.9at z=6.6. we also compare the stellar populations of our laes with that ofstacked hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1008.4842	lyman alpha emitters at z=7 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field:  photometric candidates and luminosity function	we conducted a deep narrowband nb973 (fwhm = 200 a centered at 9755 a) surveyof z=7 lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field,using the fully depleted ccds newly installed on the subaru telescopesuprime-cam, which is twice more sensitive to z=7 lyman alpha at ~ 1 micronthan the previous ccds. reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than ourprevious survey in the subaru deep field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96lae, we detected three probable z=7 lae candidates. even if all the candidatesare real, the lyman alpha luminosity function (lf) at z=7 shows a significantdeficit from the lf at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. the lae number andlyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those atz=5.7 to the lyman alpha line luminosity limit of l(ly-alpha) &gt;~ 9.2 x 10^{42}erg s^{-1}. this could be due to evolution of the lae population at theseepochs as a recent galaxy evolution model predicts that the lae modestlyevolves from z=5.7 to 7. however, even after correcting for this effect ofgalaxy evolution on the decrease in lae number density, the z=7 lyman alpha lfstill shows a deficit from z=5.7 lf. this might reflect the attenuation oflyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionizationand suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet atz=7. if we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalacticmedium (igm) transmission for lyman alpha photons at z=7 would be 0.4 &lt;=t_{ly-alpha}^{igm} &lt;= 1, supporting the possible higher neutral fraction at theearlier epochs at z &gt; 6 suggested by the previous surveys of z=5.7-7 laes, z ~6 quasars and z &gt; 6 gamma-ray bursts.

1009.3377	moircs deep survey. vii: nir morphologies of star-forming galaxies at  redshift z~1	we investigate rest-frame near-infrared (nir) morphologies of a sample of 139galaxies with m_{s} &gt;= 1 x 10^{10} m_{sun} at z=0.8-1.2 in the goods-northfield using our deep nir imaging data (moircs deep survey, mods). we focus onluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs), which dominate high star formation rate(sfr) density at z~1, in the sample identified by cross-correlating with thespitzer/mips 24um source catalog. we perform two-dimensional light profilefitting of the z~1 galaxies in the ks-band (rest-frame j-band) with a singlecomponent sersic model. we find that at z~1, ~90% of lirgs have low sersicindices (n&lt;2.5, similar to disk-like galaxies) in the ks-band, and thosedisk-like lirgs consist of ~60% of the whole disk-like sample above m_{s} &gt;= 3x 10^{10} m_{sun}. the z~1 disk-like lirgs are comparable or ~20% small at amaximum in size compared to local disk-like galaxies in the same stellar massrange. if we examine rest-frame uv-optical morphologies using the hst/acsimages, the rest-frame b-band sizes of the z~1 disk-like galaxies arecomparable to those of the local disk-like galaxies as reported by previousstudies on size evolution of disk-like galaxies in the rest-frame optical band.measuring color gradients (galaxy sizes as a function of wavelength) of the z~1and local disk-like galaxies, we find that the z~1 disk-like galaxies have 3-5times steeper color gradient than the local ones. our results indicate that (i)more than a half of relatively massive disk-like galaxies at z~1 are in violentstar formation epochs observed as lirgs, and also (ii) most of those lirgs areconstructing their fundamental disk structure vigorously. the high sfr densityin the universe at z~1 may be dominated by such star formation in disk regionin massive galaxies.

1009.5471	keck spectroscopy of faint 3&lt;z&lt;7 lyman break galaxies:- ii. a high  fraction of line emitters at redshift six	as lyman-alpha photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen, a change withredshift in the lyman-alpha equivalent width distribution of distant galaxiesoffers a promising probe of the degree of ionization in the intergalacticmedium and hence when cosmic reionization ended. this simple test iscomplicated by the fact that lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by theevolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. in the first paper in thisseries, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in thefraction of lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) over the range 3&lt;z&lt;6; lower luminosity galaxies and those athigher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. here wepresent the results from much deeper 12.5 hour exposures with the keck deimosspectrograph focused primarily on lbgs at z~6 which enable us to confirm theredshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift thanwas hitherto possible. we find 54+/-11% of faint z~6 lbgs show strong (w_0&gt;25a) emission, an increase of 1.6x from a similar sample observed at z~4. with atotal sample of 74 z~6 lbgs, we determine the luminosity-dependent lyman-alphaequivalent width distribution. assuming continuity in these trends to the newpopulation of z~7 sources located with the hubble wfc3/ir camera, we predictthat unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 myr, the successrate for spectroscopic confirmation using lyman-alpha emission should be high.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1105.2824	average metallicity and star formation rate of lya emitters probed by a  triple narrow-band survey	we present the average metallicity and star-formation rate of lya emitters(laes) measured from our large-area survey with three narrow-band (nb) filterscovering the lya, [oii]3727, and ha+[nii] lines of laes at z=2.2. we select 919z=2.2 laes from subaru/suprime-cam nb data in conjunction with magellan/imacsspectroscopy. of these laes, 561 and 105 are observed with kpno/newfirmnear-infrared nb filters whose central wavelengths are matched to redshifted[oii] and ha nebular lines, respectively. by stacking the near-infrared imagesof the laes, we successfully obtain average nebular-line fluxes of laes, themajority of which are too faint to be identified individually by narrow-bandimaging or deep spectroscopy. the stacked object has an ha luminosity of1.7x10^{42} erg s^{-1} corresponding to a star formation rate (sfr) of 14m_{sun} yr^{-1}. we place, for the first time, a firm lower limit to theaverage metallicity of laes of z&gt;~0.09 z_{sun} (2sigma) based on the[oii]/(ha+[nii]) index together with photo-ionization models and empiricalrelations. this lower limit of metallicity rules out the hypothesis that laes,so far observed at z~2, are extremely metal poor (z&lt;2x10^{-2} z_{sun}) younggalaxies at the 4sigma level. this limit is higher than a simple extrapolationof the observed mass-metallicity relation of z~2 uv-selected galaxies towardlower masses (5x10^{8} m_{sun}), but roughly consistent with a recentlyproposed fundamental mass-metallicity relation when the laes' relatively lowsfr is taken into account. the ha and lya luminosities of our nb-selected laesindicate that the escape fraction of lya photons is ~12-30 %, much higher thanthe values derived for other galaxy populations at z~2.

1107.3159	spectroscopic confirmation of three z-dropout galaxies at z = 6.844 -  7.213: demographics of lyman-alpha emission in z ~ 7 galaxies	we present the results of our ultra-deep keck/deimos spectroscopy ofz-dropout galaxies in the sdf and goods-n. for 3 out of 11 objects, we detectan emission line at ~ 1um with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 10. the lines showasymmetric profiles with high weighted skewness values, consistent with beinglya, yielding redshifts of z=7.213, 6.965, and 6.844. specifically, we confirmthe z=7.213 object in two independent deimos runs with different spectroscopicconfigurations. the z=6.965 object is a known lya emitter, iok-1, for which ourimproved spectrum at a higher resolution yields a robust skewness measurement.the three z-dropouts have lya fluxes of 3 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 andrest-frame equivalent widths ew_0^lya = 33-43a. based on the largestspectroscopic sample of 43 z-dropouts that is the combination of our andprevious data, we find that the fraction of lya-emitting galaxies (ew_0^lya &gt;25a) is low at z ~ 7; 17 +- 10% and 24 +- 12% for bright (muv ~= -21) and faint(muv ~= -19.5) galaxies, respectively. the fractions of lya-emitting galaxiesdrop from z ~ 6 to 7 and the amplitude of the drop is larger for faint galaxiesthan for bright galaxies. these two pieces of evidence would indicate that theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm increases from z ~ 6 to 7, and that thereionization proceeds from high- to low-density environments, as suggested byan inside-out reionization model.

1112.3997	the first systematic survey for lyman alpha emitters at z=7.3 with  red-sensitive subaru/suprime-cam	we have performed deep imaging surveys for lya emitters (laes) at redshift~7.3 in two blank fields, the subaru deep field (sdf) and the subaru/xmm-newtondeep survey field (sxdf), using the subaru/suprime-cam equipped with newred-sensitive ccds and a new narrow-band filter, nb1006 (lambda_c=10052 ang,fwhm=214 ang). we identified four objects as lae candidates that exhibitluminosity excess in nb1006. by carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy forthree of them using subaru/focas and keck/deimos, a definitively asymmetricemission line is detected for one of them, sxdf-nb1006-2. assuming this line islya, this object is a lae at z=7.215 which has luminosity of 1.2^{+1.5}_{-0.6}x 10^43 [erg s-1] and a weighted skewness s_w=4.90+-0.86. another object,sdf-nb1006-2, shows variable photometry and is thus probably a quasar (qso) oran active galactic nucleus (agn). it shows an asymmetric emission line at 10076ang, which may be due to either lya at z=7.288 or [oii] at z=1.703. the thirdobject, sdf-nb1006-1, is likely a galaxy with temporal luminosity enhancementassociated with a supernova explosion, as the brightness of this object variesbetween the observed epochs. its spectrum does not show any emission lines. theinferred decrease in the number density of laes toward higher redshift isn_lya(z=7.3)/n_lya(z=5.7) = 0.05^+0.11_-0.05 from z=5.7 to 7.3 down tol(lya)=1.0 x 10^43 [erg s-1]. the present result is consistent with theinterpretation in previous studies that the neutral hydrogen fraction israpidly increasing from z=5.7 to 7.3.

1206.2316	gas motion study of lya emitters at z~2 using uv and optical spectral  lines	we present the results of magellan/mmirs and keck/nirspec spectroscopy forfive lya emitters (laes) at z=2.2 for which high-resolution fuv spectra frommagellan/mage are available. we detect nebular emission lines including ha onthe individual basis and low-ionization interstellar (lis) absorption lines ina stacked fuv spectrum, and measure average offset velocities of the lya line,delta_v_lya, and lis absorption lines, delta_v_abs, with respect to thesystemic velocity defined by the nebular lines. for a sample of eight z~2-3laes without agn from our study and the literature, we obtain delta_v_lya =175+/-35 km s^{-1}, which is significantly smaller than that of lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs), delta_v_lya=400 km s^{-1}. the stacked fuv spectrum givesdelta_v_abs = -179 +/- 73 km s^{-1}, comparable to that of lbgs. these positivedelta_v_lya and negative delta_v_abs suggest that laes also have outflows. incontrast to lbgs, however, the laes' delta_v_lya is as small as |delta_v_abs|,suggesting low neutral hydrogen column densities. such a low column densitywith a small number of resonant scattering may cause the observed strong lyaemission of laes. we find an anti-correlation between lya equivalent width (ew)and delta_v_lya in a compilation of lae and lbg samples. although its physicalorigin is not clear, this anti-correlation result appears to challenge thehypothesis that a strong outflow, by means of a reduced number of resonantscattering, produces a large ew. if laes at z&gt;6 have similarly smalldelta_v_lya values, constraints on the reionization history derived from thelya transmissivity may need to be revised.

1207.5479	nebular attenuation in h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies at z=0.8  from the newh\alpha\ survey	we present measurements of the dust attenuation of h\alpha-selectedemission-line galaxies at z=0.8 from the newh\alpha\ narrowband survey. theanalysis is based on deep follow-up spectroscopy with magellan/imacs, whichcaptures the strong rest-frame optical emission lines from [oii] \lambda 3727to [oiii] \lambda 5007. the spectroscopic sample used in this analysis consistsof 341 confirmed h\alpha\ emitters. we place constraints on the agn fractionusing diagnostics which can be applied at intermediate redshift. we find thatat least 5% of the objects in our spectroscopic sample can be classified as agnand 2% are composite, i.e. powered by a combination of star-formation and agnactivity. we measure the dust attenuation for individual objects from theratios of the higher order balmer lines. the h\beta\ and h\gamma\ pair of linesis detected with s/n&gt;5 in 55 individual objects and the h\beta\ and h\delta\pair is detected in 50 individual objects. we also create stacked spectra toprobe the attenuation in objects without individual detections. the medianattenuation at h\alpha\ based on the objects with individually detected linesis a(h\alpha)=0.9+-1.0 magnitudes, in good agreement with the attenuation foundin local samples of star-forming galaxies. we find that the z=0.8 galaxiesoccupy a similar locus of attenuation as a function of magnitude, mass and sfras a comparison sample drawn from the sdss dr4. both the results from theindividual z=0.8 galaxies and from the stacked spectra show consistency withthe mass -- attenuation and sfr -- attenuation relations found in the localuniverse, indicating that these relations are also applicable at intermediateredshift.

1208.3260	first spectroscopic evidence for high ionization state and low oxygen  abundance in lya emitters	we present results from keck/nirspec and magellan/mmirs follow-upspectroscopy of lya emitters (laes) at z=2.2 identified in our subarunarrowband survey. we successfully detect ha emission from seven laes, andperform a detailed analysis of six laes free from agn activity, two out ofwhich, cdfs-3865 and cosmos-30679, have [oii] and [oiii] line detections. theyare the first [oii]-detected laes at high-z, and their [oiii]/[oii] ratios andr23-indices provide the first simultaneous determinations of ionizationparameter and oxygen abundance for laes. cdfs-3865 has a very high ionizationparameter (q_{ion}=2.5^{+1.7}_{-0.8}x10^8 cm s^{-1}) and a low oxygen abundance(12+log(o/h)=7.84^{+0.24}_{-0.25}) in contrast with moderate values of otherhigh-z galaxies such as lyman-break galaxies (lbgs). cosmos-30679 alsopossesses a relatively high ionization parameter (q_{ion}=8^{+10}_{-4}x10^7 cms^{-1}) and a low oxygen abundance (12+log(o/h)=8.18^{+0.28}_{-0.28}). bothlaes appear to fall below the mass-metallicity relation of z~2 lbgs. similarly,a low metallicity of 12+log(o/h)&lt;8.4 is independently indicated for typicallaes from a composite spectrum and the [nii]/ha index. such high ionizationparameters and low oxygen abundances can be found in local star-forminggalaxies, but this extreme local population occupies only ~0.06% of the sdssspectroscopic galaxy sample with a number density ~100 times smaller than thatof laes. with their high ionization parameters and low oxygen abundances, laeswould represent an early stage of galaxy formation dominated by massive starsin compact star-forming regions. high-q_{ion} galaxies like laes would produceionizing photons efficiently with a high escape fraction achieved bydensity-bounded hii regions, which would significantly contribute to cosmicreionization at z&gt;6.

1211.6804	the abundance of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 8.5 to 12:  new results from the 2012 hubble ultra deep field campaign	we present the results of the deepest search to date for star-forminggalaxies beyond a redshift z~8.5 utilizing a new sequence of near-infrared widefield camera 3 images of the hubble ultra deep field. this `udf12' campaigncompleted in september 2012 doubles the earlier exposures with wfc3/ir in thisfield and quadruples the exposure in the key f105w filter used to locate suchdistant galaxies. combined with additional imaging in the f140w filter, thefidelity of high redshift candidates is greatly improved. using spectral energydistribution fitting techniques on objects selected from a deep multi-bandnear-infrared stack we find 7 promising z&gt;8.5 candidates. as none of thepreviously claimed udf candidates with 8.5&lt;z&lt;10 is confirmed by our deepermulti-band imaging, our campaign has transformed the measured abundance ofgalaxies in this redshift range. although we recover the candidateudfj-39546284 (previously proposed at z=10.3), it is undetected in the newlyadded f140w image, implying it lies at z=11.9 or is an intense emission linegalaxy at z~2.4. although no physically-plausible model can explain therequired line intensity given the lack of lyman alpha or broad-band uv signal,without an infrared spectrum we cannot rule out an exotic interloper.regardless, our robust z ~ 8.5 - 10 sample demonstrates a luminosity densitythat continues the smooth decline observed over 6 &lt; z &lt; 8. such continuity hasimportant implications for models of cosmic reionization and future searchesfor z&gt;10 galaxies with jwst.

1212.3869	evolution of the sizes of galaxies over 7&lt;z&lt;12 revealed by the 2012  hubble ultra deep field campaign	we analyze the redshift- and luminosity-dependent sizes of dropout galaxycandidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the udf12campaign, data which offers two distinct advantages over that used in earlierwork. firstly, we utilize the increased s/n ratio offered by the udf12 imagingto provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in thehudf. specifically, we stack the new deep f140w image with the existing f125wdata in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii ofz-dropouts. similarly we stack this image with the new deep udf12 f160w imageto obtain new size measurements for a sample of y-dropouts. secondly, becausethe udf12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy samplein the hudf at z&gt;8, we have been able to extend the measurement of averagegalaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. restricting our sizemeasurements to sources which are now detected at &gt;15sigma, we confirm earlierindications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremelysmall, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations inlocal star-forming galaxies. we also confirm that there is a clear trend ofdecreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the firstevidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. modeling the evolution of theaverage half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index ofs=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physicallyexpected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)and constant velocity (s=-1.5). a clear size-luminosity relation, such as thatfound at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and y-dropout sample.this relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of starformation over a range in luminosity of 0.05-1.0l*_z=3.(abridged)

1212.4819	the uv luminosity function of star-forming galaxies via dropout  selection at redshifts z ~ 7 and 8 from the 2012 ultra deep field campaign	we present a catalog of high redshift star-forming galaxies selected to liewithin the redshift range z ~ 7-8 using the ultra deep field 2012 (udf12), thedeepest near-infrared (near-ir) exposures yet taken with the hubble spacetelescope. as a result of the increased near-infrared exposure time compared toprevious hst imaging in this field, we probe 0.65 (0.25) mag fainter inabsolute uv magnitude, at z ~ 7 (8), which increases confidence in ameasurement of the faint end slope of the galaxy luminosity function. through a0.7 mag deeper limit in the key f105w filter that encompasses or lies justlongward of the lyman break, we also achieve a much-refined color-colorselection that balances high redshift completeness and a low expectedcontamination fraction. we improve the number of drop-out selected udf sourcesto 47 at z ~ 7 and 27 at z ~ 8. incorporating brighter archival andground-based samples, we measure the z ~ 7 uv luminosity function to anabsolute magnitude limit of m_uv = -17 and find a faint end schechter slope of\alpha = -1.87+/- 0.18. using a similar color-color selection at z ~ 8 thattakes account of our newly-added imaging in the f140w filter, and incorporatingarchival data from the hippies and borg campaigns, we provide a robust estimateof the faint end slope at z ~ 8, \alpha = -1.94 +/- 0.23. we briefly discussour results in the context of earlier work and that derived using the sameudf12 data but with an independent photometric redshift technique (mclure et al2012).

1301.1228	new constraints on cosmic reionization from the 2012 hubble ultra deep  field campaign	understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification andcharacterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. the 2012 hubbleultra deep field (udf12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images withthe wide field camera 3 aboard hubble space telescope and, for the first time,systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) data indicates reionization was underway. the udf12campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance,luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forminggalaxies. we synthesize the new udf12 results with the most recent constraintsfrom cmb observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (uv) luminositydensities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depthevolution consistent with the available data. under reasonable assumptionsabout the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons and the intergalacticmedium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshiftz~6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z~7-9 likely mustextend in luminosity below the udf12 limits to absolute uv magnitudes ofm_uv\sim -13 or fainter. moreover, low levels of star formation extending toredshifts z~15-25, as suggested by the normal uv colors of z\simeq7-8 galaxiesand the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by udf12 toz\simeq10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth toelectron scattering inferred from cmb observations.

1303.0024	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6.  i. basic characteristics of the rest-frame uv continuum and lyman-alpha  emission	we present deep hst near-ir and spitzer mid-ir observations of a large sampleof spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6. the sample consists of 51lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) at 5.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5. the near-ir images were mostly obtained withwfc3 in the f125w and f160w bands, and the mid-ir images were obtained withirac in the 3.6um and 4.5um bands. our galaxies also have deep optical imagingdata from subaru suprime-cam. we utilize the multi-band data and secureredshifts to derive their rest-frame uv properties. these galaxies have steepuv continuum slopes roughly between beta ~ -1.5 and -3.5, with an average valueof beta ~ -2.3, slightly steeper than the slopes of lbgs in previous studies.the slope shows little dependence on uv continuum luminosity except for a fewof the brightest galaxies. we find a statistically significant excess ofgalaxies with slopes around beta ~ -3, suggesting the existence of very youngstellar populations with extremely low metallicity and dust content. ourgalaxies have moderately strong rest-frame lyman-alpha equivalent width (ew) ina range of ~10 to ~200 \aa. the star-formation rates are also moderate, from afew to a few tens solar masses per year. the laes and lbgs in this sample sharemany common properties, implying that laes represent a subset of lbgs withstrong lyman-alpha emission. finally, the comparison of the uv luminosityfunctions between laes and lbgs suggests that there exists a substantialpopulation of faint galaxies with weak lyman-alpha emission (ew &lt; 20 \aa) thatcould be the dominant contribution to the total ionizing flux at z &gt;= 6.

1305.1305	evolution of star formation in the ukidss ultra deep survey field - i.  luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate out to z=1.6	we present new results on the cosmic star formation history in the sxds-udsfield out to z=1.6. we compile narrow-band data from the subaru telescope andthe visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) in conjunctionwith broad-band data from the sxds and uds, to make a selection of 5725emission-line galaxies in 12 redshift slices, spanning 10 gyr of cosmic time.we determine photometric redshifts for the sample using 11-band photometry, anduse a spectroscopically confirmed subset to fine tune the resultant redshiftdistribution. we use the maximum-likelihood technique to determine luminosityfunctions in each redshift slice and model the selection effects inherent inany narrow-band selection statistically, to obviate the retrospectivecorrections ordinarily required. the deep narrow-band data are sensitive tovery low star formation rates (sfrs), and allow an accurate evaluation of thefaint end slope of the schechter function, alpha. we find that alpha isparticularly sensitive to the assumed faintest broadband magnitude of a galaxycapable of hosting an emission line, and propose that this limit should beempirically motivated. for this analysis we base our threshold on the limitingobserved equivalent widths of emission lines in the local universe. we computethe characteristic sfr of galaxies in each redshift slice, and the integratedsfr density, rho_{sfr}. we find our results to be in good agreement with theliterature and parametrize the evolution of the sfr density as rho_{sfr}proportional to (1 + z)^{4.58} confirming a steep decline in star formationactivity since z = 1.6.

1306.6642	the galaxy environment of a qso at z ~ 5.7	high-redshift quasars are believed to reside in massive halos in the earlyuniverse and should therefore be located in fields with overdensities ofgalaxies, which are thought to evolve into galaxy clusters seen in the localuniverse. however, despite many efforts, the relationship between galaxyoverdensities and z~6 quasars is ambiguous. this can possibly be attributed tothe difficulty of finding galaxies with accurate redshifts in the vicinity ofz~6 quasars. so far, overdensity searches around z~6 quasars have been based onstudies of lyman break galaxies (lbgs), which probe a redshift range of delta z~ 1. this range is large enough to select galaxies that may not be physicallyrelated to the quasar. we use deep narrow- and broadband imaging to study theenvironment of the z=5.72 quasar ulas j0203+0012. the redshift range probed byour narrow-band selection of lyman alpha emitters (laes) is delta z ~ 0.1,which is significantly narrower than the lbg searches. this is the first timethat laes were searched for near a z~6 quasar, in an effort to provide cluesabout the environments of quasars at the end of the epoch of reionization. wefind no enhancement of laes in the surroundings of ulas j0203+0012 incomparison with blank fields. we explore different explanations andinterpretations for this non-detection of a galaxy overdensity, including that(1) the strong ionization from the quasar may prevent galaxy formation in itsimmediate vicinity and (2) high-redshift quasars may not reside in the centerof the most massive dark matter halos.

1309.0207	ionization state of inter-stellar medium in galaxies: evolution,  sfr-m_star-z dependence, and ionizing photon escape	we present a systematic study for ionization state of inter-stellar medium ingalaxies at z=0-3 with ~140,000 sdss galaxies and 108 intermediate to highredshift galaxies from the literature, using an ionization-parameter sensitiveline ratio of [oiii]5007/[oii]3727 and photoionization models. we confirm thatz=2-3 galaxies show an [oiii]/[oii] ratio significantly higher than a typicalstar-forming galaxy of sdss by a factor of &gt;~10, and the photoionization modelsreveal that these high-z galaxies have an ionization parameter of log(qion/cms^{-1})~7.6-9.0, a factor of ~4-10 higher than local galaxies. for galaxies atany redshift, we identify a correlation between the [oiii]/[oii] ratio andgalaxy global properties of star-formation rate (sfr), stellar mass (m_star),and metallicity (z). we extend the fundamental metallicity relation (fmr) anddevelop the fundamental ionization relation (fir), a four-dimensional relationof ionization parameter, sfr, m_star, and z. the intermediate and high-zgalaxies up to z~3 follow the fir defined with the local galaxies, in contrastwith the fmr whose possible evolution from z~2 to 3 is reported. we find thatthe fmr evolution of z~2-3 appears, if one omits ionization parameterdifferences, and that the fmr evolution does not exist for an averagemetallicity solution of z~3 galaxies with a high-ionization parameter.interestingly, all of two local lyman-continuum emitting galaxies (lyc leakers)have a high [oiii]/[oii] ratio, indicating a positive correlation between[oiii]/[oii] and ionizing photon escape fraction (fesc), which is successfullyexplained by our photoionization models. because [oiii]/[oii] ratios of z~2-3galaxies, especially ly-alpha emitters (laes), are comparable to, or higherthan, those of the local lyc leakers, these high-z galaxies are candidates oflyman-continuum emitting objects.

0801.4827	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) -vii. clustering segregation  with ultraviolet and optical luminosities of lyman-break galaxies at z~3	we investigate clustering properties of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3based on deep multi-waveband imaging data from optical to near-infraredwavelengths in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field. the lbgs are selected by u-vand v-z' colors in one contiguous area of 561 arcmin^2 down to z'=25.5. westudy the dependence of the clustering strength on rest-frame uv and opticalmagnitudes, which can be indicators of star formation rate and stellar mass,respectively. the correlation length is found to be a strong function of bothuv and optical magnitudes with brighter galaxies being more clustered thanfaint ones in both cases. furthermore, the correlation length is dependent on acombination of uv and optical magnitudes in the sense that galaxies bright inoptical magnitude have large correlation lengths irrespective of uv magnitude,while galaxies faint in optical magnitude have correlation lengths decreasingwith decreasing uv brightness. these results suggest that galaxies with largestellar masses always belong to massive halos in which they can have variousstar formation rates, while galaxies with small stellar masses reside in lessmassive halos only if they have low star formation rates. there appears to bean upper limit to the stellar mass and the star formation rate which isdetermined by the mass of hosting dark halos.

0802.0228	lyman-alpha emitters and lyman-break galaxies at z=3-6 in cosmological  sph simulations	we study the properties of lyman-alpha emitters (laes) and lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) at z=3-6 using cosmological sph simulations. we investigate twosimple scenarios for explaining the observed ly-a and rest-frame uv luminosityfunctions (lfs) of laes: (i) the "escape fraction" scenario, in which the"effective" escape fraction (including the igm attenuation) of ly-a photons isf_lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the "stochastic" scenario, in which thefraction of laes that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) aftercorrecting for the igm attenuation. our comparisons with a number of differentobservations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escapefraction scenario. we find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicityand black hole mass hosted by laes are all smaller in the stochastic scenariothan in the escape fraction scenario. in our simulations, the galaxy stellarmass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation.however, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in thespecific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frameuv lf from z=6 to 3. the rest-frame uv lf of both laes and lbgs at z=3 &amp; 6 canbe described well by the stochastic scenario provided the extinction ismoderate, e(b-v) ~0.15, for both populations, although our simulation might beoverpredicting the number of bright lbgs at z=6. we also discuss thecorrelation function and bias of laes. the ly-a lfs at z=6 in a field-of-viewof 0.2 deg^2 show a significantly larger scatter owing to cosmic variancerelative to that in a 1 deg^2 field, and the scatter seen in the currentobservational estimates of the ly-a lf can be accounted for by cosmic variance.

1401.1209	what is the physical origin of strong lya emission? i. demographics of  lya emitter structures	we present the results of structure analyses for a large sample of 426 lyaemitters (laes) at z~2.2 that are observed with hst/acs and wfc3-ir by deepextra-galactic legacy surveys. we confirm that the merger fraction and theaverage ellipticity of lae's stellar component are 10-30 % and 0.4-0.6,respectively, that are comparable with previous study results. we successfullyidentify that some laes have a spatial offset between lya and stellar-continuumemission peaks, d_lya, by ~2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical errors. to uncoverthe physical origin of strong lya emission found in laes, we investigate lyaequivalent width (ew) dependences of these three structural parameters, mergerfraction, d_lya, and ellipticity of stellar distribution in the range ofew(lya)=20-250a. contrary to expectations, we find that merger fraction doesnot significantly increase with lya ew. we reveal an anti-correlation betweend_lya and ew(lya) by kolmogorov-smirnov (ks) test. there is a trend that thelaes with a large lya ew have a small ellipticity. this is consistent with therecent theoretical claims that lya photons can more easily escape from face-ondisks having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar gas along the lineof sight, although our ks test indicates that this trend is not statisticallysignificant. our results of lya-ew dependence generally support the idea thatan hi column density is a key quantity determining lya emissivity.

1402.1168	what is the physical origin of strong lya emission? ii. gas kinematics  and distribution of lya emitters	we present a statistical study of velocities of lya, interstellar (is)absorption, and nebular lines and gas covering fraction for lya emitters (laes)at z~2. we make a sample of 22 laes with a large lya equivalent width (ew) of &gt;50a based on our deep keck/lris observations, in conjunction with spectroscopicdata from the subaru/fmos program and the literature. we estimate the averagevelocity offset of lya from a systemic redshift determined with nebular linesto be dv_lya=234+-9 km s-1. using a kolmogorv-smirnov test, we confirm theprevious claim of hashimoto et al. (2013) that the average dv_lya of laes issmaller than that of lbgs. our lris data successfully identify blue-shiftedmultiple is absorption lines in the uv continua of four laes on an individualbasis. the average velocity offset of is absorption lines from a systemicredshift is dv_is=204+-27 km s-1, indicating lae's gas outflow with a velocitycomparable to typical lbgs. thus, the ratio, r^lya_ is = dv_lya/dv_is of laes,is around unity, suggestive of low impacts on lya transmission by resonantscattering of neutral hydrogen in the is medium. we find an anti-correlationbetween lya ew and the covering fraction, f_c, estimated from the depth ofabsorption lines, where f_c is an indicator of average neutral hydrogen columndensity, n_hi. the results of our study support the idea that n_hi is a keyquantity determining lya emissivity.

1403.0732	diffuse lyman-alpha halos around galaxies at z=2.2-6.6: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present diffuse lyman-alpha halos (lahs) identified in the compositesubaru narrowband images of 100-3600 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z=2.2, 3.1,3.7, 5.7, and 6.6. first, we carefully examine potential artifacts mimickinglahs that include a large-scale point-spread function (psf) made byinstrumental and atmospheric effects. based on our critical test with compositeimages of non-lae samples whose narrowband-magnitude and source-sizedistributions are the same as our lae samples, we confirm that no artifacts canproduce a diffuse extended feature similar to our lahs. after this test, wemeasure the scale lengths of exponential profile for the lahs estimated fromour z=2.2-6.6 lae samples of l(lyman-alpha) &gt; 2 x 10^42 erg s^-1. we obtain thescale lengths of ~ 5-10 kpc at z=2.2-5.7, and find no evolution of scalelengths in this redshift range beyond our measurement uncertainties. combiningthis result and the previously-known uv-continuum size evolution, we infer thatthe ratio of lah to uv-continuum sizes is nearly constant at z=2.2-5.7. thescale length of our z=6.6 lah is larger than 5-10 kpc just beyond the errorbar, which is a hint that the scale lengths of lahs would increase from z=5.7to 6.6. if this increase is confirmed by future large surveys with significantimprovements of statistical and systematical errors, this scale length changeat z &gt; 6 would be a signature of increasing fraction of neutral hydrogenscattering lyman-alpha photons, due to cosmic reionization.

1403.4360	faint submillimeter galaxies revealed by multifield deep alma  observations: number counts, spatial clustering, and a dark submillimeter  line emitter	we present the statistics of faint submillimeter/millimeter galaxies (smgs)and serendipitous detections of a submillimeter/millimeter line emitter (sle)with no multi-wavelength continuum counterpart revealed by the deep almaobservations. we identify faint smgs with flux densities of 0.1-1.0 mjy in thedeep band 6 and band 7 maps of 10 independent fields that reduce cosmicvariance effects. the differential number counts at 1.2 mm are found toincrease with decreasing flux density down to 0.1 mjy. our number countsindicate that the faint (0.1-1.0 mjy, or sfr_ir ~ 30-300 msun/yr) smgscontribute nearly a half of the extragalactic background light (ebl), while theremaining half of the ebl is mostly contributed by very faint sources with fluxdensities of &lt;0.1 mjy (sfr_ir &lt;~ 30 msun/yr). we conduct counts-in-cellsanalysis with the multifield alma data for the faint smgs, and obtain a coarseestimate of galaxy bias, b_g &lt;4. the galaxy bias suggests that the dark halomasses of the faint smgs are &lt;~ 7x10^12 msun, which is smaller than those ofbright (&gt;1 mjy) smgs, but consistent with abundant high-z star-formingpopulations such as sbzks, lbgs, and laes. finally, we report the serendipitousdetection of sle-1 with continuum counterparts neither in our 1.2 mm-band normulti-wavelength images including ultra deep hst/wfc3 and spitzer data. the slehas a significant line at 249.9 ghz with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.1. if thesle is not a spurious source made by unknown systematic noise of alma, thestrong upper limits of our multi-wavelength data suggest that the sle would bea faint galaxy at z &gt;~ 6.

1404.6066	accelerated evolution of ly$\alpha$ luminosity function at $\textit{z}  \gtrsim 7$ revealed by the subaru ultra-deep survey for ly$\alpha$ emitters  at $\textit{z}=7.3$	we present the ultra-deep subaru narrowband imaging survey for lya emitters(laes) at $z=7.3$ in sxds and cosmos fields with a total integration time of106 hours. exploiting our new sharp bandwidth filter, nb101, installed onsuprime-cam, we have reached $l(lya)=2.4\times10^{42} \ erg \ s^{-1}$($5\sigma$) for $z=7.3$ laes, about 4 times deeper than previous subaru $z\gtrsim 7$ studies, which allows us to reliably investigate evolution of lyaluminosity function (lf), for the first time, down to the luminosity limit sameas those of subaru $z=3.1-6.6$ lae samples. surprisingly, we only find threeand four laes in sxds and cosmos fields, respectively, while one expects atotal of $\sim 65$ laes by our survey in the case of no lya lf evolution from$z=6.6$ to $7.3$.we identify a decrease of lya lf from $z=6.6$ to $7.3$ at the$&gt;90\%$ confidence level from our $z=7.3$ lya lf.moreover, the evolution of lyalf is clearly accelerated at $z&gt;6.6$ beyond the measurement uncertaintiesincluding cosmic variance. because no such accelerated evolution ofuv-continuum lf or cosmic star-formation rate (sfr) is found at $z\sim 7$, butsuggested only at $z&gt;8$ (oesch et al. 2013, bouwens et al. 2014), thisaccelerated lya lf evolution is explained by physical mechanisms different froma pure sfr decrease but related to lya production and escape in the process ofcosmic reionization. because a simple accelerating increase of igm neutralhydrogen absorbing lya would not reconcile with thomson scattering opticaldepth measurements from wmap and planck, our findings may support new physicalpictures suggested by recent theoretical studies, such as the existence of hiclumpy clouds within cosmic ionized bubbles selectively absorbing lya and thelarge ionizing photon escape fraction of galaxies making weak lya emission.

1404.7656	large-scale environment of z~5.7 civ absorption systems i: projected  distribution of galaxies	metal absorption systems are products of star formation. they are believed tobe associated with massive star forming galaxies, which have significantlyenriched their surroundings. to test this idea with high column density civabsorption systems at z~5.7, we study the projected distribution of galaxiesand characterise the environment of civ systems in two independent quasarlines-of-sight: j103027.01+052455.0 and j113717.73+354956.9. using wide fieldphotometry (~80x60h$^{-1}$ comoving mpc), we select bright (muv(1350\aa)&lt;-21.0mag.) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z~5.7 in a redshift slice \delta z~0.2 andwe compare their projected distribution with z~5.7 narrow-band selected lymanalpha emitters (laes, \delta z~0.08).  we find that the civ systems are located more than 10h$^{-1}$ projectedcomoving mpc from the main concentrations of lbgs and no candidate is closerthan ~5h$^{-1}$ projected comoving mpc. in contrast, an excess of laes -lowermass galaxies- is found on scales of ~10h$^{-1}$ comoving mpc, suggesting thatlaes are the primary candidates for the source of the civ systems. furthermore,the closest object to the system in the field j1030+0524 is a faint lae at aprojected distance of 212h$^{-1}$ physical kpc. however, this work cannot ruleout undiscovered lower mass galaxies as the origin of these absorption systems.  we conclude that, in contrast with lower redshift examples (z&lt;3.5), strongciv absorption systems at z~5.7 trace low-to-intermediate density environmentsdominated by low-mass galaxies. moreover, the excess of laes associated withhigh levels of ionizing flux agrees with the idea that faint galaxies dominatethe ionizing photon budget at this redshift.

1406.6762	constraining dust formation in high-redshift young galaxies	core-collapse supernovae (sne) are believed to be the first significantsource of dust in the universe. such sne are expected to be the main dustproducers in young high-redshift lyman $\alpha$ emitters (laes) given theiryoung ages, providing an excellent testbed of sn dust formation models duringthe early stages of galaxy evolution. we focus on the dust enrichment of aspecific, luminous lae (himiko, $z\simeq 6.6$) for which a stringent upperlimit of $52.1~\mu$jy ($3\sigma$) has recently been obtained from almacontinuum observations at 1.2 mm. we predict its submillimetre dust emissionusing detailed models that follow sn dust enrichment and destruction and theequilibrium dust temperature, and obtain a plausible upper limit to the dustmass produced by a single sn: $m_\mathrm{d,sn} &lt; 0.15$--0.45 m$_\odot$,depending on the adopted dust optical properties. these upper limits aresmaller than the dust mass deduced for sn 1987a and that predicted by dustcondensation theories, implying that dust produced in sne are likely to besubject to reverse shock destruction before being injected into theinterstellar medium. finally, we provide a recipe for deriving$m_\mathrm{d,sn}$ from submillimetre observations of young, metal poor objectswherein condensation in sn ejecta is the dominant dust formation channel.

1406.7052	mosfire and ldss3 spectroscopy for an [oii] blob at z=1.18: gas outflow  and energy source	we report our keck/mosfire and magellan/ldss3 spectroscopy for an [oii] blob,oiib10, that is a high-$z$ galaxy with spatially extended[oii]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$ emission over 30 kpc recently identified by asubaru large-area narrowband survey. the systemic redshift of oiib10 is$z=1.18$ securely determined with [oiii]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ and h$\beta$emission lines. we identify feii$\lambda$2587 and mgii$\lambda\lambda$2796,2804absorption lines blueshifted from the systemic redshift by $80\pm50$ and$260\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively, which indicate gas outflow from oiib10with the velocity of $\sim 80-260$ km s$^{-1}$. this outflow velocity iscomparable with the escape velocity, $250\pm140$ km s$^{-1}$, estimated underthe assumption of a singular isothermal halo potential profile. some fractionof the outflowing gas could escape from the halo of oiib10, suppressingoiib10's star-formation activity. we estimate a mass loading factor, $\eta$,that is a ratio of mass outflow rate to star-formation rate, and obtain$\eta&gt;0.8\pm 0.1$ which is relatively high compared with low-$z$ starburstsincluding u/lirgs and agns. the major energy source of the outflow is unclearwith the available data. although no signature of agn is found in the x-raydata, oiib10 falls in the agn/star-forming composite region in the linediagnostic diagrams. it is possible that the outflow is powered by starformation and a type-2 agn with narrow fwhm emission line widths of $70-130$ kms$^{-1}$. this is the first detailed spectroscopic study of oxygen-line blobs,which includes the analyses of the escape velocity, the mass loading factor,and the presence of an agn, and a significant step to understanding the natureof oxygen-line blobs and the relation with gas outflow and star-formationquenching at high redshift.

1408.6903	hubble frontier fields first complete cluster data: faint galaxies at  $z\sim 5-10$ for uv luminosity functions and cosmic reionization	we present the comprehensive analyses of faint dropout galaxies up to$z\sim10$ with the first full-depth data set of abell 2744 lensing cluster andparallel fields observed by the hubble frontier fields (hff) program. weidentify $54$ dropouts at $z\sim5-10$ in the hff fields, and enlarge the sizeof $z\sim9$ galaxy sample obtained to date. although the number of highlymagnified ($\mu\sim10$) galaxies is small due to the tiny survey volume ofstrong lensing, our study reaches the galaxies' intrinsic luminositiescomparable to the deepest-field hudf studies. we derive uv luminosity functionswith these faint dropouts, carefully evaluating the combination ofobservational incompleteness and lensing effects in the image plane byintensive simulations including magnification, distortion, and multiplicationof images, with the evaluations of mass model dependences. our results confirmthat the faint-end slope, $\alpha$, is as steep as $-2$ at $z\sim6-8$, andstrengthen the evidence of the rapid decrease of uv luminosity densities,$\rho_\mathrm{uv}$, at $z&gt;8$ from the large $z\sim9$ sample. we examine whetherthe rapid $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decrease trend can reconcile with the largethomson scattering optical depth, $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, measured by cmbexperiments allowing a large space of free parameters such as average ionizingphoton escape fraction and stellar-population dependent conversion factor. noparameter set can reproduce both the rapid $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decrease and thelarge $\tau_\mathrm{e}$. it is possible that the $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decreasemoderates at $z\gtrsim11$, that the free parameters significantly evolvetowards high-$z$, or that there exist additional sources of reionization suchas x-ray binaries and faint agns.

1410.1535	the sizes of $z\sim6-8$ lensed galaxies from the hubble frontier fields  abell 2744 data	we investigate sizes of $z\sim6-8$ dropout galaxies using the complete dataof the abell 2744 cluster and parallel fields in the hubble frontier fieldsprogram. by directly fitting light profiles of observed galaxies withlensing-distorted s\'ersic profiles on the image plane with the \texttt{glafic}software, we accurately measure intrinsic sizes of 31 $z\sim6-7$ and eight$z\sim8$ galaxies, including those as faint as $m_{\mathrm{uv}}\simeq-16.6$. wefind that half-light radii $r_\mathrm{e}$ positively correlates with uvluminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very tight.largest ($r_\mathrm{e}&gt;0.8$ kpc) galaxies are mostly red in uv color whilesmallest ($r_\mathrm{e} &lt; 0.08$ kpc) ones tend to be blue. we also find thatgalaxies with multiple cores tend to be brighter. combined with previousresults at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim12$, our result confirms that the average$r_{\mathrm{e}}$ of bright ($(0.3-1)l^\star_{z=3}$) galaxies scales as$r_{\mathrm{e}}\propto(1+z)^{-m}$ with $m=1.24\pm0.1$. we find that the ratioof $r_\mathrm{e}$ to virial radius is virtually constant at $3.3\pm0.1\%$ overa wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos arederived based on the abundance matching. this constant ratio is consistent withthe disk formation model by mo et al. (1998) with $j_\mathrm{d}\simm_\mathrm{d}$, where $j_\mathrm{d}$ and $m_\mathrm{d}$ are the fractions of theangular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. a comparison withvarious types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar tocircumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that asizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.

1410.1551	the relationship between stellar mass, gas metallicity, and star  formation rate for halpha-selected galaxies at z~0.8 from the newhalpha  survey	using a sample of 299 ha-selected galaxies at z~0.8, we study therelationship between galaxy stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and starformation rate (sfr), and compare to previous results. we use deep opticalspectra obtained with the imacs spectrograph at the magellan telescope tomeasure strong oxygen lines. we combine these spectra and metallicities with(1) rest-frame uv-to-optical imaging, which allows us to determine stellarmasses and dust attenuation corrections, and (2) ha narrowband imaging, whichprovides a robust measure of the instantaneous sfr. our sample spans stellarmasses of 10^9 to 6*10^11 solar masses, sfrs of 0.4 to 270 solar masses peryear, and metal abundances of 12+log(o/h)~8.3-9.1 (~0.4-2.6 solar metallicity).the correlations that we find between the ha-based sfr and stellar mass (i.e.,the star-forming "main sequence"), and between the stellar mass andmetallicity, are both consistent with previous z~1 studies of star-forminggalaxies. we then study the relationship between the three properties usingvarious plane-fitting techniques (lara-lopez et al.) and a curve-fittingprojection (mannucci et al.). in all cases, we exclude strong dependence of them-z relation on sfr, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and nodependence. our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-sfrstudies. we check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependenceon the sfr by using mock samples drawn from the sdss. these experiments revealthat the adopted signal-to-noise cuts may have a significant effect on themeasured dependence. further work is needed to investigate these results, andto test whether a "fundamental metallicity relation" or a "fundamental plane"describes star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.

1502.01349	on the diffuse lyman-alpha halo around lyman-alpha emitting galaxies	ly$\alpha$ photons scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms in the circumgalacticmedia or produced in the halos of star-forming galaxies are expected to lead toextended ly$\alpha$ emission around galaxies. such low surface brightnessly$\alpha$ halos (lahs) have been detected by stacking ly$\alpha$ images ofhigh-redshift star-forming galaxies. we study the origin of lahs by performingradiative transfer modeling of nine $z=3.1$ lyman-alpha emitters (laes) in ahigh resolution hydrodynamic cosmological galaxy formation simulation. wedevelop a method of computing the mean ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profile ofeach lae by effectively integrating over many different observing directions.without adjusting any parameters, our model yields an average ly$\alpha$surface brightness profile in remarkable agreement with observations. we findthat observed lahs cannot be accounted for solely by photons originating fromthe central lae and scattered to large radii by hydrogen atoms in thecircumgalactic gas. instead, ly$\alpha$ emission from regions in the outer halois primarily responsible for producing the extended lahs seen in observations,which potentially includes both star-forming and cooling radiation. with thelimit on the star formation contribution set by the ultra-violet (uv) halomeasurement, we find that cooling radiation can play an important role informing the extended lahs. we discuss the implications and caveats of such apicture.

1509.06900	evolution of star formation in the ukidss ultra deep survey field - ii.  star formation as a function of stellar mass between z=1.46 and z=0.63	we present new results on the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate asa function of stellar mass in the sxds-uds field. we make use of narrow-bandselected emission line galaxies in four redshift slices between z = 1.46 and z= 0.63, and compute stellar masses by fitting a series of templates to recreateeach galaxy's star formation history. we determine mass-binned luminosityfunctions in each redshift slice, and derive the star formation rate density(rhosfr) as a function of mass using the [oiii] or [oii] emission lines. wecalculate dust extinction and metallicity as a function of stellar mass, andinvestigate the effect of these corrections on the shape of the overallrhosfr(m). we find that both these corrections are crucial for determining theshape of the rhosfr(m), and its evolution with redshift. the fully correctedrhosfr(m) is a relatively flat distribution, with the normalisation movingtowards lower values of rhosfr with increasing cosmic time/decreasing redshift,and requiring star formation to be truncated across all masses studied here.the peak of rhosfr(m) is found in the 10^10.5&lt;msun&lt;10^11.0 mass bin at z =1.46. in the lower redshift slices the location of the peak is less certain,however low mass galaxies in the range 10^7.0&lt;msun&lt;10^8.0 play an importantpart in the overall rhosfr(m) out to at least z ~ 1.2.

1511.01519	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z\ge6$.  iii. stellar populations from sed modeling with secure ly$\alpha$ emission  and redshifts	we present a study of stellar populations in a sample ofspectroscopically-confirmed lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) at $5.7&lt;z&lt;7$. these galaxies have deep optical and infrared images fromsubaru, $hst$, and $spitzer$/irac. we focus on a subset of 27 galaxies withirac detections, and characterize their stellar populations utilizing galaxysynthesis models based on the multi-band data and secure redshifts. byincorporating nebular emission estimated from the observed ly$\alpha$ flux, weare able to break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxieswith prominent nebular emission and older galaxies with strong balmer breaks.the results show that our galaxies cover a wide range of ages from several to afew hundred million years (myr), and a wide range of stellar masses from$\sim10^8$ to $\sim10^{11}$ $m_{\odot}$. these galaxies can be roughly dividedinto an `old' subsample and a `young' subsample. the `old' subsample consistsof galaxies older than 100 myr, with stellar masses higher than $10^9$$m_{\odot}$. the galaxies in the `young' subsample are younger than $\sim$30myr, with masses ranging between $\sim10^8$ and $\sim3\times10^9$ $m_{\odot}$.both subsamples display a correlation between stellar mass and star-formationrate (sfr), but with very different normalizations. the average specific sfr(ssfr) of the `old' subsample is 3--4 gyr$^{-1}$, consistent with previousstudies of `normal' star-forming galaxies at $z\ge6$. the average ssfr of the`young' subsample is an order of magnitude higher, likely due to starburstactivity. our results also indicate little or no dust extinction in themajority of the galaxies, as already suggested by their steep rest-frame uvslopes. finally, laes and lbgs with strong ly$\alpha$ emission areindistinguishable in terms of age, stellar mass, and sfr.

astro-ph;0508536	masses of high-z galaxy hosting haloes from angular clustering and their  evolution in the cdm model	we examine masses of hosting haloes of two photometrically-selected high-zgalaxy samples: the old passively-evolving galaxies (opegs) and lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) both taken from the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). thelarge survey area of the sxds (1sq deg) allows us to measure the angulartwo-point correlation functions to a wide separation of &gt;10 arcmin with a goodstatistical quality. we utilize the halo model prescription for estimatingcharacteristic masses of hosting haloes from the measured large-scaleclustering amplitudes. it is found that the hosting halo mass positivelycorrelates with the luminosity of galaxies. then, adopting the extendedpress-schechter model (eps), we compute the predictions for the mass evolutionof the hosting haloes in the framework of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologyin order to make an evolutionary link between the two galaxy samples atdifferent redshifts and to identify their present-day descendants by lettingtheir haloes evolve forward in time. it is found that, in the view of the massevolution of hosting haloes in the cdm model, bright lbgs are consistent withbeing the progenitor of the opegs, whereas it is less likely that the lbgpopulation, as a whole, have evolved into the opeg population. it is also foundthat the present-day descendants of both the bright lbgs and opegs are likelyto be located in massive systems such as groups of galaxies or clusters ofgalaxies. finally, we estimate the hosting halo mass of local early-type galaxysamples from the 2df and sdss based on the halo model and it turns out thattheir expected characteristic mass of hosting haloes is in good agreement withthe eps predictions for the descendant's mass of both the bright lbgs andopegs.

astro-ph;0508594	the number density of old passively-evolving galaxies at z=1 in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field	we obtained the number counts and the rest-frame b-band luminosity functionof the color-selected old passively-evolving galaxies (opegs) at z=1 with veryhigh statistical accuracy using a large and homogeneous sample of about 4000such objects with z' &lt;25 detected in the area of 1.03 deg^2 in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. our selection criteria are definedon the i'-z' and r-z' color-magnitude plane so that opegs at z=0.9-1.1 withformation redshift z_f=2-10 are properly sampled. the limiting magnitudecorresponds to the luminosity of galaxies with m_*+3 at z=0. we made a pilotredshift observations for 99 opeg candidates with 19 &lt; z' &lt; 22 and found thatat least 78% (73/93) of the entire sample, or 95% (73/77) of these whoseredshifts were obtained are indeed lie between z=0.87 and 1.12 and the most oftheir spectra show the continuum break and strong ca h and k lines, indicatingthat these objects are indeed dominated by the old stellar populations. we thencompare our results with the luminosity functions of the color- or themorphologically-selected early type galaxies at z=0 taking the evolutionaryfactor into account and found that the number density of old passive galaxieswith sim m_* magnitude at z~1 averaged over the sxds area is 40-60% of theequivalently red galaxies and 60-85% of the morphologically-selected e/s0galaxies at z=0 depending on their luminosity evolution. it is revealed thatmore than half, but not all, of the present-day early-type galaxies had alreadybeen formed into quiescent passive galaxies at z=1.

astro-ph;0509564	clustering of lyman break galaxies at z=4 and 5 in the subaru deep  field: luminosity dependence of the correlation function slope	we explored the clustering properties of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z=4and 5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the verydeep and wide subaru deep field data. we found an apparent dependence of thecorrelation function slope on uv luminosity for lbgs at both z=4 and 5. moreluminous lbgs have a steeper correlation function. to compare theseobservational results, we constructed numerical mock lbg catalogs based on asemianalytic model of hierarchical clustering combined with high-resolutionn-body simulation, carefully mimicking the observational selection effects. theluminosity functions for lbgs predicted by this mock catalog were found to bealmost consistent with the observation. moreover, the overall correlationfunctions of lbgs were reproduced reasonably well. the observed dependence ofthe clustering on uv luminosity was not reproduced by the model, unlesssubsamples of distinct halo mass were considered. that is, lbgs belonging tomore massive dark haloes had steeper and larger-amplitude correlationfunctions. with this model, we found that lbg multiplicity in massive darkhalos amplifies the clustering strength at small scales, which steepens theslope of the correlation function. the hierarchical clustering model couldtherefore be reconciled with the observed luminosity-dependence of the angularcorrelation function, if there is a tight correlation between uv luminosity andhalo mass. our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends onluminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted multiplebright lbgs (abridged).

astro-ph;0604479	where are the z=4 lyman break galaxies? results from conditional  luminosity function models of luminosity-dependent correlation functions	using the conditional luminosity function (clf) -- the luminositydistribution of galaxies in a dark matter halo -- as a way to model galaxystatistics, we study how z=4 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) are distributed indark matter halos. for this purpose, we measure luminosity-dependent clusteringof lbgs in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field by separating a sample of 16,920galaxies to three magnitude bins in i'-band between 24.5 and 27.5. our modelsfits to data show a possible trend for more luminous galaxies to appear assatellites in more massive halos. the satellite fraction of galaxies at z=4 inthese magnitude bins is 0.13 to 0.3, 0.09 to 0.22, and 0.03 to 0.14,respectively, where the 1 sigma ranges account for differences coming from twodifferent estimates of the z=4 lf from the literature. to jointly explain thelf and the large-scale linear bias factor of z=4 lbgs as a function of rest-uvluminosity requires central galaxies to be brighter in uv at z =4 thanpresent-day galaxies in same dark matter mass halos. moreover, uv luminosity ofcentral galaxies in halos with total mass greater than roughly 10^{12} m_sunmust decrease from z=4 to today by an amount more than the luminosity changefor galaxies in halos below this mass. this mass-dependent luminosity evolutionis preferred at more than 3 sigma confidence level compared to apure-luminosity evolution scenario where all galaxies decrease in luminosity bythe same amount from z=4 to today. the scenario preferred by the data isconsistent with the ``down-sizing'' picture of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0605360	systematic survey of extended lyman-alpha sources over z~3-5	spatially extended ly-alpha sources which are faint and compact in coninuumare candidates for extremely young galaxies (age of ~&lt;10e+7 yrs) at highredshifts. we carried out a systematic survey for extended ly-alpha sources,using deep intermediate-band imaging data taken with the suprime-cam on thesubaru telescope. our survey covers a field of view of 33' * 25' and a redshiftrange of 3.24&lt;z&lt;4.95, down to a ly-alpha flux of ~1e-17 ergs/cm^2/s. weidentified 41 extended ly-alpha sources. the redshift distribution of thesesources shows that this kind of objects are common in the early universe overthe surveyed redshift range. the identified objects have typical sizes of\~10-15 kpc and luminosities of ~10^42 ergs/s. follow-up spectroscopy made for7 of the 41 objects showed that our sample suffers from little contamination.all 7 objects have large equivalent widths of ly-alpha emission line, all butone exceeding 240a in the rest frame. the large equivalent widths suggest thattheir extended ly-alpha emissions are unlikely to be due to normal starbursts,but possibly originated from very young galaxies. all 41 objects in our samplehave much smaller ly-alpha luminosities than the two ly-alpha blobs (labs)found by steidel et al. (2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. thissuggests that large and luminous extended ly-alpha objects like the two labsare very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

astro-ph;0608512	luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies at z~4 and 5 in the subaru  deep field	we investigate the luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z~4and 5 based on the optical imaging data obtained in the subaru deep fieldproject. three samples of lbgs in a contiguous 875 arcmin^2 area areconstructed. one consists of 3,808 lbgs at z~4 down to i'=26.85 selected withthe b-r vs r-i' diagram. the other two consist of 539 and 240 lbgs at z~5 downto z'=26.05 selected with two kinds of two-color diagrams: v-i' vs i'-z' andr-i' vs i'-z'. the adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliableby spectroscopic observation. we derive the luminosity functions of the lbgs atrest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to m_{uv}=-19.2 at z~4 and m_{uv}=-20.3at z~5. we find clear evolution of the luminosity function over the redshiftrange of 0&lt;z&lt;6, which is accounted for by a sole change in the characteristicmagnitude, m^*. the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) density at z~4 and z~5 ismeasured from the luminosity functions. we examine the evolution of the cosmicsfr density and its luminosity dependence over 0&lt;z&lt;6. the sfr densitycontributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically withcosmic time. the contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak aroundz=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broadpeak at earlier epoch. combining the observed sfr density with the standardcold dark matter model, we compute the cosmic sfr per unit baryon mass in darkhaloes, i.e., the specific sfr. the specific sfr is found to scale withredshift as (1+z)^3 up to z~4, implying that the efficiency of star formationis on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the cooling ratewithin dark haloes, while this is not simply the case at z&gt;4.

astro-ph;0609393	a galaxy at a redshift z = 6.96	when galaxy formation started in the history of the universe remains unclear.studies of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe, afterinitial cooling (following the big bang), was reheated and reionized by hotstars in newborn galaxies at a redshift in the range 6 &lt; z &lt; 14 (ref. 1).though several candidate galaxies at redshift z &gt; 7 have been identifiedphotometrically (refs 2,3), galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshiftshave been confined to z &lt; 6.6 (refs. 4-8). here we report a spectroscopicredshift of z = 6.96 (corresponding to just 750 myr after the big bang) for agalaxy whose spectrum clearly shows lyman-alpha emission at 9,682 a, indicatingactive star formation at a rate of about 10 m_sun/yr, where m_sun us the massof the sun. this demonstrates that galaxy formation was under way when theuniverse was only about 6 per cent of its present age. the number density ofgalaxies at z = 7 seems to be only 18-36 per cent of the density at z = 6.6.

astro-ph;0610349	moircs deep survey. i: drg number counts	we use very deep near-infrared imaging data taken with multi-object infraredcamera and spectrograph (moircs) on the subaru telescope to investigate thenumber counts of distant red galaxies (drgs). we have observed a 4x7 arcmin^2field in the great observatories origins deep survey north (goods-n), and ourdata reach j=24.6 and k=23.2 (5sigma, vega magnitude). the surface density ofdrgs selected by j-k&gt;2.3 is 2.35+-0.31 arcmin^-2 at k&lt;22 and 3.54+-0.38arcmin^-2 at k&lt;23, respectively. these values are consistent with those in thegoods-south and fires. our deep and wide data suggest that the number counts ofdrgs turn over at k~22, and the surface density of the faint drgs with k&gt;22 issmaller than that expected from the number counts at the brighter magnitude.the result indicates that while there are many bright galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;4 withthe relatively old stellar population and/or heavy dust extinction, the numberof the faint galaxies with the similar red color is relatively small. differentbehaviors of the number counts of the drgs and bluer galaxies with 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4at k&gt;22 suggest that the mass-dependent color distribution, where most oflow-mass galaxies are blue while more massive galaxies tend to have reddercolors, had already been established at that epoch.

astro-ph;0701820	moircs deep survey. ii. clustering properties of k-band selected  galaxies in goods-north region	we present the first measurement of clustering properties of low massgalaxies with a stellar mass down to m_*~10^9 msun at 1&lt;z&lt;4 in 24.4 arcmin^2 ofthe goods-north region with a depth of k_{ab}~25, based on the near infraredobservations performed with moircs at the subaru telescope. the correlationamplitude strongly depends on the k-band flux, color, and stellar mass of thegalaxies. we find that k-band luminous galaxies have a larger correlationlength than k-band faint galaxies. for color selected samples at 2&lt;z&lt;4, distantred galaxies with j-k&gt;1.3 show a large bias of b~7.2+-1.3 on scales up to\theta~100" or 3.1 comoving mpc, while blue galaxies with 0.5&lt;j-k&lt;1.3, in whichmost lyman break galaxies are populated, have a weak clustering signal on largescales, but a possible strong small scale excess at \theta&lt;10". for massivegalaxies with m_*&gt;~10^{10} msun, we estimate a correlation length and bias tobe r_0~4.5 h^{-1} mpc and b=1.9-3.5, which are much larger than those of lowmass (m_*~10^9-10^{10} msun) galaxies. the comparison of our measurements withanalytic cdm models constrains the properties of hosting dark halos, andindicates that the low mass galaxies would be progenitors of galaxies with atypical luminosity of l&lt;~l_* in the local universe. the blue galaxies in lowmass samples are more strongly clustered in more massive halos with higheroccupation numbers than low mass red galaxies. this fact suggests anenvironment effect due to the halo mass on star formation activity at high-z.

astro-ph;9903299	expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of lyman break galaxies at  high redshift	we investigate expected sub-mm emission and dust properties of the lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) in the hubble deep field (hdf). the scuba deep survey(hughes et al., 1998) provides an upper limit of the 850 micron flux densitiesof the lbgs. with this constraint, we argue that a typical ultra-violet tofar-infrared spectral shape of the high-redshift lbgs is rather close to atemplate spectrum of low-reddening starburst galaxies in the local universe butdifferent from that of heavily dust-enshrouded ultra-luminous far-infraredgalaxies like arp220. we also evaluate the lower-limit temperature of dust inlbgs assuming single- and two-component modified black-body spectrum. toestimate the total amount of energy re-emitted in fir wavelength, we take twodifferent approaches; model fitting of the uv spectra of lbgs and an empiricalmethod using the relationship between uv spectral shape and uv/fir flux ratioobserved for local starburst galaxies. both methods give lower-limittemperature of the lbgs as around 40 k, which is higher than the typical dusttemperature of local optical- and infrared-selected galaxies. this result isalso supported by the comparison of the expected sub-mm flux of the lbgs withthe cosmic fir background radiation. the high dust temperature may indicate theeffective massive-star formation or different dust properties in thehigh-redshift lbgs.
