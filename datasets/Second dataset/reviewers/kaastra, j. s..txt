0902.1094	effective area calibration of the reflection grating spectrometers of  xmm-newton. i. x-ray spectroscopy of the crab nebula	the crab nebula and pulsar have been widely used as a calibration source forx-ray instruments. the in-flight effective area calibration of the reflectiongrating spectrometers (rgs) of xmm-newton depend upon the availability ofreliable calibration sources. we investigate how the absolute effective areacalibration of rgs can be obtained using crab as a standard candle. we haveanalysed rgs observations of the crab using different instrument configurationsand spatial offsets, and made use of previous determinations of the continuumspectrum of the nebula plus pulsar. due to the high spectral resolution of thergs, we resolve the main absorption edges and detect the strong 1s-2pabsorption lines of neutral oxygen. we get an excellent fit to the crabspectrum using this fixed continuum and the absorption spectrum determined byrgs. we get accurate column densities for the neutral atoms of h, n, o, ne, mg,and fe, as well as a clear detection of fe ii and firm upper limits for otherions. our data are in good agreement with earlier optical and uv spectroscopicmeasurements of some of these ions. we find solar abundances for n and o, whilene is overabundant by a factor of 1.7 and fe is underabundant by a factor of0.8. we confirm that there is less dust in the line of sight compared to theprediction based on the absorption column. our spectra suggest a more prominentrole of ferric iron in the dust compared to ferrous iron. our high-resolutionobservations confirm that crab can be used as an x-ray calibration source. rgsspectra have determined the absorption spectrum towards crab with unprecedenteddetail.

0902.2282	effective area calibration of the reflection grating spectrometers of  xmm-newton. ii. x-ray spectroscopy of da white dwarfs	white dwarf spectra have been widely used as a calibration source for x-rayand euv instruments. the in-flight effective area calibration of the reflectiongrating spectrometers (rgs) of xmm-newton depend upon the availability ofreliable calibration sources. we investigate how well these white dwarf spectracan be used as standard candles at the lowest x-ray energies in order to gaugethe absolute effective area scale of x-ray instruments. we calculate a grid ofmodel atmospheres for sirius b and hz 43a, and adjust the parameters usingseveral constraints until the ratio of the spectra of both stars agrees withthe ratio as observed by the low energy transmission grating spectrometer(letgs) of chandra. this ratio is independent of any errors in the effectivearea of the letgs. we find that we can constrain the absolute x-ray spectrum ofboth stars with better than 5 % accuracy. the best-fit model for both stars isclose to a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and we put tight limits to the amount ofhelium or the thickness of a hydrogen layer in both stars. our upper limit tothe helium abundance in sirius b is 4 times below the previous detection basedon euve data. we also find that our results are sensitive to the adoptedcut-off in the lyman pseudo-continuum opacity in sirius b. we get bestagreement with a long wavelength cut-off. white dwarf model atmospheres can beused to derive the effective area of x-ray spectrometers in the lowest energyband. an accuracy of 3-4 % in the absolute effective area can be achieved.

0902.2310	mass outflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548	we present a study of the intrinsic uv absorption and emission lines in anhistorically low-state spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548, which weobtained in 2004 february at high spatial and spectral resolution with thespace telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on the hubble space telescope. weisolate a component of emission with a width of 680 km/s (fwhm) that arisesfrom an "intermediate line region" (ilr), similar to the one we discovered inngc 4151, at a distance of ~1 pc from the central continuum source. from adetailed analysis of the five intrinsic absorption components in ngc 5548 andtheir behavior over a span of 8 years, we present evidence that most of the uvabsorbers only partially cover the ilr and do not cover an extended region ofuv continuum emission, most likely from hot stars in the circumnuclear region.we also find that four of the uv absorbers are at much greater distances (&gt;70pc) than the ilr, and none have sufficient n v or c iv column densities to bethe ilr in absorption. at least a portion of the uv absorption component 3, ata radial velocity of -530 km/s, is likely responsible for most of the x-rayabsorption, at a distance &lt; 7 pc from the central source. the fact that we seethe ilr in absorption in ngc 4151 and not in ngc 5548 suggests that the ilr islocated at a relatively large polar angle (~45 degrees) with respect to thenarrow-line region outflow axis.

0904.0254	constraints on turbulent pressure in the x-ray halos of giant elliptical  galaxies from resonant scattering	the dense cores of x-ray emitting gaseous halos of large elliptical galaxieswith temperatures below about 0.8 kev show two prominent fe xvii emissionfeatures, which provide a sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the effects ofresonant scattering. we present here high-resolution spectra of five brightnearby elliptical galaxies, obtained with the reflection grating spectrometers(rgs) on the xmm-newton satellite. the spectra for the cores of four of thegalaxies show the fe xvii line at 15.01 angstrom being suppressed by resonantscattering. the data for ngc 4636 in particular allow the effects of resonantscattering to be studied in detail and to prove that the 15.01 angstrom line issuppressed only in the dense core and not in the surrounding regions. usingdeprojected density and temperature profiles for this galaxy obtained with thechandra satellite, we model the radial intensity profiles of the strongestresonance lines, accounting for the effects of resonant scattering, fordifferent values of the characteristic turbulent velocity. comparing the modelto the data, we find that the isotropic turbulent velocities on spatial scalessmaller than about 1 kpc are less than 100 km/s and the turbulent pressuresupport in the galaxy core is smaller than 5% of the thermal pressure at the90% confidence level, and less than 20% at 95% confidence. neglecting theeffects of resonant scattering in spectral fitting of the inner 2 kpc core ofngc 4636 will lead to underestimates of the chemical abundances of fe and o by~10-20%.

0905.4802	non-maxwellian electron distributions in clusters of galaxies	thermal x-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies and other sources are commonlycalculated assuming maxwellian electron distributions. there are situationswhere this approximation is not valid, for instance near interfaces of hot andcold gas and near shocks. the presence of non-thermal electrons affects thex-ray spectrum. to study the role of these electrons in clusters and otherenvironments, an efficient algorithm to calculate the x-ray spectra is needed.we approximate an arbitrary electron distribution by the sum of maxwelliancomponents. the decomposition is done using either a genetic algorithm or ananalytical approximation. the x-ray spectrum is then evaluated using a linearcombination of those maxwellian components. our method is fast and leads to anaccurate evaluation of the spectrum. the use of maxwellian components allows touse the standard collisional rates that are available in plasma codes such asspex. we give an example of a spectrum for the supra-thermal electrondistribution behind a shock in a cluster of galaxies. the relative intensitiesof the satellite lines in such a spectrum are sensitive to the presence of thesupra-thermal electrons. these lines can only be investigated with highspectral resolution. we show that the instruments on future missions likeastro-h and ixo will be able to demonstrate the presence or absence of thesesupra-thermal electrons.

0907.2521	a model of polarized x-ray emission from twinkling synchrotron supernova  shells	synchrotron x-ray emission components were recently detected in many youngsupernova remnants (snrs). there is even an emerging class - sn1006,rxj1713.72-3946, vela jr, and others - that is dominated by non-thermalemission in x-rays, also probably of synchrotron origin. such emission resultsfrom electrons/positrons accelerated well above tev energies in the spectralcut-off regime. in the case of diffusive shock acceleration, which is the mostpromising acceleration mechanism in snrs, very strong magnetic fluctuationswith amplitudes well above the mean magnetic field must be present. startingfrom such a fluctuating field, we have simulated images of polarized x-rayemission of snr shells and show that these are highly clumpy with highpolarizations up to 50%. another distinct characteristic of this emission isthe strong intermittency, resulting from the fluctuating field amplifications.the details of this "twinkling" polarized x-ray emission of snrs dependstrongly on the magnetic-field fluctuation spectra, providing a potentiallysensitive diagnostic tool. we demonstrate that the predicted characteristicscan be studied with instruments that are currently being considered. these cangive unique information on magnetic-field characteristics and high-energyparticle acceleration in snrs.

1001.2712	xmm-newton unveils the complex iron k alpha region of mrk 279	we present the results of a ~160 ks-long xmm-newton observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279. the spectrum shows evidence of both broad and narrowemission features. the fe k alpha line may be equally well explained by asingle broad gaussian (fwhm~10,000 km/s) or by two components: an unresolvedcore plus a very broad profile (fwhm~14,000 km/s). for the first time wequantified, via the "locally optimally emitting cloud" model, the contributionof the broad line region (blr) to the absolute luminosity of the broadcomponent of the fe k alpha at 6.4 kev. we find that the contribution of theblr is only ~3%. in the two-line component scenario, we also evaluated thecontribution of the highly ionized gas component, which produces the fexxviline in the iron k region. this contribution to the narrow core of the fe kalpha line is marginal &lt;0.1%. most of the luminosity of the unresolved,component of fe k alpha may come from the obscuring torus, while the very-broadassociated component may come from the accretion disk. however, models ofreflection by cold gas are difficult to test because of the limited energyband. the fexxvi line at 6.9 kev is consistent to be produced in a high columndensity (n_h~10^23 cm^{-2}), extremely ionized (log\xi~5.5-7) gas. this gas maybe a highly ionized outer layer of the torus.

1006.2027	xmm-newton rgs observation of the warm absorber in mrk 279	the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279 was observed by xmm-newton in november 2005 inthree consecutive orbits, showing significant short-scale variability (averagesoft band variation in flux ~20%). the source is known to host a two-componentwarm absorber with distinct ionisation states from a previous chandraobservation. we aim to study the warm absorber in mrk 279 and investigate anypossible response to the short-term variations of the ionising flux, and toassess whether it has varied on a long-term time scale with respect to thechandra observation. we find no significant changes in the warm absorber onneither short time scales (~2 days) nor at longer time scales (two and a halfyears), as the variations in the ionic column densities of the most relevantelements are below the 90% confidence level. the variations could still bepresent but are statistically undetected given the signal-to-noise ratio of thedata. starting from reasonable standard assumptions we estimate the location ofthe absorbing gas, which is likely to be associated with the putative dustytorus rather than with the broad line region if the outflowing gas is moving atthe escape velocity or larger.

1104.0001	the metal contents of two groups of galaxies	the hot gas in clusters and groups of galaxies is continuously being enrichedwith metals from supernovae and stars. it is well established that theenrichment of the gas with elements from oxygen to iron is mainly caused bysupernova explosions. the origins of nitrogen and carbon are still beingdebated. possible candidates include massive, metal-rich stars, earlygenerations of massive stars, intermediate or low mass stars and asymptoticgiant branch (agb) stars. in this paper we accurately determine the metalabundances of the gas in the groups of galaxies ngc 5044 and ngc 5813, anddiscuss the nature of the objects that create these metals.  we mainly focus on carbon and nitrogen. we use spatially-resolvedhigh-resolution x-ray spectroscopy from xmm-newton. for the spectral fitting,multi-temperature hot gas models are used. the abundance ratios of carbon overoxygen and nitrogen over oxygen that we find are high compared to the ratios inthe stars in the disk of our galaxy. the oxygen and nitrogen abundances wederive are similar to what was found in earlier work on other giant ellipticalsin comparable environments. we show that the iron abundances in both oursources have a gradient along the cross-dispersion direction of the reflectiongrating spectrometer (rgs). we conclude that it is unlikely that the creationof nitrogen and carbon takes place in massive stars, which end their lives ascore-collapse supernovae, enriching the medium with oxygen because oxygenshould then also be enhanced. therefore we favour low-and intermediate massstars as sources of these elements. the abundances in the hot gas can best beexplained by a 30-40% contribution of type ia supernovae based on the measuredoxygen and iron abundances and under the assumption of a salpeter initial massfunction (imf).

1201.1910	estimating turbulent velocities in the elliptical galaxies ngc 5044 and  ngc 5813	the interstellar and intra-cluster medium in giant elliptical galaxies andclusters of galaxies is often assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium.numerical simulations, however, show that about 5-30% of the pressure in acluster is provided by turbulence induced by, for example, the central agn andmerger activity. we aim to put constraints on the turbulent velocities andturbulent pressure in the icm of the giant elliptical galaxies ngc 5044 and ngc5813 using xmm-newton rgs observations. the magnitude of the turbulence isestimated using the fe xvii lines at 15.01 a, 17.05 a, and 17.10 a in the rgsspectra. at low turbulent velocities, the gas becomes optically thick in the15.01 a line due to resonant scattering, while the 17 a lines remain opticallythin. by comparing the (i(17.05)+i(17.10))/i(15.01) line ratio from rgs withsimulated line ratios for different mach numbers, the level of turbulence isconstrained. the measurement is limited by systematic uncertainties in theatomic data, which are at the 20-30% level. we find that the line ratio in ngc5813 is significantly higher than in ngc 5044. this difference can be explainedby a higher level of turbulence in ngc 5044. the high turbulent velocities andthe fraction of the turbulent pressure support of &gt;40% in ngc 5044, assumingisotropic turbulence, confirm that it is a highly disturbed system, probablydue to an off-axis merger. the turbulent pressure support in ngc 5813 is moremodest at 15-45%. the (i(17.05)+i(17.10))/i(15.01) line ratio in an opticallythin plasma, calculated using atomdb v2.0.1, is 2 sigma above the ratiomeasured in ngc 5044, which cannot be explained by resonant scattering. thisshows that the discrepancies between theoretical, laboratory, and astrophysicaldata on fe xvii lines need to be reduced to improve the accuracy of thedetermination of turbulent velocities using resonant scattering.

1205.2559	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 x. lower limit on the distance of  the absorber from hst cos and stis spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei often show evidence of photoionized outflows. a majoruncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($r$) to the gas fromthe central black hole. in this paper we use the hst/cos data from a massivemulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert i galaxy mrk 509, incombination with archival hst/stis data, to constrain the location of thevarious kinematic components of the outflow. we compare the expected responseof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measuredin the data using the following steps: 1) we compare the column densities ofeach kinematic component measured in the 2001 stis data with those measured inthe 2009 cos data; 2) we use time-dependent photionization calculations with aset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogennumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ioniccolumn densities; 3) from the upper limit on the number density, we calculate alower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via theprior determination of the ionization parameter. our method offers twoimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. first, we account for thephysical behavior of agn lightcurves. second, our analysis accounts for thequality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorptiontroughs. the very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostlyconsistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to putstatistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the majoruv absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. these results are mainlyconsistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warmabsorbers from the simultaneous x-ray spectra.

1301.1612	ism composition through x-ray spectroscopy of lmxbs	the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) is an integral part of the evolution ofthe entire galaxy. metals are produced by stars and their abundances are thedirect testimony of the history of stellar evolution. however, the interstellardust composition is not well known and the total abundances are yet to beaccurately determined. we probe ism dust composition, total abundances, andabundance gradients through the study of interstellar absorption features inthe high-resolution x-ray spectra of galactic low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs).we use high-quality grating spectra of nine lmxbs taken with xmm-newton. wemeasure the column densities of o, ne, mg, and fe with an empirical model andestimate the galactic abundance gradients. the column densities of the neutralgas species are in agreement with those found in the literature. solids are asignificant reservoir of metals like oxygen and iron. respectively, 15-25 % and65-90 % of the total amount of o i and fe i is found in dust. the dust amountand mixture seem to be consistent along all the lines-of-sight (los). ourestimates of abundance gradients and predictions of local interstellarabundances are in agreement with those measured at longer wavelengths. our workshows that x-ray spectroscopy is a very powerful method to probe the ism. forinstance, on a large scale the ism appears to be chemically homogeneous showingsimilar gas ionization ratios and dust mixtures. the agreement between theabundances of the ism and the stellar objects suggests that the local galaxy isalso chemically homogeneous.

1307.8123	modeling the interaction of thermonuclear supernova remnants with  circumstellar structures: the case of tycho's supernova remnant	the well-established type ia remnant of tycho's supernova (sn 1572) revealsdiscrepant ambient medium density estimates based on either the measureddynamics or on the x-ray emission properties. this discrepancy can potentiallybe solved by assuming that the supernova remnant (snr) shock initially movedthrough a stellar wind bubble, but is currently evolving in the uniforminterstellar medium with a relatively low density.  we investigate this scenario by combining hydrodynamical simulations of thewind-loss phase and the supernova remnant evolution with a coupled x-rayemission model, which includes non-equilibrium ionization. for the explosionmodels we use the well-known w7 deflagration model and the delayed detonationmodel that was previously shown to provide good fits to the x-ray emission oftycho's snr.  our simulations confirm that a uniform ambient density cannot simultaneouslyreproduce the dynamical and x-ray emission properties of tycho. in contrast,models that considered that the remnant was evolving in a dense, but small,wind bubble reproduce reasonably well both the measured x-ray emission spectrumand the expansion parameter of tycho's snr. finally, we discuss possible massloss scenarios in the context of single- and double-degenerate models whichpossible could form such a small dense wind bubble.

1412.1171	astro-h white paper - agn winds	in this white paper we describe the prospects for astro-h for the study ofoutflows from active galactic nuclei. the most important breakthroughs in thisfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivityin the fe-k band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full x-ray bandand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. the sensitivity in the fe-kregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow outto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with currentx-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. due tothe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitiveproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise theirphysical properties in great detail. these ultra-fast outflows carry very largeamounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedbackstudies. we show how the astro-h observations in general can help to constrainnumerical models for outflows. the link to reflection and emission processes isalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows andrelativistic emission lines. finally, we discuss the prospects for otherrelated categories of objects like bal quasars, partially covered sources andcompton thick outflows.

1505.06034	line absorption of he-like triplet lines by li-like ions. caveats of  using line ratios of triplets for plasma diagnostics	he-like ions produce distinctive series of triplet lines under variousastrophysical conditions. however, this emission can be affected by lineabsorption from li-like ions in the same medium. we investigate this absorptionof he-like triplets and present the implications for diagnostics of plasmas inphotoionisation equilibrium using the line ratios of the triplets. ourcomputations were carried out for the o vi and fe xxiv absorption of the o viiand fe xxv triplet emission lines, respectively. the fluorescent emission bythe li-like ions and continuum absorption of the he-like ion triplet lines arealso investigated. we determine the absorption of the triplet lines as afunction of li-like ion column density and velocity dispersion of the emittingand absorbing medium. we find o vi line absorption can significantly alter theo vii triplet line ratios in optically-thin plasmas, by primarily absorbing theintercombination lines, and to a lesser extent, the forbidden line. because ofintrinsic line absorption by o vi inside a photoionised plasma, the predictedratio of forbidden to intercombination line intensity for the o vii tripletincreases from 4 up to an upper limit of 16. this process can explain thetriplet line ratios that are higher than expected and that are seen in somex-ray observations of photoionised plasmas. for the fe xxv triplet, lineabsorption by fe xxiv becomes less apparent owing to significant fluorescentemission by fe xxiv. without taking the associated li-like ion line absorptioninto account, the density diagnosis of photoionised plasmas using the observedline ratios of the he-like ion triplet emission lines can be unreliable,especially for low-z ions.

1509.00274	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: v. a clear view of the x-ray narrow  emission lines	context. our consortium performed an extensive multi-wavelength campaign ofthe nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 in 2013-14. the source appeared unusuallyheavily absorbed in the soft x-rays, and signatures of outflowing absorptionwere also present in the uv. he-like triplets of neon, oxygen and nitrogen, andradiative recombination continuum (rrc) features were found to dominate thesoft x-ray spectrum due to the low continuum flux.  aims. here we focus on characterising these narrow emission features usingdata obtained from the xmm-newton rgs (770 ks stacked spectrum).  methods. we use spex for our initial analysis of these features.self-consistent photoionisation models from cloudy are then compared with thedata to characterise the physical conditions of the emitting region.  results. outflow velocity discrepancies within the o vii triplet lines can beexplained if the x-ray narrow-line region (nlr) in ngc 5548 is absorbed by atleast one of the six warm absorber components found by previous analyses. therrcs allow us to directly calculate a temperature of the emitting gas of a fewev ($\sim10^{4}$ k), favouring photoionised conditions. we fit the data with acloudy model of log $\xi = 1.45 \pm 0.05$ erg cm s$^{-1}$, log $n_h = 22.9 \pm0.4$ cm$^{-2}$ and log v$_{turb} = 2.25 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ for the emittinggas; this is the first time the x-ray nlr gas in this source has been modelledso comprehensively. this allows us to estimate the distance from the centralsource to the illuminated face of the emitting clouds as $13.9 \pm 0.6$ pc,consistent with previous work.

1511.07169	discovery of a fast, broad, transient outflow in ngc 985	we observed the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 985 on multiple occasions to search forvariability in its uv and x-ray absorption features in order to establish theirlocation and physical properties. we use xmm-newton to obtain x-ray spectrausing the epic-pn camera, and the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) on thehubble space telescope (hst) to obtain uv spectra. our observations aresimultaneous and span timescales of days to years. we find that the soft x-rayobscuration that absorbed the low energy continuum of ngc 985 in august 2013diminished greatly by january 2015. the total x-ray column density decreasedfrom 2.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 to ~6 x 10^21 cm^-2. we also detect broad, fast uvabsorption lines in cos spectra obtained during the 2013 obscuration event.lines of c iii*, ly alpha, si iv and c iv with outflow velocities of -5970 km/sand a full-width at half-maximum of 1420 km/s are prominent in the 2013spectrum, but have disappeared in all but ly alpha in the 2015 spectra. theionization state and the column density of the uv absorbing gas is compatiblewith arising in the same gas as that causing the x-ray obscuration. the highvelocity of the uv-absorbing gas suggests that the x-ray obscurer and theassociated uv outflow are manifestations of an accretion disk wind.

astro-ph;0010606	cassiopeia a: on the origin of the hard x-ray continuum and the  implication of the observed o viii ly-alpha/ly-beta distribution	we present the first results on the hard x-ray continuum image (up to 15 kev)of the supernova remnant cas a measured with the epic cameras onboardxmm-newton. the data indicate that the hard x-ray tail, observed previously,that extends to energies above 100 kev does not originate in localised regions,like the bright x-ray knots and filaments or the primary blast wave, but isspread over the whole remnant with a rather flat hardness ratio of the 8-10 and10-15 kev energy bands. this result does not support an interpretation of thehard x-radiation as synchrotron emission produced in the primary shock, inwhich case a limb brightened shell of hard x-ray emission close to the primaryshock front is expected. in fact a weak rim of emission near the primary shockfront is discernable in the hardest x-ray image but it contains only a fewpercent of the hard x-ray emissivity. the equivalent width of the fe-k lineblend varies by more than an order of magnitude over the remnant, it is hard toexplain this as fe-emission from the reverse shock heated ejecta given theejecta temperature and the age of the remnant. the uniquely highwavelength-dispersive rgs-spectrometer has allowed, for the first time, toextract monochromatic images in several highly ionised element species withhigh spectral resolution. we present here a preliminary result on themeasurement of the o viii ly-alpha and ly-beta brightness distribution andbrightness ratios. the large observed decrease of the ly-alpha/ly-beta ratiogoing from the n to the se can be explained by small-scale (10 arcsec)variations in the n_h column over the remnant and the potential presence ofresonance scattering of the o viii ly-alpha photons in the limb brightenedshell.

(2001)as evidence for the existence of relativistically broadened lyman alphaemission from carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, produced in the inner-most regionsof an accretion disk around a kerr black hole. this suggestion was subsequentlycriticized in a paper by lee et al. (2001), who argued that for mcg-6-30-15,the chandra hetg spectrum, which is partially overlapping the rgs in spectralcoverage, is adequately fit by a dusty warm absorber model, with norelativistic line emission. we present a reanalysis of the original rgs datasets in terms of the lee et al. (2001) model, and demonstrate that spectralmodels consisting of a smooth continuum with ionized and dust absorption alonecannot reproduce the rgs spectra of both objects. the original relativisticline model with warm absorption proposed by branduardi-raymont et al. (2001)provides a superior fit to the rgs data, both in the overall shape of thespectrum and in the discrete absorption lines. limits on the amount of x-rayabsorption by dust particles are discussed. we also discuss a possibletheoretical interpretation for the putative relativistic lyman alpha lineemission in terms of the photoionized surface layers of the inner regions of anaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0210662	high resolution x-ray spectroscopic constraints on cooling-flow models  for clusters of galaxies	we present high resolution x-ray spectra of 14 putative cooling-flow clustersof galaxies obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer on xmm-newton.the clusters in the sample span a large range of temperatures and massdeposition rates. various of these spectra exhibit line emission from o viii,ne x, mg xii &amp; xi, al xiii &amp; xii, si xiv &amp; xiii, n vii, and c vi as well as allfe l ions. the spectra exhibit strong emission from cool plasma at just belowthe ambient temperature, $t_0$, down to $t_0/2$, but also exhibit a severedeficit of emission, relative to the predictions of the isobaric cooling-flowmodel at lower temperatures ($&lt;$ $t_0/3$). in addition, the best-resolvedspectra show emission throughout the entire x-ray temperature range, butincreasingly less emission at lower temperatures than the cooling-flow modelwould predict. these results are difficult to reconcile with simpleprescriptions for distorting the emission measure distribution, e.g. byincluding additional heating or rapid cooling terms. we enumerate sometheoretical difficulties in understanding the soft x-ray spectra ofcooling-flows independent of the classic problem of the failure to detect thecooling-flow sink. empirically, the differential luminosity distribution isconsistent with being proportional to the temperature to the power of $\approx$1 to 2, instead of being independent of the temperature, as expected in thestandard multi-phase model. the primary differences in the observed lowtemperature spectra are ascribed to differences in the ambient temperature.

astro-ph;0210665	high resolution x-ray spectroscopic constraints on cooling flow models  of clusters of galaxies and gaseous haloes around elliptical galaxies	in many clusters of galaxies, the cooling time at the core of theintracluster medium is much less than the age of the system, suggesting thatthe the gas should continually lose energy by radiation. simple thermodynamicarguments then require that the expected "cooling flow" should exhibit aspecific spectroscopic signature, characterized by a differential emissionmeasure distribution that is inversely proportional to the cooling function ofthe plasma. that prediction can be quantitatively tested for the first time bythe reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) experiment on xmm-newton, whichprovides high resolution x-ray spectra, even for moderately extended sourceslike clusters. we present rgs data on 14 separate cooling flow clusters,sampling a very wide range in mass deposition rate. surprisingly, in all caseswe find a systematic deficit of low temperature emission relative to thepredictions of the cooling flow models. however, we do see evidence for coolingflow gas at temperatures just below the cluster background temperature, $t_0$,roughly down to $t_0/2$. these results are difficult to reconcile with most ofthe possible explanations for the cooling flow problem that have been proposedto date. we also present rgs data on the massive elliptical galaxy ngc 4636. inthis case, we detect evidence for resonance emission line scattering of highoscillator strength fe l-shell emission lines within the gaseous halo of thegalaxy. the detection of that effect leads to very tight constraints onphysical conditions within the halo. however, here again, the expectedsignature of a cooling flow is not detected, perhaps suggesting somefundamental uncertainty in our understanding of radiative cooling in lowdensity cosmic plasmas.

astro-ph;0210684	xmm-newton confirmation of soft x-ray excess emission in clusters of  galaxies - the discovery of o vii emission from an extended warm baryonic  component	we investigate a sample of 14 clusters of galaxies observed with xmm-newtonin a search for soft x-ray excess emission. in five of these clusters asignificant soft excess is evident. this soft x-ray excess is compared with thethermal emission from both the hot intracluster gas and any cooling (flow) gasthat may be present. a warm (kt=0.2 kev), extended (several mpc), plasmacomponent is particularly clear in the outer parts of the cluster, where thenormal cluster x-ray emission is weak. this warm component causes both athermal soft x-ray excess at low energies (below 0.4-0.5 kev), as well as o viiline emission with a redshift consistent with a cluster origin, and not easilyinterpreted as galactic foreground emission. the intensity of this component iscommensurate with what has been measured before with the rosat pspc in the 1/4kev band. we attribute this component to emission from intercluster filamentsof the warm-hot intergalactic medium in the vicinity of these clusters. for thecentral regions of clusters the detection of lines in the soft x-ray spectrumis more difficult, due to the predominance of the x-ray emitting hot plasmathere, hence we cannot discriminate between the thermal and nonthermal originof the soft excess, leaving several options open. these include thermalemission from warm filaments seen in projection in front of or behind thecluster center, thermal or nonthermal emission in the cluster core itselfrelated to magnetic reconnection, or inverse compton emission from the cosmicmicrowave background on relativistic electrons.

astro-ph;0211403	the soft x-ray spectrum from ngc 1068 observed with letgs on chandra	using the combined spectral and spatial resolving power of the low energytransmission grating (letgs) on board chandra, we obtain separate spectra fromthe bright central source of ngc 1068 (primary region), and from a fainterbright spot 4" to the ne (secondary region). both spectra are dominated by lineemission from h- and he-like ions of c through s, and from fe l-shell ions, butalso include narrow radiative recombination continua, indicating that most ofthe soft x-ray emission arises in low-temperature (kt few ev) photoionizedplasma. we confirm the conclusions of kinkhabwala et al. (2002), based onxmm-newton rgs observations, that the entire nuclear spectrum can be explainedby recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization, and radiativedecay following photoexcitation, with no evidence for hot, collisionallyionized plasma. in addition, this model also provides an excellent fit to thespectrum of the secondary region, albeit with radial column densities a factorof three lower, as would be expected given its distance from the source of theionizing continuum. the remarkable overlap and kinematical agreement of theoptical and x-ray line emission, coupled with the need for a distribution ofionization parameter to explain the x-ray spectra, collectively imply thepresence of a distribution of densities (over a few orders of magnitude) ateach radius in the ionization cone. relative abundances of all elements areconsistent with solar abundance, except for n, which is 2-3 times solar. thelong wavelength spectrum beyond 30 a is rich of l-shell transitions of mg, si,s, and ar, and m-shell transitions of fe. the velocity dispersion decreaseswith increasing ionization parameter, as deduced from these long wavelengthlines and the fe-l shell lines.

astro-ph;0512401	xmm-newton spectroscopy of the cluster of galaxies 2a 0335+096	we present here the results of a deep (130 ks) xmm-newton observation of thecluster of galaxies 2a 0335+096. the deep exposure allows us to study in detailits temperature structure and its elemental abundances. we fit three differentthermal models and find that the multi-temperature wdem model fits our databest. we find that the abundance structure of the cluster is consistent with ascenario where the relative number of type ia supernovae contributing to theenrichment of the intra-cluster medium is ~25%, while the relative number ofcore collapse supernovae is ~75%. comparison of the observed abundances to thesupernova yields does not allow us to put any constrains on the contribution ofpop iii stars to the enrichment of the icm. radial abundance profiles show astrong central peak of both type ia and core collapse supernova products. boththe temperature and iron abundance maps show an asymmetry in the direction ofthe elongated morphology of the surface brightness. in particular thetemperature map shows a sharp change over a brightness edge on the southernside of the core, which was identified as a cold front in the chandra data.this suggests that the cluster is in the process of a merger with a subcluster.moreover, we find that the blobs or filaments discovered in the core of thecluster by chandra are, contrary to the previous results, colder than theambient gas and they appear to be in pressure equilibrium with theirenvironment.

astro-ph;0602582	chemical evolution in sersic 159-03 observed with xmm-newton	using a new long x-ray observation of the cluster of galaxies sersic 159-03with xmm-newton, we derive radial temperature and abundance profiles usingsingle- and multi-temperature models. the fits to the epic and rgs spectraprefer multi-temperature models especially in the core. the radial profiles ofoxygen and iron measured with epic/rgs and the line profiles in rgs suggestthat there is a dip in the o/fe ratio in the centre of the cluster compared toits immediate surroundings. a possible explanation for the large scalemetallicity distribution is that snia and snii products are released in the icmthrough ram-pressure stripping of in-falling galaxies. this causes a peakedmetallicity distribution. in addition, snia in the central cd galaxy enrichmainly the centre of the cluster with iron. this excess of snia products isconsistent with the low o/fe ratio we detect in the centre of the cluster. wefit the abundances we obtain with yields from snia, snii and population-iiistars to derive the clusters chemical evolution. we find that the measuredabundance pattern does not require a population-iii star contribution. therelative contribution of the number of snia with respect to the total number ofsne which enrich the icm is about 25-50%. furthermore, we discuss the possiblepresence of a non-thermal component in the epic spectra. a potential source ofthis non-thermal emission can be inverse-compton scattering between cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) photons and relativistic electrons, which areaccelerated in bow shocks associated with ram-pressure stripping of in-fallinggalaxies.

astro-ph;0604519	the o vii x-ray forest toward markarian 421: consistency between  xmm-newton and chandra	recently the first detections of highly ionised gas associated with twowarm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) filaments have been reported. the evidenceis based on x-ray absorption lines due to o vii and other ions observed bychandra towards the bright blazar mrk 421. we investigate the robustness ofthis detection by a re-analysis of the original chandra letgs spectra, theanalysis of a large set of xmm-newton rgs spectra of mrk 421, and additionalchandra observations. we address the reliability of individual spectralfeatures belonging to the absorption components, and assess the significance ofthe detection of these components. we also use monte carlo simulations ofspectra. we confirm the apparent strength of several features in the chandraspectra, but demonstrate that they are statistically not significant. thisdecreased significance is due to the number of redshift trials that are madeand that are not taken into account in the original discovery paper. thereforethese features must be attributed to statistical fluctuations. this isconfirmed by the rgs spectra, which have a higher signal to noise ratio thanthe chandra spectra, but do not show features at the same wavelengths. finally,we show that the possible association with a ly-alpha absorption system alsolacks sufficient statistical evidence. we conclude that there is insufficientobservational proof for the existence of the two proposed whim filamentstowards mrk 421, the brightest x-ray blazar on the sky. therefore, the highlyionised component of the whim still remains to be discovered.

astro-ph;0606021	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy  ngc 4051 with chandra letgs	we study the absorption and emission properties of the photoionised gas nearone of the brightest and most variable agn, the seyfert galaxy ngc 4051, inorder to constrain the geometry, dynamics and ionisation structure of theoutflow. we analyse two observations taken with the low energy transmissiongrating spectrometer (letgs) of chandra. we study the spectra of bothobservations and investigate the spectral response to a sudden, long-lastingflux decrease of a factor of 5 that occurred during the second observation. weconfirm the preliminary detection of a highly ionised component with an outflowvelocity of -4500 km/s, one of the highest velocity outflow components seen ina seyfert 1 galaxy. the sudden drop in intensity by a factor of five during thesecond observation causes a drop in ionisation parameter of a similar magnitudein the strongest and main ionisation component (v = -610 km/s), allowing us forthe first time to determine the recombination time of this component andthereby its distance in a robust way. we find an upper limit to the distance of10^15 m, ruling out an origin in the narrow emission line region. in addition,an emission component producing strong radiative recombination continua of c viand c v appears during the low state. this can be explained by emission from anionised skin of the accretion disk at a distance of only ~4x10^12 m from theblack hole. finally, the spectra contain a broad relativistic o viii line withproperties similar to what was found before in this source with xmm-newton;this line has disappeared during the low flux state, consistent with thedisappearance of the inner part of the accretion disk during that low fluxstate.

astro-ph;0608177	xmm-newton high-resolution spectroscopy reveals the chemical evolution  of m 87	we present here a study of chemical abundances in the giant elliptical galaxym 87 using high-resolution spectra obtained with the reflection gratingspectrometers during two deep xmm-newton observations. while we confirm thetwo-temperature structure of the inter-stellar medium (ism) in m 87, we alsoshow that a continuous temperature distribution describes the data equallywell. the high statistics allows us, for the first time, to determinerelatively accurate abundance values also for carbon and nitrogen. thecomparison of the abundance ratios of c, n, o and fe in the ism of m 87 withthose in the stellar population of our galaxy shows that the relativecontribution of core-collapse supernovae to the enrichment of the ism in m 87is significantly less than in the milky way and indicates that the enrichmentof the ism by iron through type ia supernovae and by carbon and nitrogen isoccurring in parallel. this suggests that the main source of carbon andnitrogen in m 87 are the low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branchstars. from the oxygen to iron abundance ratio in the hot gas we estimate thatthe relative number of core collapse and type ia supernovae contributing to theenrichment of the ism in the core of m 87 is ~60% and ~40% respectively. thespatial distributions of iron and oxygen are different. while the oxygenabundance distribution is flat the iron abundance peaks in the core and has agradient throughout the ~4' wide field of view of the instrument, suggesting anearly enrichment by core-collapse supernovae and a continuous contribution oftype ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0609385	x-ray/ultraviolet observing campaign of the markarian 279 active  galactic nucleus outflow: a close look at the absorbing/emitting gas with  chandra-letgs	we present a chandra-letgs observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 279. thisobservation was carried out simultaneously with hst-stis and fuse, in thecontext of a multiwavelength study of this source. the chandra pointings werespread over ten days for a total exposure time of ~360 ks. the spectrum ofmrk279 shows evidence of broad emission features, especially at the wavelengthof the ovii triplet. we quantitatively explore the possibility that thisemission is produced in the broad line region (blr). we modeled the broad uvemission lines seen in the fuse and hst-stis spectra following the ``locallyoptimally emitting cloud" approach. we find that the x-ray lines luminosityderived from the best fit blr model can match the x-ray features, suggestingthat the gas producing the uv lines is sufficient to account also for the x-rayemission. the spectrum is absorbed by ionized gas whose total column density is~5x10^{20} cm^{-2}. the absorption spectrum can be modeled by two distinct gascomponents (log xi ~ 0.47 and 2.49, respectively) both showing a significantoutflow velocity. however, the data allow also the presence of intermediateionization components. the distribution of the column densities of such extracomponents as a function of the ionization parameter is not consistent with acontinuous, power law-like, absorber, suggesting a complex structure for thegas outflow for mrk 279 (abridged).

astro-ph;0701553	constraining supernova models using the hot gas in clusters of galaxies	the hot intra-cluster medium (icm) in clusters of galaxies is a very largerepository of metals produced by supernovae. we aim to accurately measure theabundances in the icm of many clusters and compare these data with metal yieldsproduced by supernovae. using the data archive of the xmm-newton x-rayobservatory, we compile a sample of 22 clusters. we fit spectra extracted fromthe core regions and determine the abundances of silicon, sulfur, argon,alcium, iron, and nickel. the abundances from the spectral fits aresubsequently fitted to supernova yields determined from several supernova typeia and core-collapse supernova models. we find that the argon and calciumabundances cannot be fitted with currently favoured supernova type ia models.we obtain a major improvement of the fit, when we use an empirically modifieddelayed-detonation model that is calibrated on the tycho supernova remnant. thetwo modified parameters are the density where the sound wave in the supernovaturns into a shock and the ratio of the specific internal energies of ions andelectrons at the shock. our fits also suggest that the core-collapse supernovaethat contributed to the enrichment of the icm had progenitors which werealready enriched. the ar/ca ratio in clusters is a good touchstone fordetermining the quality of type ia models. the core-collapse contribution,which is about 50% and not strongly dependent on the imf or progenitormetallicity, does not have a significant impact on the ar/ca ratio. the numberratio between supernova type ia and core-collapse supernovae suggests thatbinary systems in the appropriate mass range are very efficient (~ 5-16%) ineventually forming supernova type ia explosions.

astro-ph;0702311	the mass-energy budget of the ionised outflow in ngc 7469	although agn feedback through ionised winds is of great importance in modelsof agn/galaxy coevolution, the mass and energy output via these winds, even inthe nearby universe, is poorly understood. the issue is complicated by the widerange of ionisation in the winds, which means that multiwavelengthobservational campaigns are required to obtain the complete picture. in thispaper, we use a ~ 160 ks xmm-newton rgs spectrum to get the most accurate viewyet of the ionised outflow (warm absorber) in ngc 7469 as seen in x-rays,finding that there is a wide range of ionisation, with log xi in the range ~0.5-3.5 erg cm s^-1, and two main velocity regimes, at 580-720 and 2300 kms^-1, with the highest velocity gas being the least ionised. the totalabsorbing column density in the x-rays is of order 3 x 10^21 cm^-2. we findthat the lowest ionisation phase of the absorber is probably identical with oneof the phases of the uv absorber discovered in previous studies. we show thatboth x-ray and uv absorbers are consistent with an origin near the base of atorus wind, where matter is being launched and accelerated. calculating themass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of all the absorber phases, wedemonstrate that the x-ray absorbing gas carries respectively ~ 90% and 95% ofthe mass and kinetic energy output of the ionised outflow.

0809.2613	chemical enrichment in the cluster of galaxies hydra a	we analyzed global properties, radial profiles and 2d maps of the metalabundances and temperature in the cool core cluster of galaxies hydra a using adeep xmm-newton exposure. the best fit among the available spectral models isprovided by a gaussian distribution of the emission measure (gdem). we canaccurately determine abundances for 7 elements in the cluster core with epicand 3 elements with rgs. the gdem model gives lower fe abundances than a singletemperature model. the abundance profiles for fe, si, s, but also o arecentrally peaked. combining the hydra a results with 5 other clusters for whichdetailed chemical abundance studies are available, we find a significantdecrease of o with radius, while the increase in the o/fe ratio with radius issmall within 0.1 r_200. we compare the observed abundance ratios with themixing of various supernova type ia and core-collapse yield models in differentrelative amounts. producing the estimated o, si and s peaks in hydra a requireseither an amount of metals ejected by stellar winds 3-8 times higher thanpredicted by available models or a remaining peak in the enrichment bycore-collapse supernovae from the protocluster phase. the temperature map showscooler gas extending in arm-like structures towards the north and south. thesestructures appear to be richer in metals than the ambient medium and spatiallycorrelated with the large-scale radio lobes. we estimate the mass of cool gas,which was probably uplifted by buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma producedby the agn, to 1.6-6.1x10^9 m_sun, and the energy associated with this upliftto 3.3-12.5x10^58 ergs. the best estimate of the mass of fe uplifted togetherwith the cool gas is 1.7x10^7 m_sun, 15% of the total mass of fe in the central0.5arcmin region.
