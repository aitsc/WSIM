0901.0514	hd and h2 formation in low-metallicity dusty gas clouds at high redshift	context: the hd and h2 molecules play important roles in the cooling ofprimordial and very metal-poor gas at high redshift. aims: grain surface andgas phase formation of hd and h2 is investigated to assess the importance oftrace amounts of dust, 10^{-5}-10^{-3} zo, in the production of hd and h2.methods: we consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include bothphysisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surfacebarriers. we find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemicaland thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10^{-5} solar lead to astrong boost in the h2 formation rate due to surface reactions. as a result ofthis enhancement in h2, hd is formed more efficiently in the gas phase throughthe d+ + h2 reaction. direct formation of hd on dust grains cannot compete wellwith this gas phase process for dust temperatures below 150 k. we also deriveup-to-date analytic fitting formulae for the grain surface formation of h2 andhd, including the different binding energies of h and d. results: grain surfacereactions are crucial to the availability of h2 and hd in very metal-poorenvironments. above metallicities of 10^{-5} solar, the grain surface routedominates the formation of h2, which in turn, drives the formation of hd in thegas phase. at dust temperatures above 150 k, laboratory experiments andtheoretical modelling suggest that h2 formation on grains is suppressed whilehd formation on grains is not.

0906.5154	probing x-ray irradiation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 with observations  of high-j lines of dense gas tracers	with the incorporation of high-j molecular lines, we aim to constrain thephysical conditions of the dense gas in the central region of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and to determine signatures of the agn or the starburstcontribution.  we used the james clerk maxwell telescope to observe the j=4-3 transition ofhcn, hnc, and hco+, as well as the cn n_j=2_{5/2}-1_{3/2} andn_j=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in ngc 1068.  we estimate the excitation conditions of hcn, hnc, and cn, based on the lineintensity ratios and radiative transfer models.  we find that the bulk emission of hcn, hnc, cn, and the high-j hco+ emergefrom dense gas n(h_2)&gt;=10^5 cm^-3). however, the low-j hco+ lines (dominatingthe hco+ column density) trace less dense (n(h_2)&lt;10^5 cm^-3) and colder(t_k&lt;=20 k) gas, whereas the high-j hco+ emerges from warmer (&gt;30 k) gas thanthe other molecules.  the hco+ j=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines andwith the hcn j=4-3 line, support the influence of a local xdr environment. theestimated n(cn)/n(hcn)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an xdr/agnenvironment with a possible contribution of grain-surface chemistry induced byx-rays or shocks.

0910.4937	champ+ observations of warm gas in m17 sw	since the main cooling lines of the gas phase are important tracers of theinterstellar medium in galactic and extragalactic sources, proper and detailedunderstanding of their emission, and the ambient conditions of the emittinggas, is necessary for a robust interpretation of the observations. with highresolution (7"-9") maps (~3x3 pc^2) of mid-j molecular lines we aim to probethe physical conditions and spatial distribution of the warm (50 to few hundredk) and dense gas (n(h_2)&gt;10^5 cm^-3) across the interface region of m17 swnebula. we have used the dual color multiple pixel receiver champ+ on apextelescope to obtain a 5'.3x4'.7 map of the j=6-5 and j=7-6 transitions of 12co,the 13co j=6-5 line, and the {^3p_2}-{^3p_1} 370 um fine-structure transitionof [c i] in m17 sw. lte and non-lte radiative transfer models are used toconstrain the ambient conditions. the warm gas extends up to a distance of ~2.2pc from the m17 sw ridge. the 13co j=6-5 and [c i] 370 um lines have a narrowerspatial extent of about 1.3 pc along a strip line at p.a=63 deg. the structureand distribution of the [c i] {^3p_2}-{^3p_1} 370 um map indicate that itsemission arises from the interclump medium with densities of the order of 10^3cm^-3. the warmest gas is located along the ridge of the cloud, close to theionization front. an lte approximation indicates that the excitationtemperature of the embedded clumps goes up to ~120 k. the non-lte modelsuggests that the kinetic temperature at four selected positions cannot exceed230 k in clumps of density n(h_2)~5x10^5 cm^-3, and that the warm t_k&gt;100 k anddense (n(h_2)&gt;10^4 cm^-3) gas traced by the mid-j 12co lines represent justabout 2% of the bulk of the molecular gas. the clump volume filling factorranges between 0.04 and 0.11 at these positions.

0911.5122	the thermodynamics of molecular cloud fragmentation: star formation  under non-milky way conditions	properties of candidate stars, forming out of molecular clouds, depend on theambient conditions of the parent cloud. we present a series of 2d and 3dsimulations of fragmentation of molecular clouds in starburst regions as wellas clouds under conditions in dwarf galaxies, leading to the formation ofprotostellar cores. we explore in particular the metallicity dependence ofmolecular cloud fragmentation and the possible variations in the dense coremass function, as the expression of a multi-phase ism, due to dynamic andthermodynamic effects in starburst and metal-poor environments. to study thelevel of fragmentation during the collapse, the adaptive mesh refinement codeflash is used. with this code, including self-gravity, thermal balance,turbulence and shocks, collapse is simulated with four different metallicitydependent cooling functions. turbulent and rotational energies are consideredas well. during the simulations, number densities of 10^8-10^9 cm^-3 arereached. the influences of dust and cosmic ray heating are investigated and acomparison to isothermal cases is made. the presented results indicate thatfragmentation increases with metallicity, while cosmic ray and gas-graincollisional heating counteract this. we also find that modest rotation andturbulence can impact the cloud evolution as far as fragmentation is concerned.in this light, we conclude that radiative feedback, in starburst regions, willinhibit fragmentation, while low-metallicity dwarfs also should enjoy a starformation mode in which fragmentation is suppressed.

1003.4695	a new condition for the transition from runaway to oligarchic growth	accretion among macroscopic bodies of ~km size or larger is enhancedsignificantly due to gravitational focusing. two regimes can be distinguished.initially, the system experiences runaway growth, in which the gravitationalfocusing factors increase, and bodies at the high-mass tail of the distributiongrow fastest. however, at some point the runaway body dynamically heats itsenvironment, gravitational focusing factors decrease, and runaway growth passesinto oligarchic growth. based on the results of recent simulations, wereconsider the runaway growth-oligarchy transition. in contrast to oligarchy,we find that runaway growth cannot be approximated with a two component model(of small and large bodies) and that the criterion of ida &amp; makino (1993),which is frequently adopted as the start of oligarchy, is not a sufficientcondition to signify the transition. instead, we propose a new criterion basedon timescale arguments. we then find a larger value for the runawaygrowth-oligarchy transition: from several hundreds of km in the inner diskregions up to ~10^3 km for the outer disk. these findings are consistent withthe view that runaway growth has been responsible for the size distribution ofthe present day kuiper belt objects. our finding furthermore outlines theproper initial conditions at the start of the oligarchy stage.

1004.2413	evolution of the ism in luminous ir galaxies	molecules that trace the high-density regions of the interstellar medium maybe used to evaluate the changing physical and chemical environment during theongoing nuclear activity in (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. the changingratios of the hcn(1-0), hnc(1-0), hco+(1-0), cn(1-0) and cn(2-1), and cs(3-2)transitions were compared with the hcn(1-0)/co(1-0) ratio, which is proposed torepresent the progression time scale of the starburst. these diagnosticdiagrams were interpreted using the results of theoretical modeling using alarge physical and chemical network to describe the state of the nuclear ism inthe evolving galaxies. systematic changes are seen in the line ratios as thesources evolve from early stage for the nuclear starburst (ulirgs) to laterstages. these changes result from changing environmental conditions andparticularly from the lowering of the average density of the medium. atemperature rise due to mechanical heating of the medium by feedback explainsthe lowering of the ratios at later evolutionary stages. infrared pumping mayaffect the cn and hnc line ratios during early evolutionary stages. moleculartransitions display a behavior that relates to changes of the environmentduring an evolving nuclear starburst. molecular properties may be used todesignate the evolutionary stage of the nuclear starburst. the hcn(1-0)/co(1-0)and hco+(1-0)/hcn(1-0) ratios serve as indicators of the time evolution of theoutburst.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1006.3186	accretion among preplanetary bodies: the many faces of runaway growth	(abridged) when preplanetary bodies reach proportions of ~1 km or larger insize, their accretion rate is enhanced due to gravitational focusing (gf). wehave developed a new numerical model to calculate the collisional evolution ofthe gravitationally-enhanced growth stage. we validate our approach againstexisting n-body and statistical codes. using the numerical model, we explorethe characteristics of the runaway growth and the oligarchic growth accretionphases starting from an initial population of single planetesimal radius r_0.in models where the initial random velocity dispersion (as derived from theireccentricity) starts out below the escape speed of the planetesimal bodies, thesystem experiences runaway growth. we find that during the runaway growth phasethe size distribution remains continuous but evolves into a power-law at thehigh mass end, consistent with previous studies. furthermore, we find that thelargest body accretes from all mass bins; a simple two component approximationis inapplicable during this stage. however, with growth the runaway body stirsup the random motions of the planetesimal population from which it isaccreting. ultimately, this feedback stops the fast growth and the systempasses into oligarchy, where competitor bodies from neighboring zones catch upin terms of mass. compared to previous estimates, we find that the systemleaves the runaway growth phase at a somewhat larger radius. furthermore, weassess the relevance of small, single-size fragments on the growth process. inclassical models, where the initial velocity dispersion of bodies is small,these do not play a critical role during the runaway growth; however, in modelsthat are characterized by large initial relative velocities due to externalstirring of their random motions, a situation can emerge where fragmentsdominate the accretion.

1009.6108	the impact of lyman alpha trapping on the formation of primordial  objects	numerous cosmological simulations have been performed to study the formationof the first objects. we present the results of high resolution 3-dcosmological simulations of primordial objects formation using the adaptivemesh refinement code flash by including in an approximate manner the radiativetransfer effects of lyman alpha photons. we compare the results of a lymanalpha trapping case inside gas clouds with atomic and molecular hydrogencooling cases.the principal objective of this research is to follow thecollapse of a zero metallicity halo with an effective equation of state (thataccounts for the trapping) and to explore the fate of a halo in each of thethree cases, specifically, the impact of thermodynamics on fragmentation ofhalos.our results show that in the case of lyman alpha trapping, fragmentationis halted and a massive object is formed at the center of a halo. thetemperature of the gas remains well above $10^{4}$ k and the halo is not ableto fragment to stellar masses. in the atomic cooling case, gas collapses intoone or two massive clumps in contrast to the lyman alpha trapping case. for themolecular hydrogen cooling case, gas cools efficiently and fragments.theformation of massive primordial objects is thus strongly dependent on thethermodynamics of the gas. a salient feature of our results is that for theformation of massive objects, e.g. intermediate mass black holes, feedbackeffects are not required to suppress $h_{2}$ cooling, as molecular hydrogen iscollisionally dissociated at temperatures higher than $10^{4}$ k as aconsequence of lyman alpha trapping.

1102.0218	lyman alpha emission from the first galaxies: signatures of accretion  and infall in the presence of line trapping	the formation of the first galaxies is accompanied by large accretion flowsand virialization shocks, during which the gas is shock-heated to temperaturesof $\sim10^4$ k, leading to potentially strong fluxes in the lyman alpha line.indeed, a number of lyman alpha blobs has been detected at high redshift. inthis letter, we explore the origin of such lyman alpha emission usingcosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a detailed model of atomichydrogen as a multi-level atom and the effects of line trapping with theadaptive mesh refinement code flash. we see that baryons fall into the centerof a halo through cold streams of gas, giving rise to a lyman alpha luminosityof at least $\rm 10^{44} erg s^{-1}$ at $\rm z=4.7$, similar to observed lymanalpha blobs. we find that a lyman alpha flux of $\rm 5.0\times 10^{-17} ergcm^{-2} s^{-1}$ emerges from the envelope of the halo rather than its center,where the photons are efficiently trapped. such emission can be probed indetail with the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst) and will constitutean important probe of gas infall and accretion.

1106.3428	lyman alpha emission from the first galaxies: implications of uv  backgrounds and the formation of molecules	the lyman alpha line is a robust tracer of high redshift galaxies. we presentestimates of lyman alpha emission from a protogalactic halo illuminated by uvbackground radiation fields with various intensities. for this purpose, weperformed cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with the adaptive meshrefinement code flash, including a detailed network for primordialchemistry,comprising the formation of primordial molecules, a multi-level modelfor the hydrogen atom as well as the photo-ionization and photo-dissociationprocesses in a uv background. we find that the presence of a backgroundradiation field j_21 excites the emission of lyman alpha photons, increasingthe lyman alpha luminosity up to two orders of magnitude. for a halo of \sim10^10 m_sun, we find that a maximum flux of 5 \times 10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 isobtained for j21 \times f_esc = 0.1, where f_esc is the escape fraction of theionizing radiation. depending on the environmental conditions, the flux mayvary by three orders of magnitude. for j_21 \times f_esc &gt; 0.1 the lyman alphaluminosity decreases as the atomic hydrogen abundance becomes rather small. thefluxes derived here can be probed using subaru and the upcoming james webbspace telescope. the emission of lyman alpha photons is extended and comes fromthe envelope of the halo rather than its core. in the center of the halo, linetrapping becomes effective above columns of 10^22 cm^-2 and suppresses theemission of lyman alpha. in addition, cooling by primordial molecules maydecrease the gas temperature in the central region, which further reduces lymanalpha emission. in the central core, h_2 is photo-dissociated for a backgroundflux of j_21 \geq 1000. for weaker radiation fields, i.e. j_21 &lt; 0.1, h_2 andhd cooling are particularly strong in the center of the halo, leading to gastemperatures as low as \sim 100 k.

1107.1984	interstellar ices as witnesses of star formation: selective deuteration  of water and organic molecules unveiled	observations of star forming environments revealed that the abundances ofsome deuterated interstellar molecules are markedly larger than the cosmic d/hratio of 10-5. possible reasons for this pointed to grain surface chemistry.how- ever, organic molecules and water, which are both ice constituents, do notenjoy the same deuteration. for example, deuterated formaldehyde is veryabundant in comets and star forming regions, while deuterated water rarely is.in this article, we explain this selective deuteration by following theformation of ices (using the rate equation method) in translucent clouds, aswell as their evolu- tion as the cloud collapses to form a star. ices startwith the deposition of gas phase co and o onto dust grains. while reaction ofoxygen with atoms (h or d) or molecules (h2) yields h2o (hdo), co only reactswith atoms (h and d) to form h2co (hdco, d2co). as a result, the deuteration offormaldehyde is sensitive to the gas d/h ratio as the cloud undergoesgravitational collapse, while the deuteration of water strongly depends on thedust temperature at the time of ice formation. these results reproduce well thedeuterium fractionation of formaldehyde observed in comets and star formingregions and can explain the wide spread of deuterium fractionation of waterobserved in these environments.

1107.5193	when sticking influences h2 formation	aims. interstellar dust grains, because of their catalytic properties, arecrucial to the formation of h2, the most abundant molecule in the universe. theformation of molecular hydrogen strongly depends on the ability of h atoms tostick on dust grains. in this study we determine the sticking coefficient of hatoms chemisorbed on graphitic surfaces, and estimate its impact on the forma-tion of h2. methods. the sticking probability of h atoms chemisorbed ontographitic surfaces is obtained using a mixed classical-quantum dynamics method.in this, the h atom is treated quantum- mechanically and the vibrational modesof the surface are treated classically. the implications of sticking for theformation of h2 are addressed by using kinetic monte carlo simulations thatfollow how atoms stick, move and associate with each other on dust surfaces ofdifferent temper- ature. results. in our model, molecular hydrogen forms veryefficiently for dust temperatures lower than 15 k through the involvement ofphysisorbed h atoms. at dust temperatures higher than 15 k and gas temperatureslower than 2000 k, h2 formation differs strongly if the h atoms com- ing fromthe gas phase have to cross a square barrier (usually considered in previousstudies) or a barrier obtained by dft calculations to become chemisorbed. theproduct of sticking times efficiency can be increased by many orders ofmagnitude when realistic barriers are considered. if graphite phonons are takeninto account in the dynamics calculations, then h atoms stick better on thesurface at high energies, but the overall h2 formation efficiency is onlyslightly affected. our results suggest that h2 formation can proceedefficiently in photon dominated regions, x-ray dominated regions, hot cores andin the early universe when the first dust is available.

1109.6593	star formation near an obscured agn: variations in the initial mass  function	the conditions that affect the formation of stars in radiatively andmechanically active environments are quite different than the conditions thatapply to our local interstellar neighborhood. in such galactic environments, avariety of feedback processes can play a significant role in shaping theinitial mass function (imf). here, we present a numerical study on the effectsof an accreting black hole and the influence of nearby massive stars to acollapsing, 800 m_sun, molecular cloud at 10 pc distance from the black hole.we parametrize and study radiative feedback effects of hard x-rays emanatingfrom the black hole broad line region, increased cosmic ray rates due tosupernovae in starbursts, and strong uv radiation produced by nearby massivestars. we also investigate the importance of shear from the supermassive,10^6-10^8 m_sun, black hole as the star-forming cloud orbits around it. we findthat thermal pressure from x-rays compresses the cloud, which induces a highstar formation rate early on, but reduces the overall star formation efficiencyto about 7% due to gas depletion by evaporation. we see that the turn-over massof the imf increases up to a factor of 2.3, m_turn = 1-1.5 m_sun, for the modelwith the highest x-ray flux (160 erg s^-1 cm^-2), while the high-mass slope ofthe imf becomes gamma &gt; -1. this results in more high mass stars and anon-salpeter imf. cosmic rays penetrate deeply into the cloud and increase thegas temperature (50-200 k), which leads to a reduced formation efficiency oflow mass stars. high cosmic ray rates increase the average mass of stars,thereby shifting the turn-over mass to higher values, i.e., up to several solarmasses. due to this process, the onset of star formation is also delayed. weconclude that the imf inside active galaxies is different than the one obtainedfrom local environments.

1110.4256	the implications of dust for high-redshift protogalaxies and the  formation of binary disks	numerical simulations suggest that the first galaxies are formed inprotogalactic halos with virial temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k. it is likely that suchhalos are polluted with trace amounts of metals produced by the firstgeneration of stars. the presence of dust can significantly change thechemistry and dynamics of early galaxies. in this article, we aim to assess therole of dust on the thermal and dynamical evolution of the first galaxies inthe presence of a background uv flux, and its implications for theobservability of lyman alpha emitters and sub-mm sources. we have performedhigh resolution cosmological simulations using the adaptive mesh refinementcode flash to accomplish this goal. we have developed a chemical networkappropriate for these conditions and coupled it with the flash code. the mainingredients of our chemical model include the formation of molecules, amulti-level treatment of atomic hydrogen, line trapping of lyman alpha photonsand, photoionization and photodissociation processes in a uv background. wefound that the formation of molecules (h_{2} and hd) is significantly enhancedin the presence of dust grains. the presence of a background uv flux stronglyinfluences the formation of molecules by photodissociating them. we explore theevolution after a major merger, leading to the formation of a binary disk.these disks have gas masses of ~10^{7} m_sun at a redshift of 5.4. each disklies in a separate subhalo as a result of the merger event. the disks aresupported by turbulent pressure due to the highly supersonic turbulence presentin the halo. the presence of dust does not significantly reduce the lyman alphaemission. the emission of lyman alpha is extended and originates from theenvelope of the halo due to line trapping effects. we also find that dustmasses of 10^8 m_sun are required to observe the dust continuum emission from z5 galaxies with alma.

1111.2198	enhanced h2o formation through dust grain chemistry in x-ray exposed  environments	the ulirg mrk 231 exhibits very strong water rotational lines between \lambda= 200-670\mu m, comparable to the strength of the co rotational lines. highredshift quasars also show similar co and h2o line properties, while starburstgalaxies, such as m82, lack these very strong h2o lines in the same wavelengthrange, but do show strong co lines. we explore the possibility of enhancing thegas phase h2o abundance in x-ray exposed environments, using bare interstellarcarbonaceous dust grains as a catalyst. cloud-cloud collisions cause c and jshocks, and strip the grains of their ice layers. the internal uv field createdby x-rays from the accreting black hole does not allow to reform the ice. wedetermine formation rates of both oh and h2o on dust grains, having temperaturet_dust=10-60 k, using both monte carlo as well as rate equation methodsimulations. the acquired formation rates are added to our x-ray chemistrycode, that allows us to calculate the thermal and chemical structure of theinterstellar medium near an active galactic nucleus. we derive analyticexpressions for the formation of oh and h2o on bare dust grains as a catalyst.oxygen atoms arriving on the dust are released into the gas phase under theform of oh and h2o. the efficiencies of this conversion due to the chemistryoccurring on dust are of order 30 percent for oxygen converted into oh and 60percent for oxygen converted into h_2o between t_dust=15-40 k. at highertemperatures, the efficiencies rapidly decline. when the gas is mostly atomic,molecule formation on dust is dominant over the gas-phase route, which is thenquenched by the low h2 abundance. here, it is possible to enhance the warm (t&gt;200 k) water abundance by an order of magnitude in x-ray exposed environments.this helps to explain the observed bright water lines in nearby andhigh-redshift ulirgs and quasars.

1203.5058	diagnostics of the molecular component of pdrs with mechanical heating	context. multitransition co observations of galaxy centers have revealed thatsignificant fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetictemperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may becaused by dissipation of turbulent energy.  aims. we aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be takeninto account while modelling pdrs. to this end, the effect of dissipatedturbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of pdrs is explored. methods.clouds are modelled as 1d semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemicalequilibrium is solved for using the leiden pdr-xdr code.  results. in a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating seems to play animportant role in determining the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecularclouds. particularly in high-energy environments such as starburst galaxies andgalaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated by at least a factorof two if mechanical heating is ignored. the models also show that co, hcn andh2 o column densities increase as a function of mechanical heating. the hnc/hcnintegrated column density ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two inhigh density regions with n \sim 105 cm-3, whereas that of hcn/hco+ shows astrong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range, withboosts of up to three orders of magnitude.  conclusions. the effects of mechanical heating cannot be ignored in studiesof the molecular gas excitation whenever the ratio of the star formation rateto the gas density is close to, or exceeds, 7 \times 10-6 m yr-1 cm4.5 . ifmechanical heating is not included, predicted column densities areunderestimated, sometimes even by a few orders of magnitude. as a lower boundto its importance, we determined that it has non-negligible effects alreadywhen mechanical heating is as little as 1% of the uv heating in a pdr.

1204.0390	extended warm and dense gas towards w49a: starburst conditions in our  galaxy?	the star formation rates in starburst galaxies are orders of magnitude higherthan in local star-forming regions, and the origin of this difference is notwell understood. we use sub-mm spectral line maps to characterize the physicalconditions of the molecular gas in the luminous galactic star-forming regionw49a and compare them with the conditions in starburst galaxies. we probe thetemperature and density structure of w49a using h_2co and hcn line ratios overa 2'x2' (6.6x6.6 pc) field with an angular resolution of 15" (~0.8 pc) providedby the jcmt spectral legacy survey. we analyze the rotation diagrams of lineswith multiple transitions with corrections for optical depth and beam dilution,and estimate excitation temperatures and column densities. comparing theobserved line intensity ratios with non-lte radiative transfer models, ourresults reveal an extended region (about 1'x1', equivalent to ~3x3 pc at thedistance of w49a) of warm (&gt; 100 k) and dense (&gt;10^5 cm^-3) molecular gas, witha mass of 2x10^4 - 2x10^5 m_sun (by applying abundances derived for otherregions of massive star-formation). these temperatures and densities in w49aare comparable to those found in clouds near the center of the milky way and instarburst galaxies. the highly excited gas is likely to be heated via shocksfrom the stellar winds of embedded, o-type stars or alternatively due to uvirradiation, or possibly a combination of these two processes. cosmic rays,x-ray irradiation and gas-grain collisional heating are less likely to be thesource of the heating in the case of w49a.

1207.5657	the impact of magnetic fields on the imf in star-forming clouds near a  supermassive black hole	star formation in the centers of galaxies is thought to yield massive starswith a possibly top-heavy stellar mass distribution. it is likely that magneticfields play a crucial role in the distribution of stellar masses insidestar-forming molecular clouds. in this context, we explore the effects ofmagnetic fields, with a typical field strength of 38 microg, such as in rcw 38,and a field strength of 135 microg, similar to ngc 2024 and the infrared darkcloud g28.34+0.06, on the initial mass function (imf) near (&lt; 10 pc) a 10^7solar mass black hole. using these conditions, we perform a series of numericalsimulations with the hydrodynamical code flash to elucidate the impact ofmagnetic fields on the imf and the star-formation efficiency (sfe) emergingfrom an 800 solar mass cloud. we find that the collapse of a gravitationallyunstable molecular cloud is slowed down with increasing magnetic field strengthand that stars form along the field lines. the total number of stars formedduring the simulations increases by a factor of 1.5-2 with magnetic fields. themain component of the imf has a lognormal shape, with its peak shifted tosub-solar (&lt; 0.3 m_sun) masses in the presence of magnetic fields, due to adecrease in the accretion rates from the gas reservoir. in addition, we see atop-heavy, nearly flat imf above ~2 solar masses, from regions that weresupported by magnetic pressure until high masses are reached. we also considerthe effects of x-ray irradiation if the central black hole is active. x-rayfeedback inhibits the formation of sub-solar masses and decreases the sfes evenfurther. thus, the second contribution is no longer visible. we conclude thatmagnetic fields potentially change the sfe and the imf both in active andinactive galaxies, and need to be taken into account in such calculations.

1211.4984	hydrogenation of pah cations: a first step towards h2 formation	molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the universe. a largefraction of h2 forms by association of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), where formation rates depend crucially on the hsticking probability. we have experimentally studied pah hydrogenation byexposing coronene cations, confined in a radiofrequency ion trap, to gas phaseatomic hydrogen. a systematic increase of the number of h atoms adsorbed on thecoronene with the time of exposure is observed. odd coronene hydrogenationstates dominate the mass spectrum up to 11 h atoms attached. this indicates thepresence of a barrier preventing h attachment to these molecular systems. forthe second and fourth hydrogenation, barrier heights of 72 +- 6 mev and 40 +-10 mev, respectively are found which is in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions for the hydrogenation of neutral pahs. our experiments howeverprove that the barrier does not vanish for higher hydrogenation states. theseresults imply that pah cations, as their neutral counterparts, exist in highlyhydrogenated forms in the interstellar medium. due to this catalytic activity,pah cations and neutrals seem to contribute similarly to the formation of h2.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1302.1410	water vapor in the protoplanetary disk of dg tau	water is key in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation ofcomets and icy/water planets. while high excitation water lines originating inthe hot inner disk have been detected in several t tauri stars (ttss), watervapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, wasonly reported in the closeby tts tw hya. we present spectrally resolvedherschel/hifi observations of the young tts dg tau in the ortho- and para-water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 ghz. the lines show a narrowdouble-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are~19-26 times brighter than in tw hya. in contrast, co and [c ii] lines aredominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes h2o lines a uniquetracer of the disk of dg tau. disk modeling with the thermo-chemical codeprodimo indicates that the strong uv field, due to the young age and strongaccretion of dg tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 au from the star,heating it up to temperatures of 600 k and producing the observed bright waterlines. the models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 msun, consistent with theestimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a waterreservoir of ~1e2-1e3 earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the formof ice. hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery onterrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.

1304.2000	the response of metal rich gas to x-ray irradiation from a massive black  hole at high redshift: proof of concept	observational studies show that there is a strong link between the formationand evolution of galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes (smbh) attheir centers. however, the underlying physics of this observed relation ispoorly understood. in order to study the effects of x-ray radiation on thesurroundings of the black hole, we implement x-ray dominated region (xdr)physics into enzo and use the radiation transport module moray to calculate theradiative transfer for a polychromatic spectrum. in this work, we investigatethe effects of x-ray irradiation, produced by a central massive black hole(mbh) with a mass of m = 5x10^4 m_(solar), on ambient gas with solar and zerometallicity. we find that in the solar metallicity case, due to high opacity ofthe metals, the energy deposition rate in the central region (&lt; 20 pc) is highand hence the temperatures in the center are on the order of 10^(5-7) k.moreover, due to the cooling ability and high intrinsic opacity of solarmetallicity gas, column densities of 10^(24) cm^(-2) are reached at a radius of20 pc from the mbh. these column densities are about 3 orders of magnitudeshigher than in the zero metallicity case. furthermore, in the zero metallicitycase an x-ray induced h ii region is formed already after 5.8 myr. this causesa significant outflow of gas (~8x10^6 m_(solar) from the central region, withthe gas reaching outflow velocities up to ~100 km s^(-1). at later times, ~23myr after we insert the mbh, we find that the solar metallicity case alsodevelops an x-ray induced h ii region, but delayed by ~17 myr.

(abbreviated)results. we report new line detections of p-h2o (3_22-2_11) at 89.99 micron andco j=18-17 at 144.78 micron for the disk around tw hya. disk modeling showsthat the far-ir fine structure lines ([oi], [cii]) and molecular submm linesare very robust to uncertainties in the chemistry, while the water line fluxescan change by factors of a few. the water lines are optically thick,sub-thermally excited and can couple to the background continuum radiationfield. the low-excitation water lines are also sensitive to uncertainties inthe collision rates, e.g. with neutral hydrogen. the gas temperature plays animportant role for the [oi] fine structure line fluxes, the water line fluxesoriginating from the inner disk as well as the high excitation co, ch+ and ohlines. conclusions. due to their sensitivity on chemical input data andradiative transfer, water lines have to be used cautiously for understandingdetails of the disk structure. water lines covering a wide range of excitationenergies provide access to the various gas phase water reservoirs (inside andoutside the snow line) in protoplanetary disks and thus provide importantinformation on where gas-phase water is potentially located. experimentaland/or theoretical collision rates for h2o with atomic hydrogen are needed todiminish uncertainties from water line radiative transfer.

1310.8466	the impact of freeze-out on collapsing molecular clouds	atoms and molecules, and in particular co, are important coolants during theevolution of interstellar star-forming gas clouds. the presence of dust grains,which allow many chemical reactions to occur on their surfaces, stronglyimpacts the chemical composition of a cloud. at low temperatures, dust grainscan lock-up species from the gas phase which freeze out and form ices. in thissense, dust can deplete important coolants. our aim is to understand theeffects of freeze-out on the thermal balance and the evolution of agravitationally bound molecular cloud. for this purpose, we perform 3dhydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive mesh code flash. we simulate agravitationally unstable cloud under two different conditions, with and withoutgrain surface chemistry. we let the cloud evolve until one free-fall time isreached and track the thermal evolution and the abundances of species duringthis time. we see that at a number density of 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ most of the comolecules are frozen on dust grains in the run with grain surface chemistry,thereby depriving the most important coolant. as a consequence, we find thatthe temperature of the gas rises up to $\sim$25 k. the temperature drops onceagain due to gas-grain collisional cooling when the density reaches afew$\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. we conclude that grain surface chemistry not onlyaffects the chemical abundances in the gas phase, but also leaves a distinctimprint in the thermal evolution that impacts the fragmentation of astar-forming cloud. as a final step, we present the equation of state of acollapsing molecular cloud that has grain surface chemistry included.

(2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

1404.5773	a uv flux constraint on the formation of direct collapse black holes	the ability of metal free gas to cool by molecular hydrogen in primordialhalos is strongly associated with the strength of ultraviolet (uv) fluxproduced by the stellar populations in the first galaxies. depending on thestellar spectrum, these uv photons can either dissociate $\rm h_{2}$ moleculesdirectly or indirectly by photo-detachment of $\rm h^{-}$ as the latterprovides the main pathway for $\rm h_{2}$ formation in the early universe. inthis study, we aim to determine the critical strength of the uv flux abovewhich the formation of molecular hydrogen remains suppressed for a sample offive distinct halos at $z&gt;10$ by employing a higher order chemical solver and ajeans resolution of 32 cells. we presume that such flux is emitted by popiistars implying atmospheric temperatures of $\rm 10^{4}$~k. we performedthree-dimensional cosmological simulations and varied the strength of the uvflux below the lyman limit in units of $\rm j_{21}$. our findings show that thevalue of $\rm j_{21}^{crit}$ varies from halo to halo and is sensitive to thelocal thermal conditions of the gas. for the simulated halos it varies from400-700 with the exception of one halo where $\rm j_{21}^{crit} \geq 1500$.this has important implications for the formation of direct collapse blackholes and their estimated population at z &gt; 6. it reduces the number density ofdirect collapse black holes by almost three orders of magnitude compared to theprevious estimates.

1405.7706	molecular line emission in ngc1068 imaged with alma. i an agn-driven  outflow in the dense molecular gas	we investigate the fueling and the feedback of star formation and nuclearactivity in ngc1068, a nearby (d=14mpc) seyfert 2 barred galaxy, by analyzingthe distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the disk. we have usedalma to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (co(3-2),co(6-5), hcn(4-3), hco+(4-3) and cs(7-6)) and their underlying continuumemission in the central r ~ 2kpc of ngc1068 with spatial resolutions ~0.3"-0.5" (~ 20-35pc). molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detectedfrom a r ~ 200pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (cnd), from the2.6kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3kpc starburst (sb) ring. mostof the emission in hco+, hcn and cs stems from the cnd. molecular line ratiosshow dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the cnd that are correlatedwith the uv/x-ray illumination by the agn, betraying ongoing feedback. the gaskinematics from r ~ 50pc out to r ~ 400pc reveal a massive (m_mol ~ 2.7 (+0.9,-1.2) x 10^7 msun) outflow in all molecular tracers. the tight correlationbetween the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet and the occurrence of outwardmotions in the disk suggests that the outflow is agn-driven. the outflow rateestimated in the cnd, dm/dt ~ 63 (+21, -37) msun yr^-1, is an order ofmagnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming thatthe outflow is agn-driven. the power of the agn is able to account for theestimated momentum and kinetic luminosity of the outflow. the cnd mass loadrate of the cnd outflow implies a very short gas depletion time scale of &lt;=1myr.

1406.1465	the formation of massive primordial stars in the presence of moderate uv  backgrounds	radiative feedback from populations ii stars played a vital role in earlystructure formation. particularly, photons below the lyman limit can escape thestar forming regions and produce a background ultraviolet (uv) flux whichconsequently may influence the pristine halos far away from the radiationsources. these photons can quench the formation of molecular hydrogen byphoto-detachment of $\rm h^{-}$. in this study, we explore the impact of suchuv radiation on fragmentation in massive primordial halos of a few times $\rm10^{7}$~m${_\odot}$. to accomplish this goal, we perform high resolutioncosmological simulations for two distinct halos and vary the strength of theimpinging background uv field in units of $\rm j_{21}$. we further make use ofsink particles to follow the evolution for 10,000 years after reaching themaximum refinement level. no vigorous fragmentation is observed in uvilluminated halos while the accretion rate changes according to the thermalproperties. our findings show that a few 100-10, 000 solar mass protostars areformed when halos are irradiated by $\rm j_{21}=10-500$ at $\rm z&gt;10$ andsuggest a strong relation between the strength of uv flux and mass of aprotostar. this mode of star formation is quite different from minihalos, ashigher accretion rates of about $\rm 0.01-0.1$ m$_{\odot}$/yr are observed bythe end of our simulations. the resulting massive stars are the potentialcradles for the formation of intermediate mass black holes at earlier cosmictimes and contribute to the formation of a global x-ray background.

1408.1253	effects of turbulence and rotation on protostar formation as a precursor  to seed black holes	context. the seeds of the first supermassive black holes may have resultedfrom the direct collapse of hot primordial gas in $\gtrsim 10^4$ k haloes,forming a supermassive or quasistar as an intermediate stage.  aims. we explore the formation of a protostar resulting from the collapse ofprimordial gas in the presence of a strong lyman-werner radiation background.particularly, we investigate the impact of turbulence and rotation on thefragmentation behaviour of the gas cloud. we accomplish this goal by varyingthe initial turbulent and rotational velocities.  methods. we performed 3d adaptive mesh refinement simulations with aresolution of 64 cells per jeans length using the enzo code, simulating theformation of a protostar up to unprecedentedly high central densities of$10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, and spatial scales of a few solar radii. to achieve thisgoal, we employed the krome package to improve modelling of the chemical andthermal processes.  results. we find that the physical properties of the simulated gas cloudsbecome similar on small scales, irrespective of the initial amount ofturbulence and rotation. after the highest level of refinement was reached, thesimulations have been evolved for an additional ~5 freefall times. a singlebound clump with a radius of $2 \times 10^{-2}$ au and a mass of ~$7 \times10^{-2}$ m$_{\odot}$ is formed at the end of each simulation, marking the onsetof protostar formation. no strong fragmentation is observed by the end of thesimulations, regardless of the initial amount of turbulence or rotation, andhigh accretion rates of a few solar masses per year are found.  conclusions. given such high accretion rates, a quasistar of $10^5$m$_{\odot}$ is expected to form within $10^5$ years.

1408.3061	how realistic uv spectra and x-rays suppress the abundance of direct  collapse black holes	observations of high redshift quasars at $z&gt;6$ indicate that they harborsupermassive black holes (smbhs) of a billion solar masses. the direct collapsescenario has emerged as the most plausible way to assemble smbhs. the nurseriesfor the direct collapse black holes are massive primordial halos illuminatedwith an intense uv flux emitted by population ii (pop ii) stars. in this study,we compute the critical value of such a flux ($j_{21}^{\rm crit}$) forrealistic spectra of pop ii stars through three-dimensional cosmologicalsimulations. we derive the dependence of $j_{21}^{\rm crit}$ on the radiationspectra, on variations from halo to halo, and on the impact of x-rayionization. our findings show that the value of $j_{21}^{\rm crit}$ is a fewtimes $\rm 10^4$ and only weakly depends on the adopted radiation spectra inthe range between $t_{\rm rad}=2 \times 10^4-10^5$ k. for three simulated halosof a few times $\rm 10^{7}$~m$_{\odot}$, $j_{21}^{\rm crit}$ varies from $\rm 2\times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^4$. the impact of x-ray ionization is almostnegligible and within the expected scatter of $j_{21}^{\rm crit}$ forbackground fluxes of $j_{\rm x,21} \leq 0.1$. the computed estimates of$j_{21}^{\rm crit}$ have profound implications for the quasar abundance at$z=10$ as it lowers the number density of black holes forming through anisothermal direct collapse by a few orders of magnitude below the observedblack holes density. however, the sites with moderate amounts of $\rm h_2$cooling may still form massive objects sufficient to be compatible withobservations.

0804.4449	monte carlo simulation of particle interactions at high dynamic range:  advancing beyond the googol	we present a method which extends monte carlo studies to situations thatrequire a large dynamic range in particle number. the underlying idea is that,in order to calculate the collisional evolution of a system, some particleinteractions are more important than others and require more resolution, whilethe behavior of the less important, usually of smaller mass, particles can beconsidered collectively. in this approximation groups of identical particles,sharing the same mass and structural parameters, operate as one unit. theamount of grouping is determined by the zoom factor -- a free parameter thatdetermines on which particles the computational effort is focused. two methodsfor choosing the zoom factors are discussed: the `equal mass method,' in whichthe groups trace the mass density of the distribution, and the `distributionmethod,' which additionally follows fluctuations in the distribution. bothmethods achieve excellent correspondence with analytic solutions to thesmoluchowski coagulation equation. the grouping method is furthermore appliedto simulations involving runaway kernels, where the particle interaction rateis a strong function of particle mass, and to situations that includecatastrophic fragmentation. for the runaway simulations previous predictionsfor the decrease of the runaway timescale with the initial number of particles${\cal n}$ are reconfirmed, extending ${\cal n}$ to $10^{160}$. astrophysicalapplications include modeling of dust coagulation, planetesimal accretion, andthe dynamical evolution of stars in large globular clusters. the proposedmethod is a powerful tool to compute the evolution of any system where theparticles interact through discrete events, with the particle propertiescharacterized by structural parameters.

1511.03431	consistent dust and gas models for protoplanetary disks. i. disk shape,  dust settling, opacities, and pahs	we propose a set of standard assumptions for the modelling of class ii andiii protoplanetary disks, which includes detailed continuum radiative transfer,thermo-chemical modelling of gas and ice, and line radiative transfer fromoptical to cm wavelengths. we propose new standard dust opacities for diskmodels, we present a simplified treatment of pahs sufficient to reproduce thepah emission features, and we suggest using a simple treatment of dustsettling. we roughly adjust parameters to obtain a model that predicts typicalclass ii t tauri star continuum and line observations. we systematically studythe impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dustsettling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum andline observables, in particular on the sed, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,and emission lines including [oi] 63um, high-j co lines, (sub-)mm coisotopologue lines, and co fundamental ro-vibrational lines. we find thatevolved dust properties (large grains) often needed to fit the sed, haveimportant consequences for disk chemistry and heating/cooling balance, leadingto stronger emission lines in general. strong dust settling and missing diskflaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects onfar-ir gas emission lines. pah molecules can shield the gas from stellar uvradiation because of their strong absorption and negligible scatteringopacities. the observable millimetre-slope of the sed can become significantlymore gentle in the case of cold disk midplanes, which we find regularly in ourt tauri models. we propose to use line observations of robust chemical tracersof the gas, such as o, co, and h2, as additional constraints to determine somekey properties of the disks, such as disk shape and mass, opacities, and thedust/gas ratio, by simultaneously fitting continuum and line observations.

1511.06696	how chemistry influences cloud structure, star formation, and the imf	in the earliest phases of star-forming clouds, stable molecular species, suchas co, are important coolants in the gas phase. depletion of these molecules ondust surfaces affects the thermal balance of molecular clouds and with thattheir whole evolution. for the first time, we study the effect of grain surfacechemistry (gsc) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function(imf). we follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat thegas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. weperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a puregas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. the modelsdisplay different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. the equation ofstate (eos) of the gas becomes softer with co freeze-out and the results showthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution historysuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.while the stellar mass distribution results in a different imf when we considerpure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the gsc, the divergence from apure gas-phase model is minimal. we find that the impact of freeze-out isbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. we alsofind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate thatthis may be a result from the changes in the eos caused by the gas-dust thermalcoupling. we conclude that gsc plays a big role in the chemical composition ofmolecular clouds and that surface processes are needed to accurately interpretobservations, however, that gsc does not have a significant impact as far asstar formation and the imf is concerned.

0705.3902	a derivation of einstein gravity without the axiom of choice: topology  hidden in gr	a derivation of the equations of motion of general relativity is presentedthat does not invoke the axiom of choice, but requires the explicitconstruction of a choice function q for continuous three-space regions. themotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the backgroundindependence intrinsic to einstein gravity one step further, and to assure thatboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion arederived are as self-consistent as possible. that is, solutions to the equationsof motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical anddistinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. however, in order toderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose athree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physicallyappropriate geometry. the expression of this choice process requires athree-dimensional topological manifold q, to which all considered three-spaceregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.these solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through thetopology of q and constitute einstein gravity. q is given by 2t^3+3s^1xs^2, andis embedded in four dimensions. this points toward a hidden topological contentfor general relativity, best phrased as: q and q provide a structure for how tochoose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has,while at the same time q and q determine that only gr can endow a three-spacewith those geometric properties. in this sense, avoiding the axiom of choiceallows one to gain physical insight into gr. possible links with holography arepointed out.

astro-ph;0404340	molecular hydrogen formation on dust grains in the high redshift  universe	we study the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grain surfaces and applyour results to the high redshift universe. we find that a range of physicalparameters, in particular dust temperature and gas temperature, but not so muchdust surface composition, influence the formation rate of h$_2$. the h$_2$formation rate is found to be suppressed above gas kinetic temperatures of afew hundred k and for dust temperatures above 200-300 k and below 10 k. wehighlight the differences between our treatment of the h$_2$ formation processand other descriptions in the literature. we also study the relative importanceof h$_2$ formation on dust grains with respect to molecular hydrogen formationin the gas phase, through the h$^-$ route. the ratio of formation rates ofthese two routes depends to a large part on the dust abundance, on the electronabundance, and also on the relative strength of the fuv (extra-)galacticradiation field. we find that for a cosmological evolution of the starformation rate and dust density consistent with the madau plot, a positivefeedback effect on the abundance of h$_2$ due to the presence of dust grainscan occur at redshifts $z\ge 3$. this effect occurs for a dust-to-gas massratio as small as 10$^{-3}$ of the galactic value.

astro-ph;0501069	the impact of gravitational redshift on systemic water maser emission in  ngc 4258	ngc 4258 is well known for its 22 ghz water maser features that appear toreside in a thin keplerian disk orbiting at r_0=0.13 pc. the influence ofgravitational redshift on the level of maser saturation and the line strengthand width of systemic water maser emission is studied. the effectivegravitational velocity shift along the gain path through the disk amounts toabout twice the thermal velocity width of h2o molecules at 500 k for a masingring of thickness 0.2r_0. this gr induced frequency shift has a sign oppositeto the shift caused by the projected velocity difference vector of keplerianmotion on the blue side of the systemic maser emission and has the same sign onthe red systemic side. consequently, the negative optical depth that a linephoton sees as it traverses the masing disk along a path of minimal keplerianvelocity gradient is larger on the blue side. note that one is not concernedhere with an overall shift in the maser spectrum caused by the fact that themasing ring as a whole is located in the black hole's potential well, i.e., itis the change in the gravitational potential along the gain path that matters.it is found, for a schwarzschild metric, that saturation is enhanced(suppressed) for systemic blue-shifted (red-shifted) maser features bygravitational redshift of line photons. approaching peak flux systemic featuresare, on average, brighter, due to saturation, and wider (~2 km/s), due torebroadening, than their receding counterparts (~1 km/s). the effects areconsistent with observations that span several years, i.e., over periods longerthan needed for disk material to move through the systemic emission region.further confirmation of this effect can follow by combining all availablesystemic 22 ghz data over the past two decades (abridged).

astro-ph;0506349	gravoturbulent star formation: effects of the equation of state on  stellar masses	stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. thesupersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in galactic molecular gas generatesstrong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and mostmassive regions. collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.  turbulence plays a dual role. on global scales it provides support, while atthe same time it can promote local collapse. stellar birth is thus intimatelylinked to the dynamic behavior of parental gas clouds, which governs when andwhere protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass viaaccretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. the equationof state plays a pivotal role in the fragmentation process. under typical cloudconditions, massive stars form as part of dense clusters following the "normal"mass function observed, e.g. in the solar neighborhood. however, for gas withan effective polytropic index greater than unity star formation becomes biasedtowards isolated massive stars. this is relevant for understanding theproperties of zero-metallicity stars (population iii) or stars that form underextreme environmental conditions like in the galactic center or in luminousstarbursts.

astro-ph;0603672	line profiles of water for the photon dominated region and embedded  sources in the s140 region	a radiative transfer method for the treatment of molecular lines ispresented. we apply this method to previous swas and iso observations of watervapor in the source s140 in order to make models to plan for, and to interpret,hifi data. level populations are calculated with the use of a three-dimensional(multi-zone) escape probability method and with a long characteristic code thatuses monte carlo techniques with fixed directions. homogeneous andinhomogeneous models are used to compute the differences between water lineprofiles across the s140 region. we find that when an outflow or infallvelocity field with a gradient of a few kms^{-1} is adopted, line profiles witha fwhm of 6 kms^{-1} are found, in agreement with observations. inhomogeneousmodels are favoured to produce a single-peaked line profile. when zooming in onsmaller regions within the pdr, the shapes of the line profiles start to differdue to the different temperature and density distributions there. the embeddedsources are traced by high excitation lines of, e.g., 3_{21}-2_{21},3_{03}-2_{12}, 2_{12}-1_{01} and 2_{20}-1_{11}. the computed intensities areroughly consistent with existing iso observations. water emission in a pdrsource like s140 requires a combination of a pure pdr and an embedded source inorder to match the observations. because of its good angular resolution, hifiwill be able to distinguish between a dense star forming region or a morediffuse gas component. it is therefore important for future observing programsto consider both in their predictions of the emission characteristics of waterin these environments.

astro-ph;0607615	diagnostics of active galaxies: i. modeling the infrared properties of  dusty cores of starburst galaxies	an evolutionary model of star formation in ulirgs was created using existingstar formation and radiative transfer codes (starburst99, radmc and radical) asbuilding blocks. the results of the simulations are compared to data from twoiras catalogs. from the simulations it is found that the dust surrounding thestarburst region is made up from two components. there is a low optical depth(tau=0.1, which corresponds to 0.1% of the total dust mass), hot (t~400k)non-grey component close to the starburst (scale size 10pc) and a large scale,colder grey component (100pc, 75k) with a much larger column (tau=10). thesimulations also show that starburst galaxies can be powered by massive starformation. the parameters for this star forming region are difficult todetermine, since the ir continuum luminosity is only sensitive to the total uvinput. therefore, there is a degeneracy between the total starburst mass andthe initial mass function (imf) slope. a less massive star formation with ashallower imf will produce the same amount of ob stars and therefore the sameamount of irradiating uv flux. assuming the stars are formed according to asalpeter imf (psi(m) ~ m^-2.35), the star formation region should produce 10^9msun of stars (either in one instantaneous burst, or in a continuous process)in order to produce enough ir radiation.
