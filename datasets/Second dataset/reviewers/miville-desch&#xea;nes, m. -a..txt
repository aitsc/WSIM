1004.2595	planck pre-launch status: high frequency instrument polarization  calibration	the high frequency instrument of planck will map the entire sky in themillimeter and sub-millimeter domain from 100 to 857 ghz with unprecedentedsensitivity to polarization ($\delta p/t_{\tiny cmb} \sim 4\cdot 10^{-6}$) at100, 143, 217 and 353 ghz. it will lead to major improvements in ourunderstanding of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and polarizedforeground signals. planck will make high resolution measurements of the$e$-mode spectrum (up to $\ell \sim 1500$) and will also play a prominent rolein the search for the faint imprint of primordial gravitational waves on thecmb polarization. this paper addresses the effects of calibration of bothtemperature (gain) and polarization (polarization efficiency and detectororientation) on polarization measurements. the specific requirements on thepolarization parameters of the instrument are set and we report on theirpre-flight measurement on hfi bolometers. we present a semi-analytical methodthat exactly accounts for the scanning strategy of the instrument as well asthe combination of different detectors. we use this method to propagate errorsthrough to the cmb angular power spectra in the particular case of planck-hfi,and to derive constraints on polarization parameters. we show that in order tolimit the systematic error to 10% of the cosmic variance of the $e$-mode powerspectrum, uncertainties in gain, polarization efficiency and detectororientation must be below 0.15%, 0.3% and 1\deg\ respectively. pre-launchground measurements reported in this paper already fulfill these requirements.

1005.2746	herschel-spire observations of the polaris flare : structure of the  diffuse interstellar medium at the sub-parsec scale	we present a power spectrum analysis of the herschel-spire observations ofthe polaris flare, a high galactic latitude cirrus cloud midway between thediffuse and molecular phases. the spire images of the polaris flare reveal forthe first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01parsec over a 10 square degrees region. these exceptional observationshighlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellarmedium even in diffuse regions of the map. the power spectrum analysis showsthat the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a singlepower law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30" to 8 degrees.that the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to thespire angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulenceextends down to the 0.01 pc scale. the power spectrum analysis also allows theidentification of a poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreementwith predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at spire wavelengths.finally, the comparison of the spire and iras 100 micron data of the polarisflare clearly assesses the capability of spire in maping diffuse emission overlarge areas.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1204.1318	planck intermediate results ii: comparison of sunyaev-zeldovich  measurements from planck and from the arcminute microkelvin imager for 11  galaxy clusters	a comparison is presented of sunyaev-zeldovich measurements for 11 galaxyclusters as obtained by planck and by the ground-based interferometer, thearcminute microkelvin imager. assuming a universal spherically-symmetricgeneralised navarro, frenk &amp; white (gnfw) model for the cluster gas pressureprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated compton-y parameter (y_500) andthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. our resulting constraints in they_500-theta_500 2d parameter space derived from the two instruments overlapsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendencyfor ami to find the sunyaev-zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size andfainter than planck. significant discrepancies exist for the three remainingclusters in the sample, namely a1413, a1914, and the newly-discovered planckcluster plckesz g139.59+24.18. the robustness of the analysis of both theplanck and ami data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and fromdiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for thediscrepancies found. for a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigatedthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating theanalysis adopting the best-fitting gnfw profile shape which best matches x-rayobservations. adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the x-ray data doesnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of fiveclusters. though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adoptedgnfw model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

1204.2743	planck intermediate results. iii. the relation between galaxy cluster  mass and sunyaev-zeldovich signal	we examine the relation between the galaxy cluster mass m andsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect signal d_a^2 y for a sample of 19 objects forwhich weak lensing (wl) mass measurements obtained from subaru telescope dataare available in the literature. hydrostatic x-ray masses are derived fromxmm-newton archive data and the sz effect signal is measured from planckall-sky survey data. we find an m_wl-d_a^2 y relation that is consistent inslope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measuresbased on hydrostatic x-ray mass-proxy relations. we verify that our sz effectmeasurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations fromplanck data. for the present sample, the hydrostatic x-ray masses at r_500 areon average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, atodds with expectations. we show that the mass discrepancy is driven by adifference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for thepresent sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration isespecially large for disturbed systems. the mass discrepancy is also linked tothe offset in centres used by the x-ray and weak lensing analyses, which againis most important in disturbed systems. we outline several approaches that areneeded to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with x-ray andweak lensing observations.

1207.3675	the pre-launch planck sky model: a model of sky emission at  submillimetre to centimetre wavelengths	we present the planck sky model (psm), a parametric model for the generationof all-sky, few arcminute resolution maps of sky emission at submillimetre tocentimetre wavelengths, in both intensity and polarisation. several options areimplemented to model the cosmic microwave background, galactic diffuse emission(synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning dust, co lines), galactic h-iiregions, extragalactic radio sources, dusty galaxies, and thermal and kineticsunyaev-zeldovich signals from clusters of galaxies. each component issimulated by means of educated interpolations/extrapolations of data setsavailable at the time of the launch of the planck mission, complemented bystate-of-the-art models of the emission. distinctive features of thesimulations are: spatially varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust;different spectral parameters for each point source; modeling of the clusteringproperties of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuationsin the cosmic infrared background. the psm enables the production of randomrealizations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational datawithin their uncertainties, and is implemented in a software package that isregularly updated with incoming information from observations. the model isexpected to serve as a useful tool for optimizing planned microwave andsub-millimetre surveys and to test data processing and analysis pipelines. itis, in particular, used for the development and validation of data analysispipelines within the planck collaboration. a version of the software that canbe used for simulating the observations for a variety of experiments is madeavailable on a dedicated website.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1301.3446	the structure of the thermally bistable and turbulent atomic gas in the  local interstellar medium	this paper is a numerical study of the condensation of the warm neutralmedium (wnm) into cold neutral medium (cnm) structures under the effect ofturbulence and thermal instability. using low resolution simulations weexplored the impact of the wnm initial density and properties of the turbulence(stirring in fourier with a varying mix of solenoidal and compressive modes) onthe cold gas formation. two sets of initial conditions which match theobservations were selected to produce high resolution simulations (1024^3)allowing to study in details the properties of the produced dense structures.for typical values of the density, pressure and velocity dispersion of the wnmin the solar neighborhood, the turbulent motions of the hi can not provoque thephase transition from wnm to cnm, whatever their amplitude and theirdistribution in solenoidal and compressive modes. on the other hand we showthat a quasi-isothermal increase in wnm density of a factor of 2 to 4 is enoughto induce the phase transition, leading to the transition of about 40 percentof the gas to the cold phase within 1 myr. given the observed properties of thehi in the local ism, the wnm and individual cnm structures in the local ism aresub or transsonic and their dynamics are tightly interwoven. the velocity fieldbears the evidence of subsonic turbulence with a 2d power spectrum followingthe kolmogorov law as p(k) \sim k^{-8/3} while the density is highly contrastedwith a singificantly shallower power spectrum, reminiscent of what is observedin the cold ism. supra-thermal line width observed for cnm might be the resultof relative velocity between cold structures. finally, the cold structuresdenser than 5 cm^{-3} reproduce well the laws m \sim l^{2.25-2.28} and sigma(v)\sim 0.5-0.8l^{1/3} generally observed in molecular clouds.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1303.5089	planck 2013 results. xxix. planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we describe the all-sky planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidatesderived from sunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect detections using the first 15.5months of planck satellite observations. the catalogue contains 1227 entries,making it over six times the size of the planck early sz (esz) sample and thelargest sz-selected catalogue to date. it contains 861 confirmed clusters, ofwhich 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-upobservations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. the remaining366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into threeclasses according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be trueclusters. the planck sz catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}msun. confirmation of cluster candidates through comparisonwith existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is thestatistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness andstatistical reliability. the outputs of the validation process are provided asadditional information. this gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 clusterredshifts, and for all these planck clusters we also include a mass estimatedfrom a newly-proposed sz-mass proxy. a refined measure of the sz comptonparameter for the clusters with x-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an x-rayflux for all the planck clusters not previously detected in x-ray surveys.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1406.7482	planck intermediate results. xxiv. constraints on variation of  fundamental constants	any variation of the fundamental physical constants, and more particularly ofthe fine structure constant, $\alpha$, or of the mass of the electron, $m_e$,would affect the recombination history of the universe and cause an imprint onthe cosmic microwave background angular power spectra. we show that the planckdata allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the finestructure constant at redshift $z\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared towmap data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the hubble constant, $h_0$.in addition to $\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the massof the electron, $m_{\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the twoconstants. we examine in detail the degeneracies between fundamental constantsand the cosmological parameters, in order to compare the limits obtained fromplanck and wmap and to determine the constraining power gained by includingother cosmological probes. we conclude that independent time variations of thefine structure constant and of the mass of the electron are constrained byplanck to ${\delta\alpha}/{\alpha}= (3.6\pm 3.7)\times10^{-3}$ and ${\deltam_{\rm e}}/{m_{\rm e}}= (4 \pm 11)\times10^{-3}$ at the 68% confidence level.we also investigate the possibility of a spatial variation of the finestructure constant. the relative amplitude of a dipolar spatial variation of$\alpha$ (corresponding to a gradient across our hubble volume) is constrainedto be $\delta\alpha/\alpha=(-2.4\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-2}$.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.01597	planck 2015 results. xxiv. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  counts	we present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from theplanck full mission data set. our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detectedvia their sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, andis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 planck cluster cosmologysample. the counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatibleconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. taking advantage of thelarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution inredshift and signal-to-noise. we use mass estimates from two recent studies ofgravitational lensing of background galaxies by planck clusters to providepriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. in addition, we use lensing ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations by planck clustersas a third independent constraint on this parameter. these various calibrationsimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations invarying degrees of tension with those coming from planck analysis of primaryfluctuations in the cmb; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tensionis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largestestimated value it remains substantial. we also examine constraints onextensions to the base flat $\lambda cdm$ model by combining the cluster andcmb constraints. the combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because itsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the hubble parameter, therebyexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-levelto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide astringent test of the base $\lambda cdm$ model.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.07435	dust variations in the diffuse interstellar medium: constraints on milky  way dust from planck-hfi observations	the planck-hfi all-sky survey from 353 to 857ghz combined with the 100microns iras show that the dust properties vary in the diffuse ism at highgalactic latitude (1e19&lt;nh&lt;2.5e20 h/cm2). our aim is to explain thesevariations with changes in the ism properties and grain evolution. our startingpoint is the latest core-mantle dust model. it consists of small aromatic-richcarbon grains, larger amorphous carbon grains with aliphatic-rich cores andaromatic-rich mantles, and amorphous silicates with fe/fes nano-inclusionscovered by aromatic-rich carbon mantles. we explore whether variations in theradiation field or in the gas density distribution in the diffuse ism couldexplain the observations. the dust properties are also varied in terms ofmantle thickness, fe/fes inclusions, carbon abundance, and size distribution.variations in the radiation field intensity and gas density distribution cannotexplain the observed variations but radiation fields harder than the standardisrf may participate in creating part of them. we further show that variationsin the grain mantle thickness coupled with changes in the grain sizedistribution can reproduce most of the observations. we put a limit on themantle thickness of the silicates (~10-15nm), and find that aromatic-richmantles are needed for the carbon grains (at least 5-7.5nm thick). we also findthat changes in the carbon abundance in the grains could explain part of theobserved variations. finally, we show that varying the composition of fe/fesinclusions in the silicates cannot account for the variations. with smallvariations in the dust properties, we are able to explain most of thevariations in the dust emission observed by planck-hfi in the diffuse ism. wealso find that the small realistic changes in the dust properties that weconsider almost perfectly match the anti-correlation and scatter in theobserved beta-t relation.

0805.0269	component separation methods for the planck mission	the planck satellite will map the full sky at nine frequencies from 30 to 857ghz. the cmb intensity and polarization that are its prime targets arecontaminated by foreground emission. the goal of this paper is to compareproposed methods for separating cmb from foregrounds based on their differentspectral and spatial characteristics, and to separate the foregrounds intocomponents of different physical origin. a component separation challenge hasbeen organized, based on a set of realistically complex simulations of skyemission. several methods including those based on internal templatesubtraction, maximum entropy method, parametric method, spatial and harmoniccross correlation methods, and independent component analysis have been tested.different methods proved to be effective in cleaning the cmb maps fromforeground contamination, in reconstructing maps of diffuse galactic emissions,and in detecting point sources and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich signals. the powerspectrum of the residuals is, on the largest scales, four orders of magnitudelower than that of the input galaxy power spectrum at the foreground minimum.the cmb power spectrum was accurately recovered up to the sixth acoustic peak.the point source detection limit reaches 100 mjy, and about 2300 clusters aredetected via the thermal sz effect on two thirds of the sky. we have found thatno single method performs best for all scientific objectives. we foresee thatthe final component separation pipeline for planck will involve a combinationof methods and iterations between processing steps targeted at differentobjectives such as diffuse component separation, spectral estimation andcompact source extraction.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0406237	structure and colors of diffuse emission in the spitzer galactic first  look survey	we investigate the density structure of the interstellar medium using newhigh-resolution maps of the 8 micron, 24 micron, and 70 micron surfacebrightness towards a molecular cloud in the gum nebula, made as part of thespitzer space telescope galactic first look survey. the maps are correlatedwith 100 micron images measured with iras. at 24 and 70 micron, the spatialpower spectrum of surface brightness follows a power law with spectral index-3.5. at 24 micron, the power law behavior is remarkably consistent from the0.2 degree size of our maps down to the 5 arcsecond spatial resolution. thus,the structure of the 24 micron emission is self-similar even at milliparsecscales. the combined power spectrum produced from spitzer 24 micron and iras 25micron images is consistent with a change in the power law exponent from -2.6to -3.5. the decrease may be due to the transition from a two-dimensional tothree-dimensional structure. under this hypothesis, we estimate the thicknessof the emitting medium to be 0.3 pc.
