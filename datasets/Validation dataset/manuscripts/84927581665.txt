A note on Sylvester-type equations This work is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the relationship between the theory of the generalized (palindromic) eigenvalue problem and the theory of the Sylvester-type equations. Under a regularity assumption for a specific matrix pencil, we show that the solution of the ∗-Sylvester matrix equation is uniquely determined and can be obtained by considering its corresponding deflating subspace. We also propose an iterative method with quadratic convergence to compute the stabilizing solution of the ∗-Sylvester matrix equation via the well-developed palindromic doubling algorithm. We believe that our discussion is the first which implements the tactic of the deflating subspace for solving Sylvester equations and could give rise to the possibility of developing an advanced and effective solver for different types of matrix equations.
