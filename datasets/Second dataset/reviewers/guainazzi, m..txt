0903.2444	the x-ray view of giga-hertz peaked spectrum radio galaxies	this paper presents the x-ray properties of a flux- and volume-limitedcomplete sample of 16 giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) galaxies. this studyaddresses three basic questions in our understanding of the nature andevolution of gps sources: a) what is the physical origin of the x-ray emissionin gps galaxies? b) what physical system is associated with the x-rayobscuration? c) what is the "endpoint" of the evolution of compact radiosources? we obtain a 100% (94%) detection fraction in the 0.5-2 kev (0.5-10kev) energy band. gps galaxy x-ray spectra are typically highly obscured. thex-ray column density is higher than the hi column density measured in the radioby a factor of 10 to 100. gps galaxies lie well on the extrapolation to highradio powers of the correlation between radio and x-ray luminosity known inlow-luminosity fri radio galaxies. on the other hand, gps galaxies exhibit acomparable x-ray luminosity to frii radio galaxies, notwithstanding their muchhigher radio luminosity. the x-ray to radio luminosity ratio distribution inour sample is consistent with the bulk of the high-energy emission beingproduced by the accretion disk, as well as with dynamical models of gpsevolution where x-rays are produced by compton upscattering of ambient photons.further support for the former scenario comes from the location of gps galaxiesin the x-ray to o[iii] luminosity ratio versus column density plane. we proposethat gps galaxies are young radio sources, which would reach their fullmaturity as classical frii radio galaxies. however, column densities ~10^{22}atoms/cm/cm could lead to a significant underestimate of dynamical agedeterminations based on the hotspot recession velocity measurements.

0905.2973	an x-ray view of 82 liners with chandra and xmm-newton data	we present the results of an homogeneous x-ray analysis for 82 nearby linersselected from the catalogue of carrillo et al. (1999). all sources haveavailable chandra (68 sources) and/or xmm-newton (55 sources) observations.this is the largest sample of liners with x-ray spectral data (60 out of the 82objects) and significantly improves our previous analysis based on chandra datafor 51 liners (gonzalez-martin et al. 2006). it increases both the sample sizeand adds xmm-newton data. new models permit the inclusion of double absorbersin the spectral fits. nuclear x-ray morphology is inferred from the compactnessof detected nuclear sources in the hard band (4.5-8.0 kev). sixty per cent ofthe sample shows a compact nuclear source and are classified as agn candidates.the spectral analysis indicates that best fits involve a composite model:absorbed primary continuum and (2) soft spectrum below 2 kev described by anabsorbed scatterer and/or a thermal component. the resulting median spectraparameters and their standard deviations are: g=2.11, &lt;kt&gt;=0.54 kev,&lt;log(nh1)&gt;=21.32 and &lt;log(nh2)&gt;=21.93. we complement our x-ray results with ouranalysis of hst optical images and literature data on emission lines, radiocompactness and stellar population. adding all these multiwavelength data, weconclude that evidence do exist supporting the agn nature of their nuclearengine for 80% of the sample (66 out of 82 objects).

0907.0405	first high-resolution detection of a warm absorber in the broad line  radio galaxy 3c 382	recent high-resolution measurements suggest that the soft x-ray spectrum ofobscured radio galaxies (rg) exhibits signatures of photoionised gas (e.g. 3c445 and 3c 33) similar to those observed in radio-quiet obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn). while signatures of warm absorbing gas covering a widerange of temperature and ionisation states have been detected in about one halfof the population of nearby seyfert 1 galaxies, no traces of warm absorber gashave been reported to date in the high-resolution spectra of broad line radiogalaxies (blrg). we present here the first detection of a soft x-ray warmabsorber in the powerful frii blrg 3c 382 using the reflection gratingspectrometer (rgs) on-board xmm-newton. the absorption gas appears to be highlyionised, with column density of the order of 10^{22} cm^{-2}, ionisationparameter log\xi&gt;2 erg cm s^{-1} and outflow velocities of the order of 10^{3}km s^{-1}. the absorption lines may come from regions located outside thetorus, however at distances less than 60 pc. this result may indicate that aplasma ejected at velocities near the speed of light and a photoionised gaswith slower, outflow velocities can coexist in the same source beyond the broadline regions.

0907.4897	the x-ray eclipse of the dwarf nova ht cas observed by the xmm-newton  satellite: spectral and timing analysis	a cataclysmic variable is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf thataccretes material from a secondary object via the roche-lobe mechanism. in thecase of long enough observation, a detailed temporal analysis can be performed,allowing the physical properties of the binary system to be determined. wepresent an xmm-newton observation of the dwarf nova ht cas acquired to resolvethe binary system eclipses and constrain the origin of the x-rays observed. wealso compare our results with previous rosat and asca data. after the spectralanalysis of the three epic camera signals, the observed x-ray light curve wasstudied with well known techniques and the eclipse contact points obtained.  the x-ray spectrum can be described by thermal bremsstrahlung of temperature$kt_1=6.89 \pm 0.23$ kev plus a black-body component (upper limit) withtemperature $kt_2=30_{-6}^{+8}$ ev. neglecting the black-body, the bolometricabsorption corrected flux is $f^{\rm{bol}}=(6.5\pm 0.1)\times10^{-12}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which, for a distance of ht cas of 131 pc, corresponds to abolometric luminosity of $(1.33\pm 0.02)\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  the study of the eclipse in the epic light curve permits us to constrain thesize and location of the x-ray emitting region, which turns out to be close tothe white dwarf radius. we measure an x-ray eclipse somewhat smaller (but onlyat a level of $\simeq 1.5 \sigma$) than the corresponding optical one. if thisis the case, we have possibly identified the signature of either high latitudeemission or a layer of x-ray emitting material partially obscured by anaccretion disk.

0908.0268	agn/starburst connection in action: the half million second rgs spectrum  of ngc1365	we present a deep (~5.8 days) 0.3-2 kev high-resolution spectrum of ngc1365,collected with the reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) on board xmm-newton.the spectrum is dominated by strong recombination lines of he- and h-liketransitions from carbon to silicon, as well as by l transitions from fexvii.the continuum is strong, especially in the 10 to 20 angstrom, range. formalfits require two optically thin, collisionally ionised plasma components, withtemperatures ~300 and ~640 ev. however, they leave the bulk of the forbiddencomponents of the he-alpha ovii and nvi triplets unaccounted for. thesefeatures can be explained as being produced by photoionised gas. ngc1365 istherefore the first obscured agn, whose high-resolution x-ray spectrum requiresboth collisional ionisation and photoionisation. the relative weakness ofphotoionisation does not stem from the intrinsic weakness of its agn, whosex-ray luminosity is ~10^{42} erg/s. we suggest that it may instead come fromthe line-of-sight from the active nucleus to the nlr being blocked by opticallythick matter in the broad line region, at the same time responsible for thelarge observed variation of the column density obscuring the x-ray activenucleus. alternatively, ngc1365 could host a remarkably luminous nuclearstarburst when compared to the agn accretion power [abriged].

0909.4082	fitting liner nuclei within the agn family: a matter of obscuration?	in this paper we study the nuclear obscuration of galaxies hosting linersbased on their x-ray and optical emission. they show column densities (n_h) atsoft energies (0.5-2 kev) mostly related to the diffuse emission around theagn, showing a correlation with the optical extinction. n_h at hard energies(2-10 kev) seem to be much higher than what would be expected from the opticalextinction. they might be associated to the inner regions of the agn, buried atoptical wavelengths. the main result of this paper is that around 50% of ourliner sample shows signatures of compton-thickness (ct) according to the mostcommon tracers: the x-ray spectral index, f(2-10 kev)/f([oiii]) ratio andew(feka). however, the ews of ct liners are significantly lower than in ct sy,suggesting that the 2-10 kev emission is dominated by electron scattering ofthe otherwise invisible agn, or by emission from shocked gas associated to starformation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. however,no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes andx-ray classified ct objects. this may suggest that ct sources should be relatedto absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the agn, maybe inthe putative dusty torus. larger m_bh and lower eddington ratios than sygalaxies have been found. this effect can be better attributed to liner nucleibeing hosted by earlier morphological types than sy nuclei. however, it has tobe noted that, once a proper correction to the x-ray luminosity is applied,liners show eddington ratios overlapping those of sy 2. we speculate with apossible scenario for liner nuclei: an inner obscuring matter similar to thatof sy 2, and an external obscuring matter responsible for the opticalextinction. ct sources appear to be more common among liners than sy.

0707.2418	xmm-newton unveils the type 2 nature of the blrg 3c 445	we present an observation of xmm-newton that unambiguously reveals the``seyfert 2'' nature of the broad line radio galaxy 3c 445. for the first timethe soft excess of this source has been resolved. it consists of unobscuredscattered continuum flux and emission lines, likely produced in a warmphotoionized gas near the pole of an obscuring torus. the presence ofcircumnuclear (likely stratified) matter is supported by the complexobscuration of the nuclear region. seventy percent of the nuclear radiation(first component) is indeed obscured by a column density ~4*10^{23} cm^{-2},and 30 % (second component) is filtered by ~7* 10^{22} cm^{-2}. the firstcomponent is nuclear radiation directly observed by transmission through thethicker regions. the second one is of more uncertain nature. if the observerhas a deep view into the nucleus but near the edge of the torus, it could belight scattered by the inner wall of the torus and/or by photoionized gaswithin the broad line region observed through the thinner rim of thecircumnuclear matter.

1003.1285	a characterization of the ngc 4051 soft x-ray spectrum as observed by  xmm-newton	soft x-rays high resolution spectroscopy of obscured agns shows the existenceof a complex soft $x$-ray spectrum dominated by emission lines of he and h-liketransitions of elements from carbon to neon, as well as l-shell transitions dueto iron ions. in this paper we characterize the xmm-newton rgs spectrum of theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 observed during a low flux state and infer thephysical properties of the emitting and absorbing gas in the soft x-ray regime.x-ray high-resolution spectroscopy offers a powerful diagnostic tool since theobserved spectral features strongly depend on the physical properties of matter(ionization parameter u, electron density n_e, hydrogen column density n_h),which in turn are tightly related to the location and size of the x-rayemitting clouds. we carried out a phenomenological study to identify the atomictransitions detected in the spectra. this study suggests that the spectrum isdominated by emission from a photoionised plasma. then, we used thephotoionization code cloudy to produce synthetic models for the emission linecomponent and the warm absorber observed during phases of high intrinsicluminosity. the low state spectrum cannot be described by a singlephotoionization component. a multi-ionization phase gas with ionizationparameter in the range log u = 0.63-1.90 and column density log n_h =22.10-22.72 cm^-2 is required, while the electron density n_e remainsunconstrained. a warm absorber medium is required by the fit with parameterslog u = 0.85, log n_h = 23.40 and log n_e \ut&lt; 5. the model is consistent withan x-ray emitting regions at a distance &gt; 5 x 10^-2 pc from the central engine.

1003.1665	x-ray imaging of the ionisation cones in ngc 5252	the physical conditions of the gas forming the narrow line regions (nlr) inactive galactic nuclei (agn) have been extensively studied in the optical band.we take advantage of the spectacular extension ($\sim$15") of the nlr in thetype ii seyfert galaxy ngc 5252 and of the complementary characteristics of$xmm$--$newton$ and $chandra$ to investigate the physical conditions of the gasin this galaxy. the x-ray data from $xmm$--$newton$ are used to define thespectral properties of the ionising nuclear source. the $chandra$ data are usedto trace the spatial characteristics of the soft x-ray emission. thisinformation is then compared to the hst characteristics. the x-ray spectrum ofthe nucleus of ngc 5252 is intrinsically flat and absorbed by neutral gas witha column density n~10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. below 1 kev a soft excess is detected.the high-resolution spectrum obtained with the xmm-newton rgs shows thepresence, in the 0.2-1.5 kev range, of emission lines which strongly indicatethat the soft x-ray component is due to ionised gas. moreover, the soft x-rayemission is spatially resolved around and well overlaps the images obtained innarrow [oiii] optical band. the [oiii]/soft-x flux ratios along the ionisationcones is basically constant. this indicates that the electron density does notsignificantly deviates from the r$^{-2}$ law (constant ionisation parameter).this result combined with previous optical studies suggest two plausible butdifferent scenarios in the reconstruction of the last 30000 years history ofthe central agn. the most promising one is that the source is indeed a "quasarrelic" with steady and inefficient energy release from the accretion of matteronto the central super-massive black-hole. this scenario is suggested also bythe flat nuclear x-ray spectrum that suggests an advection dominate accretionflow (adaf) like emission mechanism.

1004.1442	the final verdict by xmm-newton: the x-ray obscured seyfert galaxy  ngc5506 has a broad fe k-alpha line	we present the first unambiguous evidence of a broad (gaussian width ~330 ev)component of the iron k-alpha fluorescent emission line in the x-ray obscurednarrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5506. this is the main results of aspectroscopic monitoring campaign on this source performed with the xmm-newtonobservatory between february 2001 and january 2009. the broad line lacksextreme redwards skewness. if modelled with a relativistic component, theprofile of the line is consistent with a flat emissivity radial dependence(alpha~1.9). the disk inclination (~40 degrees) is nominally larger thentypically observed in unobscured agn, in agreement with most measurements ofbroadened iron lines in seyfert 2 galaxies. the quality of the data allows usto decompose the full iron emission line complex, and to study its long-term(timescales of weeks to years) variability pattern. the intensity of theneutral and narrow iron k-alpha core remains constant during the monitoringcampaign. this indicates that the optically thick gas responsible for thenon-relativistic reprocessing of the primary agn continuum in ngc5506 isprobably located in the torus rather than in the optical broad line region.

1007.4762	fero: finding extreme relativistic objects. i. statistics of  relativistic fe kalpha lines in radio-quiet type 1 agn	accretion models predict that fluorescence lines broadened by relativisticeffects should arise from reflection of x-ray emission onto the inner region ofthe accretion disc surrounding the central black hole of active galactic nuclei(agn). the theory behind the origin of relativistic lines is well established,and observational evidence from a moderate number of sources seems to supportthe existence of these lines. the aim of this work is to establish the fractionof agn with relativistic fe kalpha lines, and study possible correlations withsource physical properties. an xmm-newton collection of 149 radio-quiet type 1agn has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search forsignificant evidence of a relativistically broadened fe kalpha line. to enablestatistical studies, an almost complete, flux-limited subsample of 31 sourceshas been defined. the 2-10 kev spectra of the fero sources have been comparedwith a complex model including most of the physical components observed in thex-ray spectra of seyfert galaxies: a power law primary continuum modified bynon-relativistic compton reflection and warm absorption, plus a series ofnarrow fe line reflection features. the observed fraction of sources in theflux-limited sample that show significant evidence of a relativistic fe kalphaline is 36%. the average line equivalent width (ew) is of the order of 100 ev,while the average disc inclination angle is 28+/-5 deg and the averagepower-law index of the radial disc emissivity law is 2.4+/-0.4. the spin valueis well constrained only in 2 cases (mcg-6-30-15 and mrk509), and in the restof the cases, whenever a constraint can be placed, it always implies therejection of the static black hole solution. the fe kalpha line ew does notcorrelate with disc parameters or with system physical properties, such asblack hole mass, accretion rate and hard x-ray luminosity.

0712.3445	heavy absorption and soft x-ray emission lines in the xmm-newton  spectrum of the type 2 radio-loud quasar 3c 234	we report results on a 40 ks xmm-newton observation of the type 2 quasar 3c234. optical spectropolarimetric data have demonstrated the presence of ahidden broad-line region in this powerful (m_v &lt;~ -24.2 after reddening andstarlight correction) narrow-line frii radio galaxy. our analysis is aimed atinvestigating the x-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which haveremained poorly known so far. we analyze the 0.5--10 kev spectroscopic datacollected by the epic cameras in 2006. the x-ray spectrum of this radio-loudquasar is typical of a local compton-thin seyfert 2 galaxy. it exhibits strongabsorption (nh~3.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}) and a narrow, neutral fe kalpha emissionline with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 ev. our observation also revealsthat the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lineswith a very low level of scattered primary continuum. a possible explanation ofthese features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperaturecollisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the highluminosity estimated for this component (l(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^{42} erg/s). it islikely that most of the soft x-ray emission originates from a photoionizedplasma as commonly observed in obscured, radio-quiet seyfert-like agns. thisx-ray observation has definitively confirmed the presence of a hidden quasar in3c 234. the line-rich spectrum and the steepness of the hard x-ray continuum(gamma ~ 1.7) found in this source weaken the hypothesis that the bulk ofthex-ray emission in radio-loud agns with high excitation optical lines arisesfrom jet non-thermal emission.

1310.7701	the properties of the clumpy torus and blr in the polar-scattered  seyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77 through x-ray absorption variability	we report results from multi-epoch x-ray observations of the polar-scatteredseyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77. the source exhibits remarkable spectralvariability from months to years timescales. the observed spectral variabilityis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorbertowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. the column density is generallycompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. however, one observation reveals a compton-thick statewith column density of the order of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of thex-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. we identify variable x-ray absorptionfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individualclumps have a density of $\leq$ 1.7 $\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an averagecolumn density of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broadline region (blr), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\times$10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. thederived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torushalf-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\circ$. we also confirm thepreviously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflowvelocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. the observed outflow velocities areconsistent with the keplerian/escape velocity at the blr. hence, the warmabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud mediumwhich ensures that the blr clouds are in pressure equilibrium with theirsurroundings. the blr line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumpsof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggestedby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during ourmonitoring.

1311.6633	first x-ray observations of low-power compact steep spectrum sources	we report first x-ray chandra observations of a sample of seven lowluminosity compact (llc) sources. they belong to a class of young compact steepspectrum (css) radio sources. four of them have been detected, the other threehave upper limit estimations for x-ray flux, one css galaxy is associated withan x-ray cluster. we have used the new observations together with theobservational data for known strong css and gigahertz-peaked spectrum (gps)objects and large scale fris and friis to study the relation betweenmorphology, x-ray properties and excitation modes in radio-loud agns. we foundthat: (1) the low power objects fit well to the already established x-ray -radio luminosity correlation for agns and occupy the space among, weaker in thex-rays, fri objects. (2) the high excitation galaxies (heg) and low excitationgalaxies (leg) occupy distinct locus in the radio/x-ray luminosity plane,notwithstanding their evolutionary stage. this is in agreement with thepostulated different origin of the x-ray emission in these two group ofobjects. (3) we have tested the agn evolution models by comparing theradio/x-ray luminosity ratio with the size of the sources, and indirectly, withtheir age. we conclude that the division for two different x-ray emissionmodes, namely originate in the base of the relativistic jet (fris) or in theaccretion disk (friis) is already present among the younger compact agns. (4)finally, we found that the css sources are less obscured than the more compactgpss in x-rays. however, the anti-correlation between x-ray column density andradio size does not hold for the whole sample of gps and css objects.

1406.7252	ultra-fast outflows in radio-loud active galactic nuclei	recent x-ray observations show absorbing winds with velocities up tomildly-relativistic values of the order of ~0.1c in a limited sample of 6broad-line radio galaxies. they are observed as blue-shifted fe xxv-xxvik-shell absorption lines, similarly to the ultra-fast outflows (ufos) reportedin seyferts and quasars. in this work we extend the search for such fe kabsorption lines to a larger sample of 26 radio-loud agns observed withxmm-newton and suzaku. the sample is drawn from the swift bat 58-month catalogand blazars are excluded. x-ray bright fr ii radio galaxies constitute themajority of the sources. combining the results of this analysis with those inthe literature we find that ufos are detected in &gt;27% of the sources. however,correcting for the number of spectra with insufficient signal-to-noise, we canestimate that the incidence of ufos is this sample of radio-loud agns is likelyin the range f=(50+/-20)%. a photo-ionization modeling of the absorption lineswith xstar allows to estimate the distribution of their main parameters. theobserved outflow velocities are broadly distributed between v_out&lt;1,000 km s^-1and v_out~0.4c, with mean and median values of v_out~0.133c and v_out~0.117c,respectively. the material is highly ionized, with an average ionizationparameter of log\xi~4.5 erg s^-1 cm, and the column densities are larger thann_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. overall, these characteristics are consistent with thepresence of complex accretion disk winds in a significant fraction ofradio-loud agns and demonstrate that the presence of relativistic jets does notpreclude the existence of winds, in accordance with several theoretical models.

0803.2520	the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 335 at a very low flux state: mapping the soft  x-ray photoionised gas	this paper reports on an xmm-newton observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk335 performed as a target of opportunity when the source was in an unusuallylow flux state. the low level of continuum emission unveiled an underlyingline-rich soft x-ray spectrum, which can be studied with the reflection gratingspectrometer. the emission features have been analysed at high resolution withunprecedented detail for this source. line ratios diagnostic from h-like andhe-like ions indicates that the line emission arises in x-ray photoionisedplasma. extensive simulations have been performed with the cloudyphotoionisation code. from the comparison of the expected and observed lineintensities the physical properties of the line emitting material were derived.because of the degeneracy in the ionisation parameter, a number of differentsolutions in terms of electron density and column density of the gas areconsistent with the spectral diagnostics. this prevents us from determininguniquely the properties of the plasma; however, the location(s) of the x-rayphotoionised gas can be constrained to be within 0.06 pc (outer boundary). thislimit places the x-ray line emitting gas at the inner edge of the materialwhere the broad optical lines are produced (broad line region).

1409.3406	xmm-newton observations reveal the disappearance of the wind in 4u  1630-47	we report on xmm-newton observations of the black hole x-ray binary 4u1630-47 during its 2012-2013 outburst. the first five observations monitor thesource as its luminosity increases across the high-soft state of accretion. inthe sixth observation the source has made a transition to an "anomalous" state,characterised by a significant contribution of electron scattering. athermally/radiatively driven disc wind is present in the first fourobservations, which becomes more photoionised as the luminosity increases withtime. in the fifth observation, the wind is not observed any more as aconsequence of strong photoionisation and the low sensitivity of thisobservation. this overall trend is then consistent with a fully ionised windcausing the electron scattering characteristic of the anomalous state in thesixth observation. a broad iron emission line co-exists with the absorptionfeatures from the wind in the first four observations but is not visible in thelast two observations. we find that the changes in the state of the wind asmeasured from modelling the absorption features with a self-consistent warmabsorber model are correlated to the changes in the broad iron line. when thelatter is modeled with a reflection component we find that the reflectionfraction decreases as the illumination increases. we propose that the changesin both the absorption and broad emission lines are caused by the increasingluminosity and temperature of the accretion disc along the soft state. suchchanges ultimately enable the transition to a state where the wind is fullyionised and consequently comptonisation plays a significant role.

1409.7112	testing rate dependent corrections on timing mode epic-pn spectra of the  accreting neutron star gx 13+1	when the epic-pn instrument on board xmm-newton is operated in timing mode,high count rates (&gt;100 cts/s) of bright sources may affect the calibration ofthe energy scale, resulting in a modification of the real spectral shape. thecorrections related to this effect are then strongly important in the study ofthe spectral properties. tests of these calibrations are more suitable insources which spectra are characterised by a large number of discrete features.therefore, in this work, we carried out a spectral analysis of the accretingneutron star gx 13+1, which is a dipping source with several narrow absorptionlines and a broad emission line in its spectrum. we tested two differentcorrection approaches on an xmm-newton epic-pn observation taken in timingmode: the standard rate dependent cti (rdcti or epfast) and the new, ratedependent pulse height amplitude (rdpha) corrections. we found that, ingeneral, the two corrections marginally affect the properties of the overallbroadband continuum, while hints of differences in the broad emission linespectral shape are seen. on the other hand, they are dramatically important forthe centroid energy of the absorption lines. in particular, the rdphacorrections provide a better estimate of the spectral properties of thesefeatures than the rdcti corrections. indeed the discrete features observed inthe data, applying the former method, are physically more consistent with thosealready found in other chandra and xmm-newton observations of gx 13+1.

1508.04565	a variable-density absorption event in ngc 3227 mapped with suzaku and  swift	the morphology of the circumnuclear gas accreting onto supermassive blackholes in seyfert galaxies remains a topic of much debate. as the innermostregions of active galactic nuclei (agn) are spatially unresolved, x-rayspectroscopy, and in particular line-of-sight absorption variability, is a keydiagnostic to map out the distribution of gas. observations of variable x-rayabsorption in multiple seyferts and over a wide range of timescales indicatethe presence of clumps/clouds of gas within the circumnuclear material. eclipseevents by clumps transiting the line of sight allow us to explore theproperties of the clumps over a wide range of radial distances from theoptical/uv broad line region (blr) to beyond the dust sublimation radius.time-resolved absorption events have been extremely rare so far, but suggest arange of density profiles across seyferts. we resolve a weeks-long absorptionevent in the seyfert ngc 3227. we examine six suzaku and twelve swiftobservations from a 2008 campaign spanning 5 weeks. we use a model accountingfor the complex spectral interplay of three differently-ionized absorbers. weperform time-resolved spectroscopy to discern the absorption variabilitybehavior. we also examine the ir-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) totest for reddening by dust. the 2008 absorption event is due tomoderately-ionized ($\log \xi\sim 1.2-1.4$) gas covering 90% of the line ofsight. we resolve the density profile to be highly irregular, in contrast to aprevious symmetric and centrally-peaked event mapped with rxte in the sameobject. the uv data do not show significant reddening, suggesting that thecloud is dust-free. the 2008 campaign has revealed a transit by a filamentary,moderately-ionized cloud of variable density that is likely located in the blr,and possibly part of a disk wind.

1512.03611	x-ray detection of warm ionized matter in the galactic halo	we report on a systematic investigation of the cold and mildly ionizedgaseous baryonic metal components of our galaxy, through the analysis of highresolution chandra and xmm-newton spectra of two samples of galactic andextragalactic sources. the comparison between lines of sight towards sourceslocated in the disk of our galaxy and extragalactic sources, allows us for thefirst time to clearly distinguish between gaseous metal components in the diskand halo of our galaxy. we find that a warm ionized metal medium (wimm)permeates a large volume above and below the galaxy's disk, perhaps up to thecircum-galactic space (cgm). this halo-wimm imprints virtually the totality ofthe oi and oii absorption seen in the spectra of our extragalactic targets, hasa temperature of t(halo-wimm)=2900 +/- 900 k, a density &lt;n_h&gt;(halo-wimm) =0.023 +/- 0.009 cm-3 and a metallicity z(halo-wimm) = (0.4 +/- 0.1) z_solar.consistently with previous works, we also confirm that the disk of the galaxycontains at least two distinct gaseous metal components, one cold and neutral(the cnmm: cold neutral metal medium) and one warm and mildly ionized, with thesame temperature of the halo-wimm, but higher density (&lt;n_h&gt;(disk-wimm) = 0.09+/- 0.03 cm-3) and metallicity (z(disk-wimm) = 0.8 +/- 0.1$ z_solar). byadopting a simple disk+sphere geometry for the galaxy, we estimates masses ofthe cnmm and the total (disk + halo) wimm of m(cnmm) &lt;~ 8e8 solar masses andm(wimm) ~ 8.2e9 solar masses.

astro-ph;0001371	a direct view of the agn powering iras12393+3520	we report the first direct x-ray evidence that an agn is hidden in the centerof iras12393+3520. an asca observation of this target unveiled a bright (0.5-10kev luminosity 3.9 x 10^42 erg/s) and variable source, with minimum observeddoubling/halving time scale comprised in the range 30-75 ks. a model composedby a simple power-law, with photon index ~1.8 and an absorption edge, whosethreshold energy is consistent with k-shell photoionization of ovii, providesan adequate fit of the spectrum. this suggests that we are observing theemission from the nuclear region through a warm absorber of n_h a few10^{21}/cm/cm. if it has internal dust with galactic gas-to-dust ratio, itcould explain the lack of broad hbeta emission, even in the episodic presenceof a broad halpha emission line. optical spectra obtained over several yearsshow indeed variations in the strength of this broad halpha component. adistribution of dusty, optically thick matter on spatial scales a few hundredsparsec, which does not intercept the line of sight towards the nucleus, isprobably required to account simultaneously for the relative [oiii] luminositydeficit in comparison to the x-rays. the high ir to x-ray luminosity ratio ismost likely due to intense star formation in the circumnuclear region.iras12393+3520 might thus exhibit simultaneously nuclear activity andremarkable star formation.

astro-ph;0001528	a broadband x-ray view of ngc4945	we present the results of a bepposax observation of the nearby spiral galaxyngc4945 in the 0.1-200 kev energy band. the nuclear x-ray emission emergesabove ~7 kev, through an absorber with column density n_h ~ a few 10^24/cm/cm.its remarkable variability (doubling/halving timescale ~10^4 s) is notassociated with any appreciable spectral changes, ruling out variations of theinterposed absorber or changes in the primary continuum shape. the intense ironk-alpha fluorescent emission line is likely to be produced by the same nuclearabsorbing matter. our estimate of the intrinsic nuclear power suggests that theactive nucleus dominates the bolometric energy output of ngc4945, if itsnucleus has a typical quasar l_x/l(bol) ratio. this supports the idea thatx-rays are the best energy band to search for absorbed agn. the 0.1-5 kevemission is extended along the plane of the galaxy, and most likely due to apopulation of unresolved binaries, as believed to happen in several early-typegalaxies. alternatively, hot gas associated with a starburst-driven superwindoutflow could substantially contribute to the extended emission above 1 kev.

astro-ph;0107372	bepposax spectroscopy of mr 2251-178: a test for ionized reflection in  radio quiet qsos	we present the 0.1-200 kev bepposax spectrum of mr 2251-178 observed at twoepochs in 1998 separated by 5 months. both epochs show identical spectral shapeand x-ray flux. analysis of the combined spectra allow us to confirm thepresence of the ionized fe k-alpha line detected by asca and to test thepresence of reflection from ionized material. the best self-consistent spectralfit is obtained when including a contribution from a mildly ionized reflector(xi(0.01-100) ~ 1625 erg cm s-1, i.e. u(0.1-10) ~ 0.14) with a reflectionfraction r_ion ~ 0.11. an exponential cut-off to the direct power-law continuumis then required at e ~ 100 kev. the low energy spectrum is absorbed by ionizedmatter with a column density n_w = (8.1 (-1.2/+2.1))*10^21 cm^-2 and an x-rayionization parameter u(0.1-10)= 0.06 +/- 0.01. the warm absorber column isslightly lower than that measured with asca. this change could be caused bybulk motion. the bepposax absorber ionization parameter globally agrees withthe ``u versus flux'' correlation found for mr 2251-178 with exosat, ginga andasca. this suggests that the absorber is in a state of instantaneous ionizationequilibrium.

astro-ph;0205045	compton reflection and iron fluorescence in bepposax observations of  seyfert type 1 galaxies	a sample of nine bright seyfert 1 and nelg type galaxies, observed withbepposax, is analyzed to assess on a truly broad band basis (0.1-200 kev) theissue of the spectral contributions of compton reflection and iron linefluorescence from circumnuclear gas. the empirical description adopted for thedirect continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off.the most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalentwidth of the line, walpha, and the strength r of the reflection relative to thedirect continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantiallypositive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, andonly a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. the existence of asteep correlation between r and the slope gamma of the power law is notconfirmed. a weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trendto increase on average with gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both r andwalpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. the energy ef in theexponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 kev. apossible correlation is found, with ef increasing on average with gamma: ifignored, for instance by keeping ef at a fixed value in a sample study, itcould be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between r and gamma.

astro-ph;0401607	relativistic spectral features from x-ray illuminated spots and the  measure of the black hole mass in agn	narrow spectral features in the 5--6 kev range were recently discovered inthe x-ray spectra of a few active galactic nuclei. we discuss the possibilitythat these features are due to localized spots which occur on the surface of anaccretion disc following its illumination by flares. we present detailed lineprofiles as a function of orbital phase of the spot and its radial distancefrom a central black hole. comparison of these computed profiles with observedfeatures can help to estimate parameters of the system. in principle thismethod can provide a powerful tool to measure the mass of super-massive blackholes in active galactic nuclei. by comparing our simulations with the chandraand xmm-newton results, we show, however, that spectra from present generationx-ray satellites are not of good enough quality to fully exploit the method anddetermine the black hole mass with sufficient accuracy. this task has to bedeferred to future missions with high throughput and high energy resolution,such as constellation-x and xeus.

astro-ph;0402639	drilled by the jet? xmm-newton discovers a compton-thick agn in the gps  galaxy mkn668	we report the xmm-newton discovery of the first compton-thick obscured agn ina broad line radio galaxy, the gigahertz peaked-spectrum source mkn668(oq+208). the remarkably flat 2-10 kev x-ray spectrum (observed photon index,\gamma ~ 0.7), alongside with a prominent iron k-alpha fluorescent emissionline, is a clear signature of a compton-reflection dominated spectrum. mkn688represents a remarkable example of discrepancy between x-ray spectralproperties and optical classification, as its optical spectrum is characterizedby broad and asymmetric balmer lines. the obscuring matter is constrained to belocated within the radio hotspots, in turn separated by about 10 pc. if thejets are piercing their way through a compton-thick medium pervading thenuclear environment, one could be largely underestimating the radio activitydynamical age determined from the observed hotspot recession velocity. the softx-ray spectrum is dominated by a much steeper component, which may be due tonuclear continuum electron scattering, or inverse compton of the - remarkablylarge - far infrared emission. soft x-rays are suppressed by a furthercompton-thin (n_h ~ 10^21/cm/cm) absorbing system, that we identify with matterresponsible for free-free absorption of the radio lobes.

astro-ph;0404263	evidence for a multizone warm absorber in the xmm-newton spectrum of  markarian 304	we present a xmm-newton observation of markarian 304, a seyfert 1 galaxy at z= 0.066. the epic data show that mkn 304 is affected by heavy (nh ~10^{23}cm{-2}) obscuration due to ionized gas. a two-phase warm absorber provides anadequate parameterization of this gas. the ionization parameter of the twocomponents is \xi ~6 erg/cm2/s and \xi ~90 erg/cm2/s, respectively. theobserved continuum photon index (gamma ~1.9) is typical for seyfert 1 galaxies.two significant emission lines are detected at 0.57 kev and 6.4 kev,respectively. the former is mostly likely due to he-like oxygen tripletemission arising from an ionized plasma (maybe the warm absorber itself). thelatter is due to fluorescent emission of k-shell iron in a low-ionization state(fei--xv). the upper limit for the line width of sigma_{k\alpha} &lt;0.18 kev mostlikely rules out an origin in the inner parts of the accretion disk.interestingly, the strength of such line is consistent with the possibilitythat the emission is produced in the warm absorber itself. however, asubstantial contribution from the torus is plausible too. we have also found aweak (4% of the primary continuum) soft excess emission component. the presenceof this excess could be explained by either emission/scattering from a warm gasor partial covering, or a combination of them.

astro-ph;0404308	x-ray reprocessing in seyfert galaxies: simultaneous xmm-newton/bepposax  observations	we selected a sample of eight bright unobscured (at least at the iron lineenergy) seyfert galaxies observed simultaneously by xmm-newton and bepposax,taking advantage of the complementary characteristics of the two missions. themain results of our analysis can be summarized as follows: narrow neutral ironlines are confirmed to be an ubiquitous component in seyfert spectra; none ofthe analyzed sources shows unambiguously a broad relativistic iron line; allthe sources of our sample (with a single exception) show the presence of acompton reflection component; emission lines from ionized iron are observed insome sources; peculiar weak features around 5-6 kev (possibly arising fromrotating spots on the accretion disk) are detected in two sources. the scenarioemerging from these results strongly requires some corrections for theclassical model of reprocessing from the accretion disk. as for materialsfarther away from the black hole, our results represent a positive test for theunification model, suggesting the presence of the torus in (almost) allsources, even if unobscured.

astro-ph;0408300	unveiling the nature of the highly obscured agn in ngc5643 with  xmm-newton	we present results from an xmm-newton observation of the nearby seyfert 2galaxy ngc5643. the nucleus exhibits a very flat x-ray continuum above 2 kev,together with a prominent k-alpha fluorescent iron line. this indicates heavyobscuration. we measure an absorbing column density n_h in the range 6-10 x10^{23} atoms/cm/cm, either directly covering the nuclear emission, or coveringits compton-reflection. in the latter case, we might be observing a ratherunusual geometry for the absorber, whereby reflection from the inner far sideof a torus is in turn obscured by its near side outer atmosphere. the nuclearemission might be then either covered by a compton-thick absorber, orundergoing a transient state of low activity. a second source (christened "x-1"in this paper) at the outskirts of ngc5643 optical surface outshines thenucleus in x-rays. if belonging to ngc5643, it is the third brightest (l_x ~ 4x 10^{40} erg/s) known ultra luminous x-ray source. comparison with past largeaperture spectra of ngc 5643 unveils dramatic x-ray spectral changes above 1kev. we interpret them as due to variability of the active nucleus and ofsource x-1 intrinsic x-ray powers by a factor &gt;10 and 5, respectively.

astro-ph;0409689	on the transmission- to reprocessing-dominated spectral state  transitions in seyfert 2 galaxies	we present chandra and xmm-newton observations of a small sample (11 objects)of optically-selected seyfert~2 galaxies, for which asca and bepposax hadsuggested compton-thick obscuration of the active nucleus (agn). the main goalof this study is to estimate the rate of transitions between "transmission-"and "reprocessing-dominated" states. we discover one new transition in ngc4939,with a possible additional candidate in ngc5643. this indicates a typicaloccurrence rate of at least ~0.02/year. these transitions could be due to largechanges of the obscuring gas column density, or to a transient dimming of theagn activity, the latter scenario being supported by detailed analysis of thebest studied events. independently of the ultimate mechanism, comparison of theobserved spectral dynamics with monte-carlo simulations demonstrates that theobscuring gas is largely inhomogeneous, with multiple absorbing componentspossibly spread through the whole range of distances from the nucleus between afraction of parsecs up to several hundreds parsecs. as a by-product of thisstudy, we report the first measurement ever of the column density covering theagn in ngc3393 (n_h ~ 4.4x10^{24} atoms/cm/cm), and the discovery of soft x-rayextended emission, apparently aligned along the host galaxy main axis inngc5005. the latter object hosts most likely an historically misclassifiedlow-luminosity compton-thin agn.

astro-ph;0411051	the xmm-newton view of pg quasars i. x-ray continuum and absorption	we present results of a systematic analysis of the xmm-newton spectra of 40quasars (qsos) (z&lt;1.72) from the palomar-green (pg) bright quasar survey sample(m_b&lt;-23). the sample includes 35 radio-quiet quasars (rqqs) and 5 radio-loudquasars (rlqs). the analysis of the spectra above 2 kev reveals that the hardx-ray continuum emission can be modeled with a power law component with&lt;gamma_(2-12)&gt; = 1.89+/-0.11 and &lt;gamma_(2-12)&gt; = 1.63^(+0.02)_(-0.01) for therqqs and rlqs, respectively. below 2 kev, a strong, broad excess is present inmost qso spectra. this feature has been fitted with four different modelsassuming several physical scenarios. all tested models (blackbody, multicolorblackbody, bremsstrahlung and power law) satisfactorily fitted the majority ofthe spectra. however, none of them is able to provide an adequateparameterization for the soft excess emission in all qsos, indicating theabsence of an universal shape for this spectral feature. an additional coldabsorption component was required only in three sources. on the other hand, asrecently pointed out by porquet et al. (2004) for a smaller sample of pg qsos,warm absorber features are present in ~50% of the qso spectra in contrast withtheir rare occurrence (~5-10%) found in previous studies. the xmm-newton viewof optically-selected bright qsos therefore suggests that there are nosignificant difference in the x-ray spectral properties once compared with thelow-luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies. properties of the fe kalpha emission linesare presented in a companion paper.

astro-ph;0506762	x-ray emission from ngc 1808: more than a complex starburst	earlier observations of ngc 1808 in various wavebands (x-ray, optical,near-infrared, radio) provided evidence for the existence of either a starburstor a seyfert 2 nucleus. we here present the results of multiwavelengthxmm-newton and chandra observations, which directly prove the co-existence ofthermal diffuse plasma and non-nuclear unresolved point-like sources associatedwith the starburst activity, along with a low luminosity active galacticnucleus (llagn) or an ultra luminous x-ray source (ulx). the broad bandwidth ofxmm-newton allows us to show that the unresolved nuclear source in ngc 1808dominates the hard x-ray spectrum, while the emission in the soft regime, below1 kev, is dominated by a thermal component associated to an extended starburst.both epic and rgs data provide reliable detections of a number of emissionlines from heavy elements, with abundances ranging from roughly 0.7 to 2.2z_sol for different elements. however, no 6.4 kev fe k-alpha fluorescence lineemission was detected. the analysis of the nuclear region of ngc 1808 allows usto detect and disentangle the contribution of an unresolved nuclear x-raysource and the starburst region, but the exact nature of the nucleus remainsunknown. the observed luminosity of ngc 1808 is l(2-10 kev)=(1.61+/-0.06)e+40erg/s. a comparison of our om 212 nm image with a ctio 4-m telescope h-alphaframe shows a good general correspondence between the emission from massivestars and warm ionized gas, with minor deviations near the ends of the bar inngc 1808. an aditional, very soft thermal spectral component with kt~0.1 kevhas been discovered in the xmm-newton spectral analysis, which most likelyoriginates from the halo of ngc 1808.

astro-ph;0507323	a search for changing-look agn in the grossan catalog	we observed with xmm-newton 4 objects selected from the grossan catalog, withthe aim to search for new 'changing-look' agn. the sample includes all thesources which showed in subsequent observations a flux much lower than the onemeasured with heao a-1: ngc 7674, ngc 4968, iras 13218+0552 and ngc 1667. noneof the sources was caught in a high flux state during the xmm-newtonobservations, whose analysis reveal they are all likely compton-thick objects.we suggest that, for all the sources, potential problems with the heao a-1source identification and flux measurement prevent us from being certain thatthe heao a-1 data represent a putative 'high' state for these objects.nonetheless, based on the high flux state and compton-thin spectrum of itsginga observation, ngc 7674 represents probably the sixth known case of a'changing-look' seyfert 2 galaxy. from the x-ray variability pattern, we canestimate a likely lower limit of a few parsec to the distance of the innerwalls of the torus in this object. remarkably, iras 13218+0552 was not detectedby xmm-newton, despite being currently classified as a seyfert 1 with a large[oiii] flux. however, the original classification was likely to be affected byan extreme velocity outflow component in the emission lines. the object likelyharbors an highly obscured agn and should be re-classified as a type 2 source.

astro-ph;0702564	xmm-newton broad-band observations of ngc 7582: nh variations and fading  out of the active nucleus	we present results from two xmm-newton observations of the bright classicalseyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7582 taken four years apart (2001 may and 2005 april). wepresent the analysis of the high-resolution (0.3-1 kev) rgs and low-resolution(0.3-10 kev) epic spectroscopic data. a comparison with a 1998 bepposaxobservation suggests that xmm-newton caught the source in a`reflection-dominated' phase, measuring the lowest continuum flux level ever(f(2-10 kev) = 2.3 x 10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1) in 2005. ngc 7582 thereforeexperienced a dramatic spectral transition most likely due to the partialswitching-off of the nuclear activity. the xmm-newton spectrum of the continuumemission is very complex. it can be well described by a model consisting of acombination of a heavily absorbed (nh ~ 10^(24) cm^-2) power law and a purereflection component both obscured by a column density of ~ 4 x 10^(22) cm^-2.notably, we detect a significant increase by a factor of ~2 in the columndensity of the inner, thicker absorber covering the primary x-ray sourcebetween 2001 and 2005. the 2005 xmm-newton spectra show the strongest fe kalphaemission line ever measured in this source. this is consistent with the linedelayed time response to the decrease of the nuclear activity. our analysisalso reveals that the soft x-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines fromhighly ionized metals. the detection of a narrow oviii radiative recombinationcontinuum suggests an origin in a photoionized plasma.

astro-ph;9707042	bepposax observation of the x-ray binary pulsar vela x-1	we report on the spectral (pulse averaged) and timing analysis of the ~ 20ksec observation of the x-ray binary pulsar vela x-1 performed during thebepposax science verification phase. the source was observed in two differentintensity states: the low state is probably due to an erratic intensity dip andshows a decrease of a factor ~ 2 in intensity, and a factor 10 in nh. we havenot been able to fit the 2-100 kev continuum spectrum with the standard (for anx--ray pulsar) power law modified by a high energy cutoff because of theflattening of the spectrum in ~ 10-30 kev. the timing analysis confirmsprevious results: the pulse profile changes from a five-peak structure forenergies less than 15 kev, to a simpler two-peak shape at higher energies. thefourier analysis shows a very complex harmonic component: up to 23 harmonicsare clearly visible in the power spectrum, with a dominant first harmonic forlow energy data, and a second one as the more prominent for energies greaterthan 15 kev. the aperiodic component in the vela x-1 power spectrum presents aknee at about 1 hz. the pulse period, corrected for binary motion, is 283.206+/- 0.001 sec.

astro-ph;9711215	the vela x-1 pulse-averaged spectrum as observed by bepposax	we report on the 20 ksec observation of vela x-1 performed by bepposax on1996 july 14 during its science verification phase. we observed the source intwo intensity states, characterized by a change in luminosity of a factor ~ 2,and a change in absorption of a factor ~ 10. the single narrow field instrumentpulse-averaged spectra are well fit by a power law with significantly differentindices. this is in agreement with the observed changes of slope in thewide-band spectrum: a first change of slope at ~ 10 kev, and a second one at ~35 kev. to mimic this behaviour we used a double power law modified by anexponential cutoff --- the so-called npex model --- to fit the whole 2-100 kevcontinuum. this functional is able to adequately describe the data, expeciallythe low intensity state. we found an absorption-like feature at ~ 57 kev, verywell visible in the ratio performed with the crab spectrum. we interpreted thisfeature as a cyclotron resonance, corresponding to a neutron star surfacemagnetic strength of 4.9 x 10^12 gauss. the bepposax data do not require thepresence of a cyclotron resonance at ~ 27 kev as found in earlier works.

astro-ph;9804299	bepposax spectral survey of soft x-ray selected bl lacs	we present x-ray spectra obtained with bepposax (satellite per astronomia x)of 10 bl lac objects, selected from the einstein medium sensitivity and slewsurveys. we find that in about half of the objects a fit in the 0.1-10 kevrange with a single power law and free absorption yields values of nh largerthan the galactic ones. in most of these cases, however, broken power law fitswith nh fixed at the galactic values yield an alternative, better descriptionof the data and indicate a steepening of the spectrum with increasing energy.one object (1es1101-232) is detected up to ~100 kev. its spectral energydistribution (sed) peaks in the medium energy x-ray band. for each object wecompute the peak frequency of the sed from multifrequency data. the spectralindices alpha_x in the 2-10 kev band (fnu prop to nu^{-alpha_x}) are smaller(i.e. flatter spectrum) for objects with higher peak frequencies. we thereforeconfirm and extend to higher energies the behavior already known for x-rayselected bl lac objects in the rosat band. we do not find spectral indicessmaller than 1; however, the flat distribution of alpha_x and the correlationbetween alpha_x and peak frequency found from our data suggest that a number ofobjects may exist, which in the quiescent status have flatter spectrum and peakfrequency in the hard x-ray range.

astro-ph;9808009	1h0419-577: a "two-state" soft x-ray seyfert galaxy	in this paper we report on the first simultaneous optical and x-ray(beppo-sax) observations of the radio-quiet agn 1h0419-577. the opticalspectrum clearly leads us to classify this source as a seyfert 1. the x-rayspectrum is, however, somewhat at odds with this classification: a simple flat(gamma ~ 1.55) and featureless power--law is a good description of the whole1.8-40 kev spectrum, even if the upper limit to a broad iron line is not verytight. an analysis of a still unpublished rosat observation of the same targetreveals that the soft x-ray spectrum has undergone a transition from a steep(gamma ~ 2.5) to a flat (gamma ~ 1.55) state, at least in the 0.7-2 kev band.if this difference is due to a remarkably variable soft excess, it is unlikelythat a single component is responsible for the optical/uv/soft x-ray spectraldistribution. the hypothesis that the difference is due to a change in theprimary x-ray continuum and its implications for current comptonization modelsare discussed.

astro-ph;9809013	evidence for ionized reprocessing in the x-ray spectrum of the seyfert 1  galaxy 1e1615+061	the seyfert 1 galaxy 1e1615+061 was observed to display a very steep andintense soft x-ray spectrum during a heao-1 a2 observation in the 1978. such anexceptionally soft x-ray state has never been observed subsequently, but thesource has continued to exhibit a large (up to a factor 6) range of x-rayintensity variability. the overall uv/x-ray spectrum of this source, observedduring a multiwavelength campaign in 1991-1992, can be well fit with aself-consistent, low-m-dot accretion disk model. in this model, the soft x-raysresult were suggested to arise from reflection of the nuclear emission bymildly ionized material in the inner regions of the disk. in this paper wereport the results of an asca observation in 1995 august, which give a directconfirmation of such a scenario. the spectrum may be modeled as a power-lawwith a photon index of 1.8, together with absorption consistent with thegalactic line of sight value, substantial reflection from ionized material andan iron fluorescent k-alpha emission line. the centroid energy (~6.6--6.8 kev)implies a ionization stage &gt;fe xix. the line profile is consistent with thatexpected from a kinematically and gravitationally distorted line around a blackhole. these results provide the first direct evidence for the existence ofconsiderable amount of ionized material around the nucleus of a "broad" seyfert1 galaxy.

astro-ph;9809356	the absorption properties of gamma-ray burst afterglows measured by  bepposax	we present an analysis of the x-ray absorption properties of 6 gamma-rayburst (grb) afterglows measured with bepposax. between 8 hrs and 20 hrs afterthe initial grb trigger, individual spectra can be described by a power-lawwith a photon index of ~2 and absorption marginally consistent with thegalactic value. taken collectively, the data are inconsistent with zeroabsorption at the &gt;99.999 confidence level. the data are only marginallyconsistent with a distribution of column densities varying as the totalgalactic absorption in the direction of each of the bursts (chi^2 =9.6 for 6degrees of freedom). the data are consistent with cosmological models in whichgrb occur within host galaxies. by simultaneously fitting a power-law spectralmodel with absorption fixed at the galactic value and additional, redshifted,absorption to all 6 afterglow spectra, the best-fit average absorption withinthe host objects is found to be (1.01 ^0.28_0.51) 10^22 atom cm^-2. this valueis compatible with the host galaxy column densities inferred from optical datafor grb970508, grb971214 and grb980329, supporting the hypothesis that grboccur within heavily absorbed star forming regions of their host galaxies.

astro-ph;9810086	the quiescent state broadband x-ray spectrum and variability of mkn421	the bl lac object mkn~421 was observed three times by the x-ray observatorybepposax in consecutive days during 1997 april and may. the source was in aquiescent state, with an average 2-10 kev flux of 9.0 x 10^(-11) erg/cm/cm/s.flux variation by a factor of ~2 on timescales as short as a few 10 ks weremore pronounced in the hard (i.e. above ~3 kev) than in the soft x-rays. thebroadband (0.1-40 kev) spectrum is concave and can be most easily explainedwith a power-law model which steepens gradually with energy. in this framework,neither photoabsorption edges nor resonant absorption lines are required,strengthening the case against the ubiquity of such features in bl lac objects,which had been previously suggested by einstein observations. the broadbandspectrum hardens with hard x-ray flux, mostly due to a flattening above ~4 kev.this suggests that the relativistic highest energy electron distributionproperties drive the x-ray spectral dynamics: either a stratification of thedistribution in the jet with energy or inhomogeneities in the electroninjection mechanism could be consistent with the observed variability pattern.

astro-ph;9810450	reprocessing and variable cold absorption in the broad-line radio galaxy  3c390.3	a bepposax observation of the blrg 3c390.3 is reported. for the first time,both the 6.4 kev iron line and a strong reflection hump, produced by theillumination of the primary x-ray emission on cold matter, are detected in thissource. the 0.1-100 kev continuum is modeled by an absorbed power law (\gamma~1.8) reflected at high energies by material with a fairly large covering factor(\omega/2\pi~1). the iron line is intrinsically narrow ($\sigma=73(+207,-73)ev) and has an equivalent width of ~140$ ev. we discuss the results in thecontext of current models for agns and suggest that the primary x-ray power lawcontinuum is probably produced by a hot inner flow, while the reprocessedradiation comes from an outer cold thin disk, and/or from a thick torus at evenlarger radii. further observations with bepposax could distinguish between thelatter two cases. beamed radiation associated to the radio jet is unlikely tocontribute significantly to the x-ray emission. finally, an historical study ofthe column density nh, also reported here, shows that the absorption along theline of sight changes in time. the nh time variability, which is not correlatedwith that of the primary continuum, seems to imply variations of the geometryof the absorber rather than variations in the ionization state of the gas.

astro-ph;9902022	bepposax observations of mkn 3: piercing through the torus of a seyfert  2 galaxy	a new bepposax broad-band (0.6-150 kev) spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy mkn3 is presented. the spectrum provides a direct measurement of a large, neutralcolumn of gas with nh~10**24 cm**-2 in the source direction. the source, asbright as 3c 273 above 10 kev, has a steep (gamma~1.8) spectrum without anyevidence of a high-energy cutoff up to at least 150 kev. at lower energies, thedata are best modeled with the addition of an unabsorbed reflection component.combining these data with previous ginga and asca observations, the fek$_{\alpha}$ and reflection continuum indicate that the reprocessed emission isresponding slower than the intrinsic continuum variations suggesting a size ofthe reprocessor &gt;= 2 pc. identifying such a reprocessor with a (close toedge-on) obscuring torus, the overall result fits well into unified modelssince, presumably, one can interpret the strong absorption as due totransmission through the rim of the torus and the unabsorbed (directly viewed)reflection component as due to reprocessing from the torus inner surface.

astro-ph;9902075	bepposax lecs background subtraction techniques	we present 3 methods for the subtraction of non-cosmic and unresolved cosmicbackgrounds observed by the low-energy concentrator spectrometer (lecs)on-board bepposax. removal of these backgrounds allows a more accurate modelingof the spectral data from point and small-scale extended sources. at high(&gt;|25| degree) galactic latitudes, subtraction using a standard backgroundspectrum works well. at low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of thex-ray sky, two alternative methods are presented. the first uses countsobtained from two semi-annuli near the outside of the lecs field of view toestimate the background at the source location. the second method uses rosatposition sensitive proportional counter (pspc) all-sky survey data to estimatethe lecs background spectrum for a given pointing position. a comparison of theresults from these methods provides an estimate of the systematicuncertainties. for high galactic latitude fields, all 3 methods give 3 sigmaconfidence uncertainties of &lt;0.9 10^-3 count/s (0.1-10 kev), or &lt;1.5 10^-3count/s (0.1-2 kev). these correspond to 0.1-2.0 kev fluxes of 0.7-1.8 and0.5-1.1 10^-13 erg/cm2/s for a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 andphotoelectric absorption of 3 10^20 and 3 10^21 atom/cm2, respectively. at lowgalactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the x-ray sky, the uncertaintiesare a factor ~2.5 higher.

astro-ph;9903109	the low-energy cosmic x-ray background spectrum observed by the bepposax  lecs	the spectrum of the 0.1-7.0 kev cosmic x-ray background (cxb) at galacticlatitudes &gt;|25| degrees has been measured using the bepposax low-energyspectrometer concentrator (lecs). above 1 kev the spectrum is consistent with apower-law of photon index 1.47 +/- 0.10 and normalization 11.0 +/- 0.8 photoncm^-2 s^-1 kev^-1 sr^-1 at 1kev. the overall spectrum can be modeled by apower-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a singlethermal component. in both cases the softer thermal emission dominates at lessthan 0.3 kev and is seen through a column of a few 10^19 atom cm^-2. the othercomponents have columns consistent with the mean line of sight value. the metalabundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistentwith cosmic values. the power-law together with 2 thermal components model hasbeen used to fit recent combined asca and rosat cxb measurements. here, thesoft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble andthe hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region.while such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the lecs spectrum, itis not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequatemodeling of the extragalactic contribution. the observed low-energy spectralcomplexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. there isno evidence for the presence of a very soft cxb component with a temperature&lt;0.1 kev. the emission measure seen by rosat is rejected at 90% confidence.

astro-ph;9905104	the swansong in context: long-timescale x-ray variability of ngc 4051	on 9-11 may 1998, the highly-variable, low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxyngc4051 was observed in an unusual low flux state by bepposax (guainazzi et al.1998) rxte and euve. we present fits of the 4-15 kev rxte spectrum and bepposaxmecs spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with theinterpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum ofpure reflection from distant cold matter. we place this result in context byshowing the x-ray lightcurve of ngc4051 obtained by our rxte monitoringcampaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low statelasted for ~150 days before the may observations (implying that the reflectingmaterial is &gt; 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of alightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux overtimescales &gt; months. we show that the long-timescale component to x-rayvariability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct fromthe variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations inthe accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. as the sourceapproaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. ngc4051may represent a microcosm of all x-ray variability in radio quiet activegalactic nuclei (agns), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states andvariability properties which more luminous agns may pass through on timescalesof decades to thousands of years.

astro-ph;9905261	soft x-ray spectroscopy of compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxies with  bepposax	we present a x-ray spectroscopic study of the bright compton-thick seyfert 2sngc1068 and the circinus galaxy, performed with bepposax. matt et al. (1997 and1998) interpreted the spectrum above 4 kev as the superposition of comptonreflection and warm plasma scattering of the nuclear radiation. when thiscontinuum is extrapolated downwards to 0.1 kev, further components arise. thengc1068 spectrum is rich in emission lines, mainly due to k-alpha transitionsof he-like elements from oxygen to iron, plus a k-alpha fluorescent line fromneutral iron. if the ionized lines originate in the warm scatterer, its thermaland ionization structure must be complex. from the continuum and lineproperties, we estimate a column density, of the warm scatterer less than a few10^21 atoms/cm/cm. in the circinus galaxy, the absence of highly ionized ironis consistent with a scattering medium with ionization parameter u&lt;5 anddensity about a few times 10^22 atoms/cm/cm. in both cases the neutral ironline is most naturally explained as fluorescence in the medium responsible forthe compton reflection continuum. in ngc1068 an optically thin plasma emissionwith kt~500 ev and strongly sub-solar metallicity is required, while such acomponent is only marginal in the circinus galaxy. we tentatively identify thiscomponent as emission of diffuse hot gas in the nuclear starbursts. possiblecauses for the metal depletion are discussed.
