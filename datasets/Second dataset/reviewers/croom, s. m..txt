0902.1098	photometric selection of emission line galaxies, clustering analysis and  a search for the isw effect	we investigate the use of simple colour cuts applied to the sdss opticalimaging to perform photometric selections of emission line galaxies out to z&lt;1.  from colour-cuts using the sdss g, r and i bands, we obtain mean photometricredshifts of z=0.32+-0.08, z=0.44+-0.12 and z=0.65+-0.21. we further calibrateour high redshift selection using spectroscopic observations with the aaomegaspectrograph on the 4m anglo-australian telescope (aat), observing ~50-200galaxy candidates in 4 separate fields. with just 1-hour of integration timeand with seeing of ~1.6", we successfully determined redshifts for ~65% of thetargeted candidates. we calculate the angular correlation functions of thesamples and find correlation lengths of r0=2.64 h-1 mpc, r0=3.62 h-1 mpc andr0=5.88 h-1 mpc for the low, mid and high redshift samples respectively.comparing these results with predicted dark matter clustering, we estimate thebias parameter for each sample to be b=0.70, b=0.92 and b=1.46. we calculatethe 2-point redshift-space correlation function at z~0.6 and find a clusteringamplitude of s0=6.4 h-1 mpc. finally, we use our photometric sample to searchfor the integrated sachs-wolfe signal in the wmap 5yr data. we cross-correlateour three redshift samples with the wmap w, v, q and k bands and find anoverall trend for a positive signal similar to that expected from models.however, the signal in each is relatively weak. combining all three galaxysamples we find a signal of wtg(&lt;100')=0.20+-0.12 microk in the wmap w-band, asignificance of 1.7sigma.

0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

0911.1352	cross-correlating wmap5 with 1.5 million lrgs: a new test for the isw  effect	we present the cross-correlation of the density map of lrgs and thetemperature fluctuation in the cmb as measured by the wmap5 observations. thelrg samples were extracted from imaging data of the sdss based on two previousspectroscopic redshift surveys, the sdss-lrg and the 2slaq surveys at averageredshifts z~0.35 and z~0.55. in addition we have added a higher-redshiftphotometric lrg sample based on the selection of the aaomega lrg redshiftsurvey at z~0.7. the total lrg sample thus comprises 1.5 million galaxies,sampling a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 over ~7600 square degrees of thesky, probing a total cosmic volume of ~5.5 h^{-3} gpc^3. we find that the newlrg sample at z~0.7 shows very little positive evidence for the isw effect.indeed, the cross-correlation is negative out to ~1 deg. the standard lcdmmodel is rejected at ~2-3% significance by the new lrg data. we then performeda new test on the robustness of the lrg isw detections at z~0.35 and 0.55. wemade 8 rotations through 360deg of the cmb maps with respect to the lrg samplesaround the galactic pole. we find that in both cases there are stronger effectsat angles other than zero. this implies that the z~0.35 and 0.55 isw detectionsmay still be subject to systematic errors which combined with the knownsizeable statistical errors may leave these isw detections looking unreliable.we have further made the rotation test on several other samples where iswdetections have been claimed and find that they also show peaks when rotated.we conclude that in the samples we have tested the isw effect may be absent andwe argue that this result may not be in contradiction with previous results.

0912.0511	angular correlation function of 1.5 million lrgs: clustering evolution  and a search for bao	we present the angular correlation function measured from photometric samplescomprising 1,562,800 luminous red galaxies (lrgs). three lrg samples wereextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data, based oncolour-cut selections at redshifts, z ~ 0.35, 0.55 and 0.7 as calibrated by thespectroscopic surveys, sdss-lrg, 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq), and the aaomegalrg survey. the galaxy samples cover ~7600 s.q.deg of the sky, probing a totalcosmic volume of ~5.5 h^-3} gpc^3.  the small and intermediate scale correlation functions generally showsignificant deviations from a single power-law fit with a well-detected breakat ~1 h^-1 mpc, consistent with the transition scale between the 1- and 2-haloterms in halo occupation models. for galaxy separations 1-20 h^-1 mpc and atfixed luminosity, we see virtually no evolution of the clustering with redshiftand the data is consistent with a simple high peaks biasing model where thecomoving lrg space density is constant with z. at fixed z, the lrg clusteringamplitude increases with luminosity in accordance with the simple high peaksmodel, with a typical lrg dark matter halo mass 10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_sol. for r &lt;1 h^-1 mpc, the evolution is slightly faster and the clustering decreasestowards high redshift consistent with a virialised clustering model. however,assuming the hod and lcdm halo merger frameworks, ~2-3 per cent per gyr of thelrgs is required to merge in order to explain the small scales clusteringevolution, consistent with previous results [abridge].

0709.0786	low accretion rates at the agn cosmic downsizing epoch	context: x-ray surveys of active galactic nuclei (agn) indicate `cosmicdownsizing', with the comoving number density of high-luminosity objectspeaking at higher redshifts (z about 2) than low-luminosity agn (z&lt;1). aims: wetest whether downsizing is caused by activity shifting towards low-mass blackholes accreting at near-eddington rates, or by a change in the average rate ofaccretion onto supermassive black holes. we estimate the black hole masses andeddington ratios of an x-ray selected sample of agn in the chandra deep fieldsouth at z&lt;1, probing the epoch where agn cosmic downsizing has been reported.methods: black hole masses are estimated both from host galaxy stellar masses,which are estimated from fitting to published optical and near-infraredphotometry, and from near-infrared luminosities, applying establishedcorrelations between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. both methodsgive consistent results. comparison and calibration of possibleredshift-dependent effects is also made using published faint host galaxyvelocity dispersion measurements. results: the eddington ratios in our samplespan the range 10^{-5} to 1, with median log(l_bol/l_edd)=-2.87, and withtypical black hole masses about 10^{8} solar masses. the broad distribution ofeddington ratios is consistent with that expected for agn samples at low andmoderate luminosity. we find no evidence that the cdf-s agn population isdominated by low-mass black holes accreting at near-eddington ratios and theresults suggest that diminishing accretion rates onto average-sized black holesare responsible for the reported agn downsizing at redshifts below unity.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1105.2547	do all qsos have the same black hole mass?	qsos from sdss, 2qz and 2slaq covering an order of magnitude in luminosity atfixed redshift exhibit similar amplitudes of clustering. in addition, qsoclustering evolution at z&gt;0.5 is well fitted by a model that assumes a fixedhost halo mass, implying that qsos may occur in a relatively narrow range ofhalo and bh mass. we argue that the slow evolution of early-type galaxies outto z~1-2 may also provide support for a slow evolution of qso host bh masses.the result would mean that if high-z qsos radiate at eddington rates then low-zsyi must radiate at ~100x less than eddington. we conclude that models whereqsos radiate at l_edd require m_bh and m_halo to be decoupled to circumvent theclustering results. while single bh mass and flickering models fit the z&gt;0.5clustering results, they appear to be rejected by the z~0, m_bh-l relation fromreverberation mapping. we find that the inclusion of z&lt;0.5 qso clustering dataimproves the fit of a long-lived qso model and suggest that the predictions ofa ple model for qso bh masses agree reasonably with uv-bump and reverberationestimates (abridged).

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1205.1401	composite reverberation mapping	reverberation mapping offers one of the best techniques for studying theinner regions of qsos. it is based on cross-correlating continuum andemission-line light curves. new time-resolved optical surveys will produce wellsampled light curves for many thousands of qsos. we explore the potential ofstacking samples to produce composite cross-correlations for groups of objectsthat have well sampled continuum light curves, but only a few (~2)emission-line measurements. this technique exploits current and futurewide-field optical monitoring surveys (e.g. pan-starrs, lsst) and themultiplexing capability of multi-object spectrographs (e.g. 2df, hectospec) tosignificantly reduce the observational expense of reverberation mapping, inparticular at high redshift (0.5 to 2.5).  we demonstrate the technique using simulated qso light curves and explore thebiases involved when stacking cross-correlations in some simplified situations.we show that stacked cross correlations have smaller amplitude peaks comparedto well sampled correlation functions as the mean flux of the emission lightcurve is poorly constrained. however, the position of the peak remains intact.we find there can be `kinks' in stacked correlation functions due to differentmeasurements contributing to different parts of the correlation function.  using the pan-starrs medium-deep survey (mds) as a template we show thatcross-correlation lags should be measurable in a sample size of 500 qsos thathave weekly photometric monitoring and two spectroscopic observations. finallywe apply the technique to a small sample (42) of qsos that have light curvesfrom the mds. we find no indication of a peak in the stacked cross-correlation.a larger spectroscopic sample is required to produce robust reverberation lags.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.1636	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the mass-metallicity relationship	context: the mass-metallicity relationship (mmr) of star-forming galaxies iswell-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to itsexact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. aims: we measurethe mmr in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we compare our measuredmmr to that measured in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and study thedependence of the mmr on various selection criteria to identify potentialcauses for disparities seen in the literature. methods: we use strong emissionline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. we then apply a range ofselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in theinferred mmr. results: the shape and position of the mmr can differsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.after selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we findthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in gama is inreasonable agreement with that found in the sdss despite the difference in theluminosity range probed. conclusions: in view of the significant variations ofthe mmr brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteriaand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the mmr fromdifferent surveys and studies directly. we also conclude that there could be amodest level of evolution over 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.35 within the gama sample.

0704.3739	luminous red galaxy clustering at z~0.7 - first results using aaomega	we report on the aat-aaomega lrg pilot observing run to establish thefeasibility of a large spectroscopic survey using the new aaomega instrument.we have selected luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using single epoch sdssriz-photometry to i&lt;20.5 and z&lt;20.2. we have observed in 3 fields including thecosmos field and the combo-17 s11 field, obtaining a sample of ~600 redshiftz&gt;=0.5 lrgs. exposure times varied from 1 - 4 hours to determine the minimumexposure for aaomega to make an essentially complete lrg redshift survey inaverage conditions. we show that lrg redshifts to i&lt;20.5 can measured inapproximately 1.5hr exposures and present comparisons with 2slaq and combo-17(photo-)redshifts. crucially, the riz selection coupled with the 3-4 timesimproved aaomega throughput is shown to extend the lrg mean redshift fromz=0.55 for 2slaq to z=0.681+/- 0.005 for riz-selected lrgs. this extended rangeis vital for maximising the s/n for the detection of the baryon acousticoscillations (baos). furthermore, we show that the amplitude of lrg clusteringis s_0 = 9.9+/-0.7 h^-1 mpc, as high as that seen in the 2slaq lrg survey.consistent results for the real-space amplitude are found from projected andsemi-projected correlation functions. this high clustering amplitude isconsistent with a long-lived population whose bias evolves as predicted by asimple ``high-peaks'' model. we conclude that a redshift survey of 360 000 lrgsover 3000deg^2, with an effective volume some 4 times bigger than previouslyused to detect bao with lrgs, is possible with aaomega in 170 nights.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1305.1803	stacked reverberation lags at high redshift	over the past 20years reverberation mapping has proved one of the mostsuccessful techniques for studying the local (&lt;1pc) environment ofsuper-massive black holes that drive active galactic nuclei. key successes ofreverberation mapping have been direct black hole mass estimates, theradius-luminosity relation for the hbeta line and the calibration ofsingle-epoch mass estimators commonly employed up to z~7. however, observingconstraints mean that few studies have been successful at z&gt;0.1, or for themore-luminous quasars that make up the majority of current spectroscopicsamples, or for the rest-frame ultra-violet emission lines available in opticalspectra of z&gt;0.5 objects.  previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtainreverberation mapping results at high z. here we present the first results froma campaign designed for this purpose. we construct stacked cross-correlationfunctions for the civ and mgii lines and find a clear peak in both. we find thepeak in the mgii correlation is at longer lags than civ consistent withprevious results at low redshift. for the civ sample we are able to bin byluminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.this civ radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies butwith a fraction of the observational cost.

0801.1816	qso-lrg 2-point cross-correlation function and redshift-space distorions	we have measured the bias of qsos as a function of qso luminosity at fixedredshift (z&lt;1) by cross-correlating them with lrgs in the same spatial volume,hence breaking the degeneracy between qso luminosity and redshift. we use threeqso samples from 2slaq, 2qz and sdss covering a qso absolute magnitude range,-24.5&lt;m_{b_j}&lt;-21.5, and cross-correlate them with 2slaq (z~0.5) and aaomega(z~0.7) photometric and spectroscopic lrgs in the same redshift ranges. the 2-dand 3-d cross-clustering measurements are generally in good agreement. our(2slaq) qso-lrg clustering amplitude (r_0=6.8_{-0.3}^{+0.1}h^{-1}mpc) asmeasured from the semi-projected cross-correlation function appears similar tothe (2slaq) lrg-lrg auto-correlation amplitude (r_0=7.45\pm0.35h^{-1}mpc) andboth are higher than the (2qz+2slaq) qso-qso amplitude (r_0\simeq5.0h^{-1}mpc).our measurements show remarkably little qso-lrg cross-clustering dependence onqso luminosity. if anything, the results imply that brighter qsos may be lesshighly biased than faint qsos, the opposite direction expected from simple highpeaks biasing models. assuming a standard lcdm model and values for b_{lrg}measured from lrg autocorrelation analyses, we find b_q=1.45\pm0.11 atm_{b_j}\approx-24 and b_q=1.90\pm0.16 at m_{b_j}~-22. we also find consistentresults for the qso bias from a z-space distortion analysis of the qso-lrgcross-clustering at z~0.55. the dynamical infall results give \beta_q=0.55\pm0.10, implying b_q=1.4\pm0.2. thus both the z-space distortion andthe amplitude analyses yield b_q~1.5 at m_{b_j}~-23. the implied dm halo massinhabited by qsos at z~0.55 is \sim10^{13}h^{-1}m_{\sun}, again approximatelyindependent of qso luminosity.

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

1410.3931	the sami galaxy survey: towards a unified dynamical scaling relation for  galaxies of all types	we take advantage of the first data from the sydney-aao multi-object integralfield (sami) galaxy survey to investigate the relation between the kinematicsof gas and stars, and stellar mass in a comprehensive sample of nearbygalaxies. we find that all 235 objects in our sample, regardless of theirmorphology, lie on a tight relation linking stellar mass ($m_{*}$) to internalvelocity quantified by the $s_{0.5}$ parameter, which combines the contributionof both dispersion ($\sigma$) and rotational velocity ($v_{rot}$) to thedynamical support of a galaxy ($s_{0.5}=\sqrt{0.5v_{rot}^{2}+\sigma^{2}}$). ourresults are independent of the baryonic component from which $\sigma$ and$v_{rot}$ are estimated, as the $s_{0.5}$ of stars and gas agree remarkablywell. this represents a significant improvement compared to the canonical$m_{*}$ vs. $v_{rot}$ and $m_{*}$ vs. $\sigma$ relations. not only is no samplepruning necessary, but also stellar and gas kinematics can be usedsimultaneously, as the effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once$v_{rot}$ and $\sigma$ are combined. our findings illustrate how thecombination of dispersion and rotational velocities for both gas and stars canprovide us with a single dynamical scaling relation valid for galaxies of allmorphologies across at least the stellar mass range8.5$&lt;log(m_{*}/m_{\odot})&lt;$11. such relation appears to be more general and atleast as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a uniquetool for investigating the link between galaxy kinematics and baryonic content,and a less biased comparison with theoretical models.

1503.01265	discovery of hi gas in a young radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$ using the  australian square kilometre array pathfinder	we report the discovery of a new 21-cm hi absorption system usingcommissioning data from the boolardy engineering test array of the australiansquare kilometre array pathfinder (askap). using the 711.5 - 1015.5 mhz band ofaskap we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuousredshift range between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which has, until now, remainedlargely unexplored. the absorption line is detected at $z = 0.44$ towards theghz-peaked spectrum radio source pks b1740$-$517 and demonstrates askap'sexcellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for hiabsorption at these redshifts. optical spectroscopy and imaging using thegemini-south telescope indicates that the hi gas is intrinsic to the hostgalaxy of the radio source. the narrow oiii emission lines show cleardouble-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation ofthe ionized gas. archival data from the \emph{xmm-newton} satellite exhibit anabsorbed x-ray spectrum that is consistent with a high column density obscuringmedium around the active galactic nucleus. the hi absorption profile iscomplex, with four distinct components ranging in width from 5 to 300 kms$^{-1}$ and fractional depths from 0.2 to 20 per cent. in addition to systemichi gas, in a circumnuclear disc or ring structure aligned with the radio jet,we find evidence for a possible broad outflow of neutral gas moving at a radialvelocity of $v \sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$. we infer that the expanding young radiosource ($t_{\rm age} \approx 2500$ yr) is cocooned within a dense medium andmay be driving circumnuclear neutral gas in an outflow of $\sim$ 1$\mathrm{m}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0202386	the 2df bl lac survey	we have optically identified a sample of 56 featureless continuum objectswithout significant proper motion from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz). thesteep number--magnitude relation of the sample, $n(\bj) \propto 10^{0.7\bj}$,is similar to that derived for qsos in the 2qz and inconsistent with anypopulation of galactic objects. follow up high resolution, highsignal-to-noise, spectroscopy of five randomly selected objects confirms thefeatureless nature of these sources. assuming the objects in the sample to belargely featureless agn, and using the qso evolution model derived for the 2qz,we predict the median redshift of the sample to be $z=1.1$. this model alsoreproduces the observed number-magnitude relation of the sample using arenormalisation of the qso luminosity function, $\phi^* = \phi^*_{\rm \scqso}/66 \simeq 1.65 \times 10^{-8} $mag$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$. only $\sim$20 percent of the objects have a radio flux density of $s_{1.4}&gt;3 $mjy, and furthervla observations at 8.4 ghz place a $5\sigma$ limit of $s_{8.4} &lt; 0.2$mjy onthe bulk of the sample. we postulate that these objects could form a populationof radio-weak agn with weak or absent emission lines, whose optical spectra areindistinguishable from those of bl lac objects.

astro-ph;0205039	clustering in the 2df qso redshift survey	we present clustering results from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) whichcurrently contains over 20,000 qsos at z&lt;3. the two-point correlation functionof qsos averaged over the entire survey (&lt;z&gt;~1.5) is found to be similar tothat of local galaxies. when sub-dividing the sample as a function of redshift,we find that for an einstein-de sitter universe qso clustering is constant (incomoving coordinates) over the entire redshift range probed by the 2qz, whilein a universe with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 there is a marginal increase inclustering with redshift. sub-dividing the 2qz on the basis of apparentmagnitude we find only a slight difference between the clustering of qsos ofdifferent apparent brightness, with the brightest qsos having marginallystronger clustering. we have made a first measurement of the redshift spacedistortion of qso clustering, with the goal of determining the value ofcosmological parameters (in partcular lambda_0) from geometric distortions. thecurrent data do not allow us to discriminate between models, however, incombination with constraints from the evolution of mass clustering we findomega_0=1-lambda_0=0.23 +0.44-0.13 and beta(z~1.4)=0.39 +0.18-0.17. the full2qz data set will provide further cosmological constraints.

astro-ph;0207571	the correlation of line strength with luminosity and redshift from  composite qso spectra	we have generated a series of composite qso spectra using over 22000individual low resolution (~8a) qso spectra obtained from the 2df(18.25&lt;bj&lt;20.85) and 6df (16&lt;bj&lt;18.25) qso redshift surveys. the large size ofthe catalogue has enabled us to construct composite spectra in narrow redshift(dz=0.25) and absolute magnitude (dmb=0.5) bins. the median number of qsos ineach composite is ~200, yielding typical s/n of ~100. for a given redshiftinterval, the composite spectra cover a factor of over 25 in luminosity. usingthe composite spectra we have measured the equivalent widths (ews) of the majorbroad and narrow emission lines, and the caii k absorption feature due to thehost galaxy of the agn. assuming a fixed host galaxy spectral energydistribution (sed), the correlation between caii k ew and luminosity implieslgal proportional to lqso**{0.42+-0.05}. we find strong anti-correlations withluminosity for the ews of [oii] and [nev]. these provide hints to the generalfading of the nlr in high luminosity sources which we attribute to the nlrdimensions becoming larger than the host galaxy. if average agn host galaxieshave seds similar to average galaxies, then the observed narrow [oii] emissioncould be solely due to the host galaxy at low luminosities (m_b~-20). wemeasure highly significant baldwin effects for most broad emission lines (civ,ciii], mgii, hbeta, hgamma) and show that they are predominantly due tocorrelations with luminosity, not redshift. we find that the hbeta and hgammabalmer lines show an inverse baldwin effect and are positively correlated withluminosity, unlike the broad uv lines. we postulate that this previouslyunknown effect is due to a luminosity dependent change in the the ratio of diskto non-disk continuum components (abridged).

astro-ph;0211624	the 2df qso redshift survey - x. lensing of background qsos by galaxy  groups	we cross-correlate qsos from the 2df survey with galaxy groups. the galaxysamples are limited to b &lt; 20.5. we use an objective algorithm to detect galaxygroups. a 3sigma anti-correlation is observed between qsos and galaxy groups.this paucity of faint qsos around groups is neither a selection effect nor dueto restrictions on the placement of 2df fibres. by observing the colours ofqsos on the scales of the anti-correlation, we limit dust in galaxy groups,finding a maximum reddening of e(b_j-r) &lt; 0.012 at the 95% level. the smallamount of dust thus inferred is insufficient to cause the anti-correlation,supporting the suggestion by croom &amp; shanks that the signal is due togravitational lensing. the possibility remains that tailored dust models, suchas grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, couldexplain the anti-correlation. assuming the signal is caused by lensing ratherthan dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a singular isothermalsphere that would cause the anti-correlation as around 1150 km/s. simulationsreject 600 km/s at the 5% significance level. we also model foreground lensesas nfw haloes and measure the typical mass within 1.5 mpc/h of the halo centreas m_{1.5} = (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^{15} solarmasses/h. regardless of whether weutilise a sis or nfw dark matter profile, our model favours more mass in groupsthan accounted for in a universe with density parameter omega_m = 0.3. detailedsimulations and galaxy group redshifts will significantly reduce the currentsystematic uncertainties in these $\omega_m$ estimates. reducing the remaininguncertainty will require larger qso and galaxy group surveys (abridged).

astro-ph;0302280	the 2df qso redshift survey - xi. the qso power spectrum	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df qso redshift surveycatalogue containing 22652 qsos. utilising the huge volume probed by the qsos,we can accurately measure power out to scales of ~500mpc and derive newconstraints, at z~1.4, on the matter and baryonic contents of the universe.importantly, these new cosmological constraints are derived at an intermediateepoch between the cmb observations at z~1000, and local (z~0) studies oflarge-scale structure; the average qso redshift corresponds to a look-back timeof approximately two-thirds of the age of the universe. we find that theamplitude of clustering of the qsos at z~1.4 is similar to that of present daygalaxies. the power spectra of the qsos at high and low redshift are comparedand we find little evidence for any evolution in the amplitude. assuming alambda cosmology to derive the comoving distances, r(z), to the qsos, the powerspectrum derived can be well described by a model with shape parametergamma=0.13+-0.02. if an einstein-de sitter model r(z) is instead assumed, aslightly higher value of gamma=0.16+-0.03 is obtained. a comparison with thehubble volume lcdm simulation shows very good agreement over the whole range ofscales considered. a standard (omega_m=1) cdm model, however, predicts a muchhigher value of gamma than is observed, and it is difficult to reconcile such amodel with these data. we fit cdm model power spectra (assuming scale-invariantinitial fluctuations), convolved with the survey window function, and correctedfor redshift space distortions, and find that models with baryon oscillationsare slightly preferred, with the baryon fraction omega_b/omega_m=0.18+-0.10.the overall shape of the power spectrum provides a strong constraint onomega_m*h (where h is the hubble parameter), with omega_m*h=0.19+-0.05.

astro-ph;0304290	ghosts of the milky way: a search for topology in new quasar catalogues	we revisit the possibility that we inhabit a compact multi-connected flat, ornearly-flat, universe. analysis of cobe data has shown that, for such a case,the size of the fundamental domain must be a substantial fraction of thehorizon size. nevertheless, there could be several copies of the universewithin the horizon. if the milky way was once a quasar we might detect its`ghost' images. using new large quasar catalogues we repeat the search byfagundes &amp; wichoski for antipodal quasar pairs. by applying linear theory toaccount for the peculiar velocity of the local group, we are able to narrow thesearch radius to 134 arcsec. we find seven candidate antipodal quasar pairswithin this search radius. however, a similar number would be expected bychance. we argue that, even with larger quasar catalogues, and more accuratevalues of the cosmological parameters, it is unlikely to be possible toidentify putative ghost pairs unambiguously, because of the uncertainty of thecorrection for peculiar motion of the milky way.

astro-ph;0304541	emission line widths and qso black hole mass estimates from the 2df qso  redshift survey	we have used composite spectra generated from more than 22000 qsos observedin the course of the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys to investigate therelationship between the velocity width of emission lines and qso luminosity.we find that the velocity width of the broad emission lines hbeta, hgamma,mgii, ciii] and civ are correlated with the continuum luminosity, with asignificance of more than 99 per cent. of the major narrow emission lines([oiii] 5007, [oii] 3727, neiii 3870 and nev 3426) only [oiii] exhibits asignificant correlation between line width and luminosity. assuming that thegas is moving in keplerian orbits and that the radius of the broad line regionis related to the qso continuum luminosity, we use the velocity widths of thebroad lines to derive average black hole masses for the qsos contributing tothe composite spectra. the resultant qso mass-luminosity relationship isconsistent with m ~ l^0.97+-0.16. we find that the correlation between linewidth and redshift, if present, must be weak, and only civ shows significantevidence of evolution. this enables us to constrain the redshift evolution ofthe black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~&lt; 1, muchless than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in qso luminosity evolution. assumingthat the motion of the broad line region gas is keplerian and that its radiusdepends on the qso luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weakredshift dependence is too small for the observed qso luminosity function to bedue to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.

astro-ph;0403040	the 2df qso redshift survey - xii. the spectroscopic catalogue and  luminosity function	we present the final catalogue of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz), based onanglo-australian telescope 2df spectroscopic observations of 44576colour-selected (u b_j r) objects with 18.25&lt;b_j&lt;20.85 selected from apm scansof uk schmidt telescope (ukst) photographic plates. the 2qz comprises 23338qsos, 12292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compactnarrow-emission-line galaxies. we obtained a reliable spectroscopicidentification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2df. we also report onthe 6df qso redshift survey (6qz), based on ukst 6df observations of 1564brighter 16&lt;b_j&lt;18.25 sources selected from the same photographic inputcatalogue. in total, we identified 322 qsos spectroscopically in the 6qz. thecompleted 2qz is, by more than a factor 50, the largest homogeneous qsocatalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (b_j&lt;20.85) and high qsosurface densities (35 qsos deg^-2). as such it represents an important resourcein the study of the universe at moderate-to-high redshifts. as an example ofthe results possible with the 2qz, we also present our most recent analysis ofthe optical qso luminosity function and its cosmological evolution withredshift. for a flat, omega_m=0.3 and omega_lam=0.7, universe, we find that adouble power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-backtime, t, of the form l*(z) exp(6.15t), equivalent to an e-folding time of 2gyr,provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the qso luminosityfunction over the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.1 and m_bj&lt;-22.5. evolution described by aquadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with l*(z)~10^(1.39z-0.29z^2).

astro-ph;0403065	200 mpc sized structure in the 2df qso redshift survey	the completed 2df qso redshift (2qz) survey has been used to search forextreme large-scale cosmological structure (around 200 mpc) over the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;2.5. we demonstrate that statistically significant overdensities andunderdensities do exist and hence represent the detection of cosmologicalfluctuations on comoving scales that correspond to those presently detected inthe cosmic microwave background. however, the fractional overdensities onscales &gt;100mpc are in the linear or only weakly non-linear regime and do notrepresent collapsed non-linear structures. we compare the measurements with theexpectation of a standard lcdm model by measuring the variance of counts incells and find that, provided the distribution of qsos on large scales exhibitsa mild bias with respect to the distribution of dark matter, the observedfluctuations are found to be in good agreement with the model. there is noevidence on such scales for any extreme structures that might require, forexample, departures from the assumption of gaussian initial perturbations. thusthe power-spectrum derived from the 2qz survey appears to provide a completedescription of the distribution of qsos. the amount of bias and its redshiftdependence that is required is consistent with that found from studying theclustering of 2qz qsos on 10 mpc scales, and may be adequately described by anapproximately redshift-invariant power spectrum with normalisation sigma_8=1.0corresponding to a bias at z=0 of b=1.1 rising to b=2 at the survey's meanredshift z=1.5.

astro-ph;0501422	the first detection of [oiii] emission from high-redshift damped  lyman-alpha galaxies	we present the detection of [oiii] emission lines from the galaxiesresponsible for two high-redshift z&gt;1.75 damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorptionlines. these are the first detections of rest-frame optical emission lines fromhigh-redshift dla galaxies. unlike the lyman-alpha line, the [oiii] lineprovides a measure of the systemic velocity of the galaxy. we compare the[oiii] redshifts with the velocity profile of the low-ionisation metal lines inthese two absorbers, with the goal of distinguishing between the model ofprochaska and wolfe of dla absorbers as large rapidly rotating cold thickdiscs, and the standard hierarchical cdm model of structure formation, in whichdlas arise in protogalactic fragments. we find some discrepancies with thepredictions of the former model. furthermore the image of the dla galaxytowards q2206-1958 shows a complex disturbed morphology, which is more inaccord with the hierarchical picture. we use the properties of the rest-frameoptical emission lines to further explore the question posed by moller et al.:are high-redshift dla galaxies lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected by gascross section? the measured velocity dispersions of the dla galaxies are inagreement with this picture, while the data on the [oiii] luminosities and thevelocity differences between the lyman-alpha and [oiii] lines are inconclusive,as there are insufficient lbg measurements overlapping in luminosity. finallywe estimate the star formation rates in these two dla galaxies, using a varietyof diagnostics, and include a discussion of the extent to which the [oiii] lineis useful for this purpose.

astro-ph;0502481	on statistical lensing and the anti-correlation between 2df qsos and  foreground galaxies	we cross-correlate apm and sdss galaxies with background qsos from the 2dfqso redshift survey, and detect a significant (2.8sigma) anti-correlation. thelack of a signal between 2df stars and our galaxy samples suggests theanti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. the possibility that dust inthe foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginallyrejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of qso colours. it ispossible that dust that obscures qsos without reddening them, or preferentiallydiscards reddened qsos from the 2qz sample, could produce such ananti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive qso-galaxycorrelations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. our detection of agalaxy-qso anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. whencombined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-qsocorrelation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint andbright qso samples showing positive or negative correlations according to theqso n(m) slope. we find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.we consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matterand find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on0.1mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for lcdm). whilst the slope of our power-law fit tothe qso-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compareour measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determineb~1 on mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, isscale-dependent. these results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/hscales probed, than predicted by simple lcdm biasing prescriptions, and canthus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.

astro-ph;0504300	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the z&lt;2.1 quasar luminosity function  from 5645 quasars to g=21.85	we have used the 2df instrument on the aat to obtain redshifts of a sample ofz&lt;3, 18.0&lt;g&lt;21.85 quasars selected from sdss imaging. these data are part of alarger joint programme: the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey (2slaq). we describethe quasar selection algorithm and present the resulting luminosity function of5645 quasars in 105.7 deg^2. the bright end number counts and luminosityfunction agree well with determinations from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz)data to g\sim20.2. however, at the faint end the 2slaq number counts andluminosity function are steeper than the final 2qz results from croom et al.(2004), but are consistent with the preliminary 2qz results from boyle et al.(2000). using the functional form adopted for the 2qz analysis, we find a faintend slope of beta=-1.78+/-0.03 if we allow all of the parameters to vary andbeta=-1.45+/-0.03 if we allow only the faint end slope and normalization tovary. our maximum likelihood fit to the data yields 32% more quasars than thefinal 2qz parameterization, but is not inconsistent with other g&gt;21 deepsurveys. the 2slaq data exhibit no well defined ``break'' but do clearlyflatten with increasing magnitude. the shape of the quasar luminosity functionderived from 2slaq is in good agreement with that derived from type i quasarsfound in hard x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0504438	the 2df qso redshift survey - xv. correlation analysis of redshift-space  distortions	we analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of qso clustering in the2df qso redshift survey (2qz). to interpret the z-space correlation function,xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the qso real-space correlationfunction, xi(r). although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projectedcorrelation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat tooshallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),at larger scales &gt; 20 h^(-1) mpc. motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and in standard lcdm predictions, we use adouble power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).the model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1&lt;r&lt;10 h^(-1) mpc andgamma=2.30 for 10&lt;r&lt;40 h^(-1) mpc. as found for 2dfgrs, the value of betadetermined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form ofxi(r) assumed. with our double power-law form for xi(r), we measurebeta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). assuming the same model for xi(r) we thenanalyse the z-space distortions in the 2qz xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints onthe values of omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the methodof hoyle et al. the constraints we derive are omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results atthe ~1 sigma level.

astro-ph;0607629	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the luminosity function of  luminous red galaxies to z=0.6	we present new measurements of the luminosity function (lf) of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) survey. we have carefully quantified, and corrected for,uncertainties in the k and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colourselection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we arestudying the same galaxy population in both surveys. using a limited subset of6326 sdss lrgs (with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.24) and 1725 2slaq lrgs (with 0.5 &lt;z&lt;0.6), forwhich the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence forany additional evolution in the lrg lf, over this redshift range, beyond thatexpected from a simple passive evolution model. this lack of additionalevolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of sdss and 2slaqlrgs, brighter than m_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 l_sunmpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 l_sun mpc^-3 respectively (&lt;10% uncertainty). wecompare our lfs to the combo-17 data and find excellent agreement over the sameredshift range. together, these surveys show no evidence for additionalevolution (beyond passive) in the lf of lrgs brighter than m_r - 5logh = -21(or brighter than l*). we test our sdss and 2slaq lfs against a simple ``drymerger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at leasthalf of the lrgs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more thanhalf their stellar mass) by z=0.6. this limit is barely consistent with recentresults from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0609270	the evolution of host mass and black hole mass in qsos from the 2df qso  redshift survey	we investigate the relation between the mass of super-massive black holes(mbh) in qsos and the mass of the dark matter halos hosting them (mdh). wemeasure the widths of broad emission lines (mgii lambda 2798, civ lambda 1549)from qso composite spectra as a function of redshift. these widths are thenused to determine virial black hole mass estimates.  we compare our virial black hole mass estimates to dark matter halo massesfor qso hosts derived by croom et al.

astro-ph;0612401	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: qso clustering and the l-z degeneracy	we combine the qso samples from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) and the2df-sdss lrg and qso survey (2slaq) in order to investigate the clustering ofz~1.4 qsos and measure the correlation function. the clustering signal inz-space, projected along the sky direction, is similar to that previouslyobtained from 2qz alone. by fitting the z-space correlation function andlifting the degeneracy between beta and omega_m_0 by using linear theorypredictions, we obtain beta(z=1.4) = 0.60+-0.12 and omega_m_0=0.25+-0.08,implying a value for the qso bias, b(z=1.4)=1.5+-0.2. we further find that qsoclustering does not depend strongly on luminosity at fixed redshift. thisresult is inconsistent with the expectation of simple `high peaks' biasingmodels where more luminous, rare qsos are assumed to inhabit higher masshaloes. the data are more consistent with models which predict that qsos ofdifferent luminosities reside in haloes of similar mass. we find that halo massdoes not evolve strongly with redshift nor depend on qso luminosity. we finallyinvestigate how black hole mass correlates with luminosity and redshift andascertain the relation between eddington efficiency and black hole mass. ourresults suggest that qsos of different luminosities may contain black holes ofsimilar mass.

astro-ph;9810170	radio-quiet qso environments - i. the correlation of qsos and bj&lt;23  galaxies	in this paper we present results of an analysis of radio-quiet qsoenvironments. the aim is to determine the relation between qsos and galaxies asa function of redshift. we cross-correlate a sample of ~150 qsos from opticallyand x-ray selected catalogues with faint, bj&lt;23, galaxies. these data allow usto probe the galaxy clustering environment of qsos out to z~1.0-1.5. far fromgiving a positive correlation, at z&lt;1.5 the qso-galaxy cross-correlationfunction is marginally negative, with w(theta&lt;120'')=-0.027+-0.020. colourinformation suggests that the anti-correlation is most significant between theqsos and the red galaxy population.  we have constructed models to predict the qso-galaxy cross-correlation, usingthe known form of the galaxy n(z) at bj&lt;23, and assuming a variety ofclustering evolution rates. cases in which qsos exist in rich clusterenvironments are comfortably ruled out at more than 5sigma and the results aremore consistent with a `normal' galaxy environment for radio-quiet qsos. if thesmall anti-correlation is interpreted as an effect of gravitational lensing,this conclusion is not altered. in this case, the data are only ~1sigma belowthe low clustering amplitude models, while the high amplitude models are stillcomfortably rejected. we therefore conclude that these qsos may not be muchmore highly biased than optically selected galaxies.

astro-ph;9905249	statistical lensing of faint qsos by galaxy clusters	we investigate the anti-correlation between faint high redshift qsos and lowredshift galaxy groups found by boyle, fong &amp; shanks (1988), on the assumptionthat it is caused by gravitational lensing of a flat qso number count, ratherthan any other systematic effect (e.g dust). an isothermal sphere lens model,requires a velocity dispersion of 1286+72-91 km/s. addition of a constantdensity plane reduces this to 1143+109-153 km/s, while the plane density is0.081+-0.032h g/cm**2. both these values are considerably larger than the400-600km/s expected for poor clusters and groups and imply that the massassociated with such groups is ~4 times larger than inferred from virialanalyses. if due to lensing, this measurement clearly tends to favour highvalues of omega_0. we demonstrate how an estimate of omega_0 may be obtained,finding omega_0=1.3(n/3x10^-4h^3mpc^-3)(r/1mpc)(sigma/1286km/s)^2. systematicuncertainties in r, the extent of the anti-correlation, and n, the group spacedensity, currently dominate this determination, but this will be a route toestimating omega_0 in improved galaxy-qso datasets where systematics can bebetter controlled. we compared our result to that of williams &amp; irwin (1998)who find a positive correlation between bright lbqs qsos and apm galaxies.adapting the analysis of williams &amp; irwin to our use of galaxy groups, we findagreement between the amplitude of the positive cross-correlation found forbright qsos and the negative cross-correlation found for faint qsos. thisanalysis leads to a common estimate of omega_0*sigma_8~3-4. this, however, issignificantly higher than indicated from several other analyses. further testsof the accuracy of galaxy-qso cross-correlations and their implications foromega_0 and sigma_8 will soon be available from the new 2df qso catalogue.
