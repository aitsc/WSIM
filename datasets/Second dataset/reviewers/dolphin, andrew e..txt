0902.3460	the detection of inside-out disk growth in m33	we present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis ofthe m33 disk from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard thehubble space telescope. the photometry provides a detailed census of the redclump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermostfield. through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find thatthe percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9%in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. the disk shows aclear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc10 gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 gyr ago, in agreementwith analytical predictions for disk growth. beyond the disk truncation radius,however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradientreverses, in agreement with recent simulations. the late and slow growth of thestellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of m33.

0706.4377	discovery of the pre-main sequence population of the stellar association  lh 95 in the large magellanic cloud with hubble space telescope acs  observations	we report the discovery of an extraordinary number of pre-main sequence (pms)stars in the vicinity of the stellar association lh 95 in the large magellaniccloud (lmc). using the {\em advanced camera for surveys} on-board the {\emhubble} space telescope in wide-field mode we obtained deep high-resolutionimaging of the main body of the association and of a nearby representative lmcbackground field. these observations allowed us to construct thecolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) of the association in unprecedented detail, andto decontaminate the cmd for the average lmc stellar population. the mostsignificant result is the direct detection of a substantial population of pmsstars and their clustering properties with respect to the distribution of thehigher mass members of the association. although lh 95 represents a rathermodest star forming region, our photometry, with a detection limit $v$ \lsim 28mag, reveals in its vicinity more than 2,500 pms stars with masses down to$\sim 0.3$ m{\solar}. our observations offer, thus, a new perspective of atypical lmc association: the stellar content of lh 95 is found to extend frombright ob stars to faint red pms stars, suggesting a fully populated initialmass function (imf) from the massive blue giants down to the sub-solar massregime.

0906.3557	a revised characterization of the wfpc2 cte loss	charge-transfer loss on the wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) onboard thehubble space telescope is a primary source of uncertainty in stellar photometryobtained with this camera. this effect, discovered shortly after the camera wasinstalled, has grown over time and can dim stars by several tenths of amagnitude (or even more, in particularly bad cases). the impact of cte loss onwfpc2 stellar photometry was characterized by several studies between 1998 and2000, but has received diminished attention since acs became hst's primaryimager. after the failure of acs in january 2007, wfpc2 once again became theprimary imaging instrument onboard hst, restoring the importance of ensuringaccurate cte corrections.  this paper re-examines the cte loss of wfpc2, with three significant changesover previous studies. first, the present study considers calibration dataobtained through 2007, thus increasing the confidence in the reliability of thecte corrections when applied to recent observations. second, the change in cteloss during readout is accounted for analytically. finally, a reanalysis of thecte dependencies on counts, background, and observation date was made. theresulting correction is significantly more accurate than that provided in thewfpc2 instrument handbook (dolphin 2002 and updates through 2004), resulting inphotometry that can be enhanced by over 5% in certain circumstances.

0909.3025	does stellar feedback create hi holes? an hst/vla study of holmberg ii	we use deep hst/acs f555w and f814w photometry of resolved stars in the m81group dwarf irregular galaxy ho ii to study the hypothesis that the holesidentified in the neutral ism (hi) are created by stellar feedback. from thedeep photometry, we construct color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) and measure thestar formation histories (sfhs) for stars contained in hi holes from twoindependent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similarsized regions that span a range of hi column densities. converting the recentsfhs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has beengenerated to have created all holes. however, the required energy is not alwaysproduced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of thehole. the combination of the cmds, recent sfhs, and locations of young starsshows that the stellar populations inside hi holes are not coherent,single-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-agepopulations distributed across each hole. from a comparison of the modeled andobserved integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of starsinside of hi holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism forcreating the observed hi holes in ho ii is stellar feedback from multiplegenerations of sf spread out over tens or hundreds of myr, and thus, theconcept of an age for an hi hole is intrinsically ambiguous. we further findthat \halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation,do not correlate well with the positions of the hi holes. however, uv emission,which traces star formation over roughly the last 100 myr, shows a much bettercorrelation with the locations of the hi holes.

(2005), owing to the use of afactor of several more calibration stars which span a greater range of color.we find that the inferred transformations from each cluster individually do notvary significantly from the average, except for a small offset of thephotometric zeropoint in the f850lp filter. our results suggest that thepublished prescriptions for the time-dependent correction of ccdcharge-transfer efficiency appear to work very well over the ~3.5 yr intervalthat spans our observations of pal4 and pal14 and the archived images ofngc2419.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1210.6353	supernova remnant progenitor masses in m31	using hst photometry, we age-date 59 supernova remnants (snrs) in the spiralgalaxy m31 and use these ages to estimate zero-age main sequence masses (mzams)for their progenitors. to accomplish this, we create color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) and use cmd fitting to measure the recent star formation history (sfh)of the regions surrounding cataloged snr sites. we identify any young coevalpopulation that likely produced the progenitor star and assign an age anduncertainty to that population. application of stellar evolution models allowsus to infer the mzams from this age. because our technique is not contingent onprecise location of the progenitor star, it can be applied to the location ofany known snr. we identify significant young sf around 53 of the 59 snrs andassign progenitor masses to these, representing a factor of 2 increase overcurrently measured progenitor masses. we consider the remaining 6 snrs aseither probable type ia candidates or the result of core-collapse progenitorsthat have escaped their birth sites. the distribution of recovered progenitormasses is bottom heavy, showing a paucity of the most massive stars. if weassume a single power law distribution, dn/dm proportional to m^alpha, we finda distribution that is steeper than a salpeter imf (alpha=-2.35). inparticular, we find values of alpha outside the range -2.7 to -4.4 inconsistentwith our measured distribution at 95% confidence. if instead we assume adistribution that follows a salpeter imf up to some maximum mass, we find thatvalues of m_max greater than 26 msun are inconsistent with the measureddistribution at 95% confidence. in either scenario, the data suggest that somefraction of massive stars may not explode. the result is preliminary andrequires more snrs and further analysis. in addition, we use our distributionto estimate a minimum mass for core collapse between 7.0 and 7.8 msun.

1211.6105	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iv. a probabilistic approach  to inferring the high mass stellar initial mass function and other power-law  functions	we present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of thepresent day power-law stellar mass function (mf) of a resolved young starcluster. this technique (a) fully exploits the information content of a givendataset; (b) accounts for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way;(c) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (d) avoids thepitfalls associated with binning data; and (e) is applicable to virtually anyresolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of thehigh mass stellar mf (m &gt; 1 msun). using simulated clusters and markov chainmonte carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show thatestimates of the mf slope, {\alpha}, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,{\delta}{\alpha}, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and stellarmass range they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses andthe completeness are well-characterized. using idealized mock data, we computethe lower limit precision on {\alpha} and provide an analytic approximation for{\delta}{\alpha} as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range.we find that ~ 3/4 of quoted literature uncertainties are smaller than thetheoretical lower limit. by correcting these uncertainties to the theoreticallower limits, we find the literature studies yield &lt;{\alpha}&gt;=2.46 with a1-{\sigma} dispersion of 0.35 dex. we verify that it is impossible for apower-law mf to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of theimf. we show that avoiding substantial biases in the mf slope requires: (1)including the mf as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates;(2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses; and (3) fullycharacterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of agiven mass.

1301.7422	comparing the ancient star formation histories of the magellanic clouds	we present preliminary results from a new hst archival program aimed attightly constraining the ancient (&gt;4 gyr ago) star formation histories (sfhs)of the field populations of the smc and lmc. we demonstrate the quality of thearchival data by constructing hst/wfpc2-based color-magnitude diagrams (cmds;m_{f555w} ~ +8) for 7 spatially diverse fields in the smc and 8 fields in thelmc. the hst-based cmds are &gt;2 magnitudes deeper than any from ground basedobservations, and are particularly superior in high surface brightness regions,e.g., the lmc bar, which contain a significant fraction of star formation andare crowding limited from ground based observations. to minimize systematicuncertainties, we derive the sfh of each field using an identical maximumlikelihood cmd fitting technique. we then compute an approximate mass weightedaverage sfh for each galaxy. we find that both galaxies lack a dominant burstof early star formation, which suggests either a suppression or anunder-fueling of early star formation. from 10-12 gyr ago, the lmc experienceda period of enhanced stellar mass growth relative to the smc. similar to someprevious studies, we find two notable peaks in the sfh of the smc at ~4.5 and 9gyr ago, which could be due to repeated close passages with the lmc, implyingan interaction history that has persisted for at least 9 gyr. we find littleevidence for strong periodic behavior in the lifetime sfhs of both mcs,suggesting that repeated encounters with the milky way are unlikely. beginning~3.5 gyr ago, both galaxies show increases in their sfhs, in agreement withprevious studies, and thereafter, track each other remarkably well.

1305.7243	measuring galaxy star formation rates from integrated photometry:  insights from color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stars	we use empirical star formation histories (sfhs), measured from hst-basedresolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesiscodes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (seds) of ~50 nearbydwarf galaxies (6.5 &lt; log m/m_* &lt; 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). in thepresence of realistic sfhs, we compare the modeled and observed seds from theultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) and assess the reliability ofwidely used uv-based star formation rate (sfr) indicators. in the fuv through ibands, we find that the observed and modeled seds are in excellent agreement.in the spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled sedssystematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, dependingon treatment of the tp-agb stars in the synthesis models. we assess thereliability of uv luminosity as a sfr indicator, in light of independentlyconstrained sfhs. we find that fluctuations in the sfhs alone can cause factorof ~2 variations in the uv luminosities relative to the assumption of aconstant sfh over the past 100 myr. these variations are not stronglycorrelated with uv-optical colors, implying that correcting uv-based sfrs forthe effects of realistic sfhs is difficult using only the broadband sed.additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars olderthan 100 myr can contribute from &lt;5% to100% of the present day uv luminosity,highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formationtimescale associated with uv emission. we do find a relationship between uvemission timescale and broadband uv-optical color, though it is different thanpredictions based on exponentially declining sfh models. our findings havesignificant implications for the comparison of uv-based sfrs acrosslow-metallicity populations with diverse sfhs.

1306.2420	timescales on which star formation affects the neutral ism	turbulent neutral hydrogen (hi) line widths are often thought to be drivenprimarily by star formation (sf), but the timescale for converting sf energy tohi kinetic energy is unclear. as a complication, studies on the connectionbetween hi line widths and sf in external galaxies often use broadband tracersfor the sf rate, which must implicitly assume that sf histories (sfhs) havebeen constant over the timescale of the tracer. in this paper, we comparemeasures of hi energy to time-resolved sfhs in a number of nearby dwarfgalaxies. we find that hi energy surface density is strongly correlated onlywith sf that occurred 30-40 myr ago. this timescale corresponds to theapproximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 msun). thisanalysis suggests that the coupling between sf and the neutral ism is strongeston this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of thepeak energy from sf or to the coherent effects of many sne during thisinterval. at \sigma_sfr &gt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean couplingefficiency between sf energy and hi energy of \epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 usingthe 30-40 myr timescale. however, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower\sigma_sfr systems, implying that sf is not the primary driver of hi kinematicsat \sigma_sfr &lt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

1308.1740	on the estimation of random uncertainties of star formation histories	the standard technique for measurement of random uncertainties of starformation histories (sfhs) is the bootstrap monte carlo, in which thecolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) is repeatedly resampled. the variation in sfhsmeasured from the resampled cmds is assumed to represent the random uncertaintyin the sfh measured from the original data. however, this techniquesystematically and significantly underestimates the uncertainties for times inwhich the measured star formation rate is low or zero, leading to overly (andincorrectly) high confidence in that measurement. this study proposes analternative technique, the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc), which samples theprobability distribution of the parameters used in the original solution todirectly estimate confidence intervals. while the most commonly used mcmcalgorithms are incapable of adequately sampling a probability distribution thatcan involve thousands of highly correlated dimensions, the hybrid monte carloalgorithm is shown to be extremely effective and efficient for this particulartask. several implementation details, such as the handling of implicit priorscreated by parameterization of the sfh, are discussed in detail.

1308.4417	hst/wfc3 observations of low-mass globular clusters am 4 and palomar 13:  physical properties and implications for mass loss	we investigate the loss of low-mass stars in two of the faintest globularclusters known, am 4 and palomar 13 (pal 13), using hst/wfc3 f606w and f814wphotometry. to determine the physical properties of each cluster --- age, mass,metallicity, extinction, present day mass function (mf) --- we use the maximumlikelihood color-magnitude diagram (cmd) fitting program match and thedartmouth, padova and basti stellar evolution models. for am 4, the dartmouthmodels provide the best match to the cmd and yield an age of &gt;13 gyr,metallicity log z/z_solar = -1.68 +/- 0.08, a distance modulus (m-m)_v = 17.47+/- 0.03 and reddening a_v = 0.19 +/- 0.02. for pal 13 the dartmouth modelsgive an age of 13.4 +/- 0.5 gyr, log z/z_solar = -1.55 +/- 0.06, (m-m)_v =17.17 +/- 0.02 and a_v = 0.43 +/- 0.01. we find that the systematicuncertainties due to choice in assumed stellar model greatly exceed the randomuncertainties, highlighting the importance of using multiple stellar modelswhen analyzing stellar populations. assuming a single-sloped power law mf, wefind that am 4 and pal 13 have spectral indices alpha = +0.68 +/- 0.34 andalpha = -1.67 +/- 0.25 (where a salpeter mf has alpha = +1.35), respectively.comparing our derived slopes with literature measurements of cluster integratedmagnitude (m_v) and mf slope indicates that am 4 is an outlier. its mf slope issubstantially steeper than clusters of comparable luminosity, while pal 13 hasa mf in line with the general trend. we discuss both primordial and dynamicalorigins for the unusual mf slope of am 4 and tentatively favor the dynamicalscenario. however, mf slopes of more low luminosity clusters are needed toverify this hypothesis.

1312.2008	constraining the age of the ngc 4565 hi disk warp: determining the  origin of gas warps	we have mapped the distribution of young and old stars in the gaseous hi warpof ngc 4565. we find a clear correlation of young stars (&lt;600 myr) with thewarp, but no coincident old stars (&gt;1 gyr), which places an upper limit on theage of the structure. the formation rate of the young stars, which increased~300 myr ago relative to the surrounding regions, is (6.3 +2.5/-1.5) x 10^-5m_sol/yr/kpc^2. this implies a ~60+/-20 gyr depletion time of the hi warp,similar to the timescales calculated for the outer hi disks of nearby spiralgalaxies. while some stars associated with the warp fall into the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) region of the color magnitude diagram, where stars could beas old as 1 gyr, further investigation suggests that they may be interlopersrather than real agb stars. we discuss the implications of these ageconstraints for the formation of hi warps, and the gas fueling of diskgalaxies.

1402.3723	distance determinations to shield galaxies from hst imaging	the survey of hi in extremely low-mass dwarf galaxies (shield) is an on-goingmulti-wavelength program to characterize the gas, star formation, and evolutionin gas-rich, very low-mass galaxies. the galaxies were selected from the first~10% of the hi alfalfa survey based on their inferred low hi mass and lowbaryonic mass, and all systems have recent star formation. thus, the shieldsample probes the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function for star-forminggalaxies. here, we measure the distances to the 12 shield galaxies to bebetween 5-12 mpc by applying the tip of the red giant method to the resolvedstellar populations imaged by the hubble space telescope. based on thesedistances, the hi masses in the sample range from $4\times10^6$ to$6\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$, with a median hi mass of $1\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$.the trgb distances are up to 73% farther than flow-model estimates in thealfalfa catalog. because of the relatively large uncertainties of flow modeldistances, we are biased towards selecting galaxies from the alfalfa catalogwhere the flow model underestimates the true distances. the measured distancesallow for an assessment of the native environments around the sample members.five of the galaxies are part of the ngc 672 and ngc 784 groups, which togetherconstitute a single structure. one galaxy is part of a larger linear ensembleof 9 systems that stretches 1.6 mpc from end to end. two galaxies reside inregions with 1-4 neighbors, and four galaxies are truly isolated with no knownsystem identified within a radius of 1 mpc.

0804.0543	the initial mass function of the stellar association ngc 602 in the  small magellanic cloud with hubble space telescope acs observations	we present our photometric study of the stellar association ngc 602 in thewing of the small magellanic cloud (smc). the data were taken in the filtersf555w and f814w using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on-board the hubblespace telescope (hst). photometry was performed using the acs module of thestellar photometry package dolphot. we detected more than 5,500 stars with amagnitude range of 14 \lsim m_{555} \lsim 28 mag. three prominent stellarconcentrations are identified with star counts in the observed field, theassociation ngc 602 itself, and two clusters, one of them not being currentlyin any known catalog. the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of both clusters showfeatures typical for young open clusters, while that of the association revealsbright main sequence (ms) and faint pre-main sequence (pms) stars as themembers of the system. we construct the initial mass spectrum (ims) of theassociation by applying an age-independent method of counting the pms starswithin evolutionary tracks, while for the bright ms stars we transform theirmagnitudes to masses with the use of mass-luminosity relations. the ims of ngc602 is found to be well represented by a single-power law, corresponding to aninitial mass function (imf) of slope \gamma\approx -1.2 for 1 \lsim m/m{\solar}\lsim 45. this indicates that the shape of the imf of a star forming system inthe smc for stars with masses higher than 1 m{\solar} seems to be quite similarto the field imf in the solar neighborhood.

1501.07313	characterizing the star formation of the low-mass shield galaxies from  hubble space telescope imaging	the survey of hi in extremely low-mass dwarfs (shield) is an on-goingmulti-wavelength program to characterize the gas, star formation, and evolutionin gas-rich, very low-mass galaxies that populate the faint end of the galaxyluminosity function. the galaxies were selected from the first ~10% of the hialfalfa survey based on their low hi mass and low baryonic mass. here, wemeasure the star-formation properties from optically resolved stellarpopulations for 12 galaxies using a color-magnitude diagram fitting technique.we derive lifetime average star-formation rates (sfrs), recent sfrs, stellarmasses, and gas fractions. overall, the recent sfrs are comparable to thelifetime sfrs with mean birthrate parameter of 1.4, with a surprisingly narrowstandard deviation of 0.7. two galaxies are classified as dwarf transitiongalaxies (dtrans). these dtrans systems have star-formation and gas propertiesconsistent with the rest of the sample, in agreement with previous results thatsome dtrans galaxies may simply be low-luminosity dirrs. we do not find acorrelation between the recent star-formation activity and the distance to thenearest neighboring galaxy, suggesting that the star-formation process is notdriven by gravitational interactions, but regulated internally. further, wefind a broadening in the star-formation and gas properties (i.e., specificsfrs, stellar masses, and gas fractions) compared to the generally tightcorrelation found in more massive galaxies. overall, the star-formation and gasproperties indicate these very low-mass galaxies host a fluctuating,non-deterministic, and inefficient star-formation process.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1505.00791	calibrating uv star formation rates for dwarf galaxies from starbirds	integrating our knowledge of star formation traced by observations atdifferent wavelengths is essential for correctly interpreting and comparingstar formation activity in a variety of systems and environments. this studycompares extinction corrected integrated ultraviolet (uv) emission fromresolved galaxies with color-magnitude diagram (cmd) based star formation rates(sfrs) derived from resolved stellar populations and cmd fitting techniques in19 nearby starburst and post-starburst dwarf galaxies. the datasets are fromthe panchromatic starburst irregular dwarf survey (starbirds) and include deeplegacy galex uv imaging, hst optical imaging, and spitzer mips imaging. for themajority of the sample, the integrated near uv fluxes predicted from thecmd-based sfrs - using four different models - agree with the measured,extinction corrected, integrated near uv fluxes from galex images, but the faruv predicted fluxes do not. further, we find a systematic deviation between thesfrs based on integrated far uv luminosities and existing scaling relations,and the sfrs based on the resolved stellar populations. this offset is notdriven by different star formation timescales, variations in sfrs, uvattenuation, nor stochastic effects. this first comparison between cmd-basedsfrs and an integrated fuv emission sfr indicator suggests that the most likelycause of the discrepancy is the theoretical fuv-sfr calibration from stellarevolutionary libraries and/or stellar atmospheric models. we present anempirical calibration of the fuv-based sfr relation for dwarf galaxies, withuncertainties, which is ~53% larger than previous relations.

0805.1058	delving deeper into the tumultuous lives of galactic dwarfs: modeling  star formation histories	the paucity of observed dwarf galaxies in the local group relative to theabundance of predicted dark matter halos remains one of the greatest puzzles ofthe lcdm paradigm. solving this puzzle now requires not only matching thenumbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formationhistories. we present a summary of such histories derived from the hst datausing the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. to reduce observationaluncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters -- thefractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 gyr, and the meanstellar age. we interpret the new data with a phenomenological model based onthe mass assembly histories of dark matter halos and the schmidt law of starformation. the model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfsand the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 gyr. however, in orderto be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amountof recent star formation in the last 2 gyr. within the framework of our model,this prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variationin the density threshold of the star formation law. the model results are notsensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the schmidt law, or the detailsof cosmic reionization. a few discrepancies still remain: our model typicallypredicts too large stellar masses, only a modest population of ultra-faintdwarfs, and a small number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellarpopulations. nevertheless, the observed star formation histories of local groupdwarfs are generally consistent the expected star formation in cold dark matterhalos.

1510.08533	a hubble space telescope study of the enigmatic milky way halo globular  cluster crater	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of the faint stellar system,crater, based on deep optical imaging taken with the hubble space telescope.the hst/acs-based color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of crater extends $\sim$4magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, providing excellent leverageon crater's physical properties. structurally, crater has a half-light radiusof $\sim$20 pc and shows no evidence for tidal distortions. crater iswell-described by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$7.5 gyr,[m/h]$\sim-1.65$, a m$_{\star}\sim10^4$ m$_{\odot}$, m$_{\rm v}\sim -5.3$,located at a distance of d$\sim$ 145 kpc, with modest uncertainties in theseproperties due to differences in the underlying stellar evolution models. thesparse sampling of stars above the turnoff and sub-giant branch are likely tobe 1.0-1.4 m$_{\odot}$ binary star systems (blue stragglers) and their evolveddescendants, as opposed to intermediate age main sequence stars. confusion ofthese populations highlights a substantial challenge in accuratelycharacterizing sparsely populated stellar systems. our analysis shows thatcrater is not a dwarf galaxy, but instead is an unusually young cluster givenits location in the milky way's very outer stellar halo. crater is similar tosmc cluster lindsay 38, and its position and velocity are in good agreementwith observations and models of the magellanic stream debris, suggesting it mayhave accreted from the magellanic clouds. however, its age and metallicity arealso in agreement with the age-metallicity relationships of lower mass dwarfgalaxies such as leo i or carina. despite uncertainty over its progenitorsystem, crater appears to have been incorporated into the galaxy more recentlythan $z\sim1$ (8 gyr ago), providing an important new constraint on theaccretion history of the milky way.

astro-ph;9904316	hst studies of the wlm galaxy. i. the age and metallicity of the  globular cluster	we have obtained v and i images of the lone globular cluster that belongs tothe dwarf local group irregular galaxy known as wlm. the color-magnitudediagram of the cluster shows that it is a normal old globular cluster with awell-defined giant branch reaching to m_v=-2.5, a horizontal branch atm_v=+0.5, and a sub-giant branch extending to our photometry limit of m_v=+2.0.a best fit to theoretical isochrones indicates that this cluster has ametallicity of [fe/h]=-1.52\pm0.08 and an age of 14.8\pm0.6 gyr, thusindicating that it is similar to normal old halo globulars in our galaxy. fromthe fit we also find that the distance modulus of the cluster is 24.73\pm0.07and the extinction is a_v=0.07\pm0.06, both values that agree within the errorswith data obtained for the galaxy itself by others. we conclude that thisnormal massive cluster was able to form during the formation of wlm, despitethe parent galaxy's very small intrinsic mass and size.

0809.5059	the recent star formation histories of m81 group dwarf irregular  galaxies	we present observations and analysis of nine dwarf irregular galaxies (dis)in the m81 group taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope. the nine galaxy sample (the garland, m81 dwarf a, ddo 53, hoix, ho i, ddo 165, ngc 2366, ho ii, and ic 2574) spans 6 magnitudes inluminosity, a factor of 1000 in current star formation rate, and 0.5 dex inmetallicity. here we use color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellarpopulations to study the star formation histories (sfhs) of these galaxies. wedivide the sample into faint and bright galaxies, with a dividing line ofm_${b}$ = -15, and then analyze the similarities and differences in the sfhs,birthrate parameters, fraction of stars formed per time interval, and spatialdistribution of stellar components. comparing these parameters as a function ofluminosity, we find only minor differences in sf characteristics. we extend ourcomparison to select dis in the local group (lg), and find only minordifferences in sf parameters. the fraction of stars formed per time intervalfor an average m81 group and lg di is consistent with a constant sfh. however,individual galaxies can show significant departures from a constant sfh. thus,we find this result underlines the importance of stochastic sf in dis. we alsocompare possible formation scenarios of the less luminous and candidate tidaldwarfs in the m81 group. the sfhs and the lack of an overdensity of associatedred stars suggest that the garland and ho ix are not dis and are potentiallytidal dwarf galaxies. interestingly, a noteworthy difference between the lg andthe m81 group is the lack of tidal dwarf candidates in the lg.

0812.2036	triggered star formation and the creation of the supergiant hi shell in  ic 2574	based on deep imaging from the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope, we present new evidence that stellar feedback created a ~ 1kpc supergiant hi shell (sgs) and triggered star formation (sf) around its rimin the m81 group dwarf irregular galaxy ic 2574. using photometry of theresolved stars from the hst images, we measure the star formation history of aregion including the sgs, focusing on the past 500 myr, and employ the uniqueproperties of blue helium burning stars to create a movie of sf in the sgs. wefind two significant episodes of sf inside the sgs from 200 - 300 myr and ~ 25myr ago. comparing the timing of the sf events to the dynamic age of the sgsand the energetics from the hi and sf, we find compelling evidence that stellarfeedback is responsible for creating the sgs and triggering secondary sf aroundits rim.
