1001.3067	direct detection of galaxy stellar halos : ngc 3957 as a test case	we present a direct detection of the stellar halo of the edge-on s0 galaxyngc 3957, using ultra-deep vlt/vimos v and r images. this is achieved with asky subtraction strategy based on infrared techniques. these observations allowus to reach unprecedented high signal-to-noise ratios up to 15 kpc away fromthe galaxy center, rendering photon-noise negligible. the 1 sigma detectionlimits are r = 30.6 mag/arcsec^2 and v = 31.4 mag/arcsec^2. we conduct athorough analysis of the possible sources of systematic errors that couldaffect the data: flat-fielding, differences in ccd responses, scaling of thesky background, the extended halo itself, and psf wings. we conclude that thev-r colour of the ngc 3957 halo, calculated between 5 and 8 kpc above the discplane where the systematic errors are modest, is consistent with an old andpreferentially metal-poor normal stellar population, like that revealed innearby galaxy halos from studies of their resolved stellar content. we do notfind support for the extremely red colours found in earlier studies of diffusehalo emission, which we suggest might have been due to residual systematicerrors.

1002.4991	first case of strong gravitational lensing by a qso : sdss j0013+1523 at  z = 0.120	we present the first case of strong gravitational lensing by a qso : sdssj0013+1523, at z = 0.120. the discovery is the result of a systematic searchfor emission lines redshifted behind qsos, among 22298 spectra of the sdss datarelease 7. apart from the z = 0.120 spectral features of the foreground qso,the spectrum of sdss j0013+1523 also displays the oii and hbeta emission linesand the oiii doublet, all at the same redshift, z = 0.640. using sharp keckadaptive optics k-band images obtained using laser guide stars, we unveil twoobjects within a radius of 2 arcsec from the qso. deep keck opticalspectroscopy clearly confirms one of these objects at z = 0.640 and showstraces of the oiii, emission line of the second object, also at z = 0.640. lensmodeling suggests that they represent two images of the same z = 0.640emission-line galaxy. our keck spectra also allow us to measure the redshift ofan intervening galaxy at z = 0.394, located 3.2 arcsec away from the line ofsight to the qso. if the z = 0.120 qso host galaxy is modeled as a singularisothermal sphere, its mass within the einstein radius is m_e(r &lt; 1 kpc) =2.16e10 m_sun and its velocity dispersion is sigma_sis = 169 km/s. this isabout 1 sigma away from the velocity dispersion estimated from the width of theqso hbeta emission line, sigma_*(m_bh) = 124 +/- 47 km/s. deep optical hstimaging will be necessary to constrain the total radial mass profile of the qsohost galaxy using the detailed shape of the lensed source. this first case of aqso acting as a strong lens on a more distant object opens new directions inthe study of qso host galaxies.

1106.0927	on the effect of image denoising on galaxy shape measurements	weak gravitational lensing is a very sensitive way of measuring cosmologicalparameters, including dark energy, and of testing current theories ofgravitation. in practice, this requires exquisite measurement of the shapes ofbillions of galaxies over large areas of the sky, as may be obtained with theeuclid and wfirst satellites. for a given survey depth, applying imagedenoising to the data both improves the accuracy of the shape measurements andincreases the number density of galaxies with a measurable shape. we performsimple tests of three different denoising techniques, using synthetic data. wepropose a new and simple denoising method, based on wavelet decomposition ofthe data and a wiener filtering of the resulting wavelet coefficients. whenapplied to the great08 challenge dataset, this technique allows us to improvethe quality factor of the measurement (q; great08 definition), by up to afactor of two. we demonstrate that the typical pixel size of the euclid opticalchannel will allow us to use image denoising.

1112.0005	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses x.  modeling based on high-precision astrometry of a sample of 25 lensed quasars:  consequences for ellipticity, shear, and astrometric anomalies	(abridged) gravitationally lensed quasars can be used as powerfulcosmological and astrophysical probes. we can (i) infer the hubble constantbased on the time-delay technique, (ii) unveil substructures along the l.o.s.toward distant galaxies, and (iii) compare the shape and the slope of baryonsand dark matter distributions in galaxies. to reach these goals, we needhigh-accuracy astrometry and morphology measurements of the lens. in this work,we first present new astrometry for 11 lenses with measured time delays. usingmcs deconvolution on nic2 hst images, we reached an astrometric accuracy ofabout 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. second,we combined these measurements with those of 14 other systems to present newmass models of these lenses. this led to the following results: 1) in 4double-image quasars, we show that the influence of the lens environment on thetime delay can easily be quantified and modeled, hence putting these lenseswith high priority for time-delay determination. 2) for quadruple-imagequasars, the difficulty often encountered in reproducing the image positions tomilli-arcsec accuracy (astrometric anomaly) is overcome by explicitly includingthe nearest visible galaxy in the model. however, one anomalous system(j1131-1231) does not show any luminous perturber in its vicinity, and threeothers (wfi2026-4536, wfi2033-4723, and b2045+265) have problematic modeling.these 4 systems are the best candidates for a pertubation by a dark mattersubstructure. 3) we find a significant correlation between the pa of the lightand of the mass distributions in lensing galaxies. in contrast with otherstudies, we find that the ellipticity of the light and of the mass alsocorrelate well, suggesting that the overall spatial distribution of matter isnot very different from the baryon distribution in the inner \sim 5 kpc oflensing galaxies.

1206.0731	microlensing of the broad line region in 17 lensed quasars	when an image of a strongly lensed quasar is microlensed, the differentcomponents of its spectrum are expected to be differentially magnified owing tothe different sizes of the corresponding emitting region. chromatic changes areexpected to be observed in the continuum while the emission lines should bedeformed as a function of the size, geometry and kinematics of the regions fromwhich they originate. microlensing of the emission lines has been reported onlyin a handful of systems so far. in this paper we search for microlensingdeformations of the optical spectra of pairs of images in 17 lensed quasars.this sample is composed of 13 pairs of previously unpublished spectra and fourpairs of spectra from literature. our analysis is based on a spectraldecomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction ofthe flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines.using this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85% of thesystems. among them, 80% show microlensing of the broad emission lines.focusing on the most common lines in our spectra (ciii] and mgii) we detectmicrolensing of either the blue or the red wing, or of both wings with the sameamplitude. this observation implies that the broad line region is not ingeneral spherically symmetric. in addition, the frequent detection ofmicrolensing of the blue and red wings independently but not simultaneouslywith a different amplitude, does not support existing microlensing simulationsof a biconical outflow. our analysis also provides the intrinsic flux ratiobetween the lensed images and the magnitude of the microlensing affecting thecontinuum. these two quantities are particularly relevant for the determinationof the fraction of matter in clumpy form in galaxies and for the detection ofdark matter substructures via the identification of flux ratio anomalies.

1210.2696	interpolating point spread function anisotropy	planned wide-field weak lensing surveys are expected to reduce thestatistical errors on the shear field to unprecedented levels. in contrast,systematic errors like those induced by the convolution with the point spreadfunction (psf) will not benefit from that scaling effect and will require veryaccurate modeling and correction. while numerous methods have been devised tocarry out the psf correction itself, modeling of the psf shape and its spatialvariations across the instrument field of view has, so far, attracted much lessattention. this step is nevertheless crucial because the psf is only known atstar positions while the correction has to be performed at any position on thesky. a reliable interpolation scheme is therefore mandatory and a popularapproach has been to use low-order bivariate polynomials. in the present paper,we evaluate four other classical spatial interpolation methods based on splines(b-splines), inverse distance weighting (idw), radial basis functions (rbf) andordinary kriging (ok). these methods are tested on the star-challenge part ofthe gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) simulated data andare compared with the classical polynomial fitting (polyfit). we also test allour interpolation methods independently of the way the psf is modeled, byinterpolating the great10 star fields themselves (i.e., the psf parameters areknown exactly at star positions). we find in that case rbf to be the clearwinner, closely followed by the other local methods, idw and ok. the globalmethods, polyfit and b-splines, are largely behind, especially in fields with(ground-based) turbulent psfs. in fields with non-turbulent psfs, allinterpolators reach a variance on psf systematics $\sigma_{sys}^2$ better thanthe $1\times10^{-7}$ upper bound expected by future space-based surveys, withthe local interpolators performing better than the global ones.

1306.1272	dark energy with gravitational lens time delays	strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effectiveprobe of dark energy. recent studies have shown that a single lens can providea distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematicuncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the timedelay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow oneto break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probeslike the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation ofstate. current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensedquasars, but this situation is about to change. even in this decade, wide fieldimaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enablingthe targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gainsin the dark energy figure of merit. in the next decade, a further order ofmagnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to bedetected and measured with lsst and euclid. to fully exploit these gains, weidentify three priorities. first, support for the development of softwarerequired for the analysis of the data. second, in this decade, small robotictelescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars willtransform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. third,in the 2020's, lsst will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck willinstead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolutionimaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the james webb space telescopeand next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

1306.5105	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses xiv.  time delay of the doubly lensed quasar sdss j1001+5027	this paper presents optical r-band light curves and the time delay of thedoubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar sdss j1001+5027 at a redshift of1.838. we have observed this target for more than six years, between march 2005and july 2011, using the 1.2-m mercator telescope, the 1.5-m telescope of themaidanak observatory, and the 2-m himalayan chandra telescope. our resultinglight curves are composed of 443 independent epochs, and show strong intrinsicquasar variability, with an amplitude of the order of 0.2 magnitudes. from thisdata, we measure the time delay using five different methods, all relying ondistinct approaches. one of these techniques is a new development presented inthis paper. all our time-delay measurements are perfectly compatible. bycombining them, we conclude that image a is leading b by 119.3 +/- 3.3 days (1sigma, 2.8% uncertainty), including systematic errors. it has been shownrecently that such accurate time-delay measurements offer a highlycomplementary probe of dark energy and spatial curvature, as they independentlyconstrain the hubble constant. the next mandatory step towards using sdssj1001+5027 in this context will be the measurement of the velocity dispersionof the lensing galaxy, in combination with deep hubble space telescope imaging.

0802.1386	understanding the relations between qsos and their host galaxies from  combined hst imaging and vlt spectroscopy	the host galaxies of six nearby qsos are studied on the basis of highresolution hst optical images and spatially resolved vlt slit spectra. the gasionization and velocity are mapped as a function of the distance to the centralqso. in the majority of the cases, the qso significantly contributes to the gasionization in its whole host galaxy, and sometimes even outside.  reflection or scattering of the qso \ha line from remote regions of thegalaxy is detected in several instances. the line shifts show that, in allcases, the matter responsible for the light reflection moves away from the qso,likely accelerated by its radiation pressure.  the two faintest qsos reside in spirals, with some signs of a pastgravitational perturbation. one of the intermediate luminosity qsos resides ina massive elliptical containing gas ionized (and probably pushed away) by theqso radiation. the other medium-power object is found in a spiral galaxydisplaying complex velocity structure, with the central qso moving with respectto the bulge, probably as a result of a galactic collision. the two mostpowerful objects are involved in violent gravitational interactions and one ofthem has no detected host.  these results suggest that (1) large-scale phenomena, such as galacticcollisions, are closely related to the triggering and the feeding of the qsoand (2) once ignited, the qso has significant influence on its large-scaleneighborhood (often the whole host and sometimes further away).

1403.1063	a pca-based automated finder for galaxy-scale strong lenses	we present an algorithm using principal component analysis (pca) to subtractgalaxies from imaging data, and also two algorithms to find strong,galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in the resulting residual image. the combinedmethod is optimized to find full or partial einstein rings. starting from apre-selection of potential massive galaxies, we first perform a pca to build aset of basis vectors. the galaxy images are reconstructed using the pca basisand subtracted from the data. we then filter the residual image with twodifferent methods. the first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of theresidual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. the resulting image istransformed in polar coordinates, centered on the lens galaxy center. in thesecoordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faintrings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a linein polar coordinates). the second way of analysing the pca-subtracted imagesidentifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they arelensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity and elongation. weapply the two methods to a sample of simulated einstein rings, as they would beobserved with the esa euclid satellite in the vis band. the polar coordinatestransform allows us to reach a completeness of 90% and a purity of 86%, as soonas the signal-to-noise integrated in the ring is higher than 30, and almostindependent of the size of the einstein ring. finally, we show with real datathat our pca-based galaxy subtraction scheme performs better than traditionalsubtraction based on model fitting to the data. our algorithm can be developedand improved further using machine learning and dictionary learning methods,which would extend the capabilities of the method to more complex and diversegalaxy shapes.

(2008).we find that the brighter quasars also have the brighter envelopes but that theextend of the envelopes does not depend on the quasar luminosity. although ourresults are based on only two objects with a detected lyman alpha, envelope,the quality of the spatial deblending of the spectra lends considerable hope toestimate the luminosity function and surface brightness profiles of highredshift lyman alpha, envelopes down to f= 2-3 10^{-21} erg/s/cm^2/a. we findthat the best strategy to carry out such a project is to obtain bothnarrow-band images and deep slit-spectra.

1512.01549	evaluating the effect of stellar multiplicity on the psf of space-based  weak lensing surveys	the next generation of space-based telescopes used for weak lensing surveyswill require exquisite point spread function (psf) determination. previouslynegligible effects may become important in the reconstruction of the psf, inpart because of the improved spatial resolution. in this paper, we show thatunresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the psfand that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in thereconstruction process. we estimate the error in the reconstruction of the psfdue to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with imagesimulations for different psfs and stellar populations. the simulations supportour analytical finding that the error on the size of the psf is a function ofthe multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of thepsf, i.e. if all stars were single. similarly, the modification of each of thecomplex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiplestars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity. using image simulations, wealso show that the predicted error in the psf shape is a theoretical limit thatcan be reached only if large number of stars (up to thousands) are usedtogether to build the psf at any desired spatial position. for a lower numberof stars, the psf reconstruction is worse. finally, we compute the effect ofbinarity for different stellar magnitudes and show that bright stars alter thepsf size and ellipticity more than faint stars. this may affect the design ofpsf calibration strategies and the choice of the related calibration fields.

astro-ph;0006168	exploring the gravitationally lensed system he 1104-1805: near-ir  spectroscopy	(abridged) a new technique for the spatial deconvolution of spectra isapplied to near-ir (0.95 - 2.50 micron) ntt/sofi spectra of the lensed,radio-quiet quasar he 1104-1805. the continuum of the lensing galaxy isrevealed between 1.5 and 2.5 micron. it is used in combination with previousoptical and ir photometry to infer a plausible redshift in the range 0.8 &lt; z &lt;1.2. modeling of the system shows that the lens is probably composed of the redgalaxy seen between the quasar images and a more extended component associatedwith a galaxy cluster with fairly low velocity dispersion (~ 575 km/s). thespectra of the two lensed images of the source show no trace of reddening atthe redshift of the lens nor at the redshift of the source. additionally, thedifference between the spectrum of the brightest component a nd that of ascaled version of the faintest component is a featureless continuum. broad andnarrow emission lines, including the feii features, are perfectly subtracted.the very good quality of our spectrum makes it possible to fit precisely theoptical fe ii feature, taking into account the underlying continuum over a widewavelength range. he 1104-1805 can be classified as a weak fe ii emitter.finally, the slope of the continuum in the brightest image is steeper than thecontinuum in the faintest image and supports the finding by wisotzki et al.(1993) that the brightest image is microlensed. this is particularlyinteresting in view of the new source reconstruction methods frommultiwavelength photometric monitoring.

astro-ph;0606317	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses v. the  time delay in sdss j1650+4251	aims: our aim is to measure the time delay between the two gravitationallylensed images of the z = 1.547 quasar sdss j1650+4251, in order to estimate thehubble constant h_0.  methods: our measurement is based on r-band light curves with 57 epochsobtained at maidanak observatory, in uzbekistan, from may 2004 to september2005. the photometry is performed using simultaneous deconvolution of the data,which provides the individual light curves of the otherwise blended quasarimages. the time delay is determined from the light curves using two verydifferent numerical techniques, i.e., polynomial fitting and directcross-correlation. the time delay is converted into h_0 following analyticalmodeling of the potential well.  results: our best estimate of the time delay is dt = 49.5 +/- 1.9 days, i.e.,we reach a 3.8% accuracy. the r-band flux ratio between the quasar images,corrected for the time delay and for slow microlensing, is f_a /f_b = 6.2 +/-5%.  conclusions: the accuracy reached on the time delay allows us to discriminatewell between families of lens models. as for most other multiply imagedquasars, only models of the lensing galaxy that have a de vaucouleurs massprofile plus external shear give a hubble constant compatible with the currentmost popular value (h_0 = 72 +/- 8 km s-1 mpc-1). a more realistic singularisothermal sphere model plus external shear gives h_0 = 51.7 +4.0 -3.0 km s-1mpc-1.

astro-ph;0606395	high accuracy transit photometry of the planet ogle-tr-113b with a new  deconvolution-based method	a high accuracy photometry algorithm is needed to take full advantage of thepotential of the transit method for the characterization of exoplanets,especially in deep crowded fields. it has to reduce to the lowest possiblelevel the negative influence of systematic effects on the photometric accuracy.it should also be able to cope with a high level of crowding and with largescale variations of the spatial resolution from one image to another. a recentdeconvolution-based photometry algorithm fulfills all these requirements, andit also increases the resolution of astronomical images, which is an importantadvantage for the detection of blends and the discrimination of false positivesin transit photometry. we made some changes to this algorithm in order tooptimize it for transit photometry and used it to reduce ntt/susi2 observationsof two transits of ogle-tr-113b. this reduction has led to two very highprecision transit light curves with a low level of systematic residuals, usedtogether with former photometric and spectroscopic measurements to derive newstellar and planetary parameters in excellent agreement with previous ones, butsignificantly more precise.

astro-ph;0609600	a deconvolution-based algorithm for crowded field photometry with  unknown point spread function	a new method is presented for determining the point spread function (psf) ofimages that lack bright and isolated stars. it is based on the same principlesas the mcs (magain, courbin, sohy, 1998) image deconvolution algorithm. it usesthe information contained in all stellar images to achieve the double task ofreconstructing the psfs for single or multiple exposures of the same field andto extract the photometry of all point sources in the field of view. the use ofthe full information available allows to construct an accurate psf. thepossibility to simultaneously consider several exposures makes it very wellsuited to the measurement of the light curves of blended point sources fromdata that would be very difficult or even impossible to analyse withtraditional psf fitting techniques. the potential of the method for theanalysis of ground-based and space-based data is tested on artificial imagesand illustrated by several examples, including hst/nicmos images of a lensedquasar and vlt/isaac images of a faint blended mira star in the halo of thegiant elliptical galaxy ngc5128 (cen a).

astro-ph;0612419	cosmograil: the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses vi.  redshift of the lensing galaxy in seven gravitationally lensed quasars	aims: the knowledge of the redshift of a lensing galaxy that producesmultiple images of a background quasar is essential to any subsequent modeling,whether related to the determination of the hubble constant h_0 or to the massprofile of the lensing galaxy. we present the results of our ongoingspectroscopic observations of gravitationally lensed quasars in order tomeasure the redshift of their lensing galaxies. we report on the determinationof the lens redshift in seven gravitationally lensed systems.  methods: our deep vlt/fors1 spectra are spatially deconvolved in order toseparate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the muchbrighter quasar images. our observing strategy involves observations inmulti-object-spectroscopy (mos) mode which allows the simultaneous observationof the target and of several crucial psf and flux calibration stars. theadvantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is that itallows a much more reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra.  results: we obtain the first reliable spectra of the lensing galaxies in sixlensed quasars: fbq 0951+2635 (z=0.260), bri 0952-0115 (z=0.632), he 2149-2745(z=0.603), q 0142-100 (z=0.491), sdss j0246-0825 (z=0.723), and sdss j0806+2006(z=0.573). the last 3 redshifts also correspond to the mgii doublet seen inabsorption in the quasar spectra at the lens redshift. our spectroscopicredshifts of he 2149-2745 and fbq 0951+2635 are higher than previouslyreported, which means that h_0 estimates from these two systems must be revisedto higher values. finally, we reanalyse our spectra of q 1355-2257 and findmgii in absorption at z=0.702, confirming our previous redshift estimate. thespectra of all lenses are typical of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0701155	discovery of a probable physical triple quasar	we report the discovery of the first known probable case of a physical triplequasar (not a gravitational lens). a previously known double system, qq1429-008 at z = 2.076, is shown to contain a third, fainter qso component atthe same redshift within the measurement errors. deep optical and ir imaging atthe keck and vlt telescopes has failed to reveal a plausible lensing galaxygroup or a cluster, and moreover, we are unable to construct any viable lensingmodel which could lead to the observed distribution of source positions andrelative intensities of the three qso image components. furthermore, there arehints of differences in broad-band spectral energy distributions of differentcomponents, which are more naturally understood if they are physically distinctagn. therefore, we conclude that this system is most likely a physical triplequasar, the first such close qso grouping known at any redshift. the projectedcomponent separations in the restframe are ~ 30 - 50 kpc for the standardconcordance cosmology, typical of interacting galaxy systems. the existence ofthis highly unusual system supports the standard picture in which galaxyinteractions lead to the onset of qso activity.

astro-ph;9504053	photometric monitoring (1987 to 1994) of the gravitational lens  candidate um 425	we present the results of a 7 year long photometric monitoring of twocomponents (a and b) of um 425, thought to be images, separated by 6.5", of thesame z = 1.47 quasar. these components have been imaged through an r filter inorder to obtain their light curves. the photometry was obtained bysimultaneously fitting a stellar two-dimensional profile on each component. thebrightest image (component a, m(r) = 15.7) shows a slow and smooth increase inbrightness of 0.2 magnitude in seven years, while the faintest one (componentb, m(r) = 20.1) displays an outburst of 0.4 magnitude which lasts approximatelytwo years. the variation of component b may be interpreted in two ways,assuming um 425 is gravitationally lensed. if it is due to an intrinsicvariation of the quasar, we derive a lower limit of 3 years on the time delayfrom the fact that it is not observed in component a. on the other hand, if itis a microlensing ``high amplification event'', we estimate the size of thesource to be ~ 10^{-3} pc, in agreement with standard models of agns. theseobservations are consistent with the gravitational lens interpretation of theobject.  furthermore, all the ccd frames obtained under the best seeing conditionshave been co-added, in an attempt to detect the deflector. the final r imagereveals a rich field of faint galaxies in the magnitude range m(r) 22-24. noobvious deflector, nor any system of arcs or arclets is detected, down to alimiting magnitude of m(r) 24.

astro-ph;9706052	the lmc transition star r84 and the core of the lh 39 ob association	on the basis of sub-arcsecond optical imaging we resolve and study the corecomponents of the lmc ob association lh 39. the central star of theassociation, the rare transition object r84, is also investigated using caspecechelle spectroscopy. a new, powerful image restoration code that conserves thefluxes allows us to obtain the magnitudes and colors of the components. webring out some 30 stars in a ~16"x16", area centered on r84. at a resolution of0.19", the closest components to r84 are shown to lie at 1.1" nw and 1.7" nwrespectively of the transition star. one of these stars is the reddest star ofthe field after r84 but turns out to be too faint to correspond to the red m2supergiant previously reported to contaminate the spectrum of r84. if thelate-type spectrum is due to a line-of-sight supergiant with a luminositycomparable to r84, it should lie closer than 0.12" to r84. the transition starshows spectral variability between 1982 and 1991. we also note some slightradial velocity variations of the of emission lines over timescales of severalyears. furthermore, we discuss the apparent absence of o type stars in thisassociation.

astro-ph;9706146	stellar populations from adaptive optics observations: four test cases	we describe a first attempt to apply adaptive optics to the study of resolvedstellar populations in galaxies. advantages over traditional approaches are (i)improved spatial resolution and point-source sensitivity through adaptiveoptics, and (ii) use of the near-infrared region, where the peak of thespectral energy distribution for old populations is found. disadvantages arethe small area covered and the need for excellent seeing. we made observationswith the adonis system at the european southern observatory of the peculiarelliptical galaxy ngc 5128; the irregular galaxy ic 5152 (a possible outermember of the local group); the sc galaxy ngc 300 (a member of the sculptorgroup); and the sgr window in the bulge of the milky way. these differentfields give excellent test cases for the potential of adaptive optics. in thefirst two cases, we failed to obtain photometry of individual stars, whichwould have required excellent seeing. for ngc 300 we measured magnitudes fornine individual supergiants (h = 18.3 to 20.2), but did not go deep enough todetect the tip of the rgb of an old population. for the sgr field we produced ainfrared luminosity function and colour-magnitude diagram for 70 stars down toabout k = 19.5. these are the deepest yet measured for the galactic bulge,reaching beyond the turn-off.

0809.2980	a sharp look at the gravitationally lensed quasar sdss j0806+2006 with  laser guide star adaptive optics	we present the first vlt near-ir observations of a gravitationally lensedquasar, using adaptive optics and laser guide star. these observations can beconsidered as a test bench for future systematic observations of lensed quasarswith adaptive optics, even when bright natural guide stars are not available inthe nearby field. with only 14 minutes of observing time, we derived veryaccurate astrometry of the quasar images and of the lensing galaxy, with 0.05\arcsec spatial resolution, comparable to the hubble space telescope (hst). incombination with deep vlt optical spectra of the quasar images, we use ouradaptive optics images to constrain simple models for the mass distribution ofthe lensing galaxy. the latter is almost circular and does not need any strongexternal shear to fit the data. the time delay predicted for sdss0806+2006,assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid model and the concordance cosmology,is delta t \simeq 50 days. our optical spectra indicate a flux ratio betweenthe quasar images of a/b=1.3 in the continuum and a/b=2.2 in both the mgii andin the ciii] broad emission lines. this suggests that microlensing affects thecontinuum emission. however, the constant ratio between the two emission linesindicates that the broad emission line region is not microlensed. finally, wesee no evidence of reddening by dust in the lensing galaxy.

0809.2983	microlensing to probe the quasar structure: spectrophotometry of  q2237+0305 and of j1131-1231	we present the main results of the first long-term spectrophotometricmonitoring of the ``einstein cross'' q2237+0305 and of the single-epoch spectraof the lensed quasar j1131-1231.  from october 2004 to december 2006, we find that two prominent microlensingevents affect images a &amp; b in q2237+0305 while images c &amp; d remain grosslyunaffected by microlensing on a time scale of a few months. microlensing in a &amp;b goes with chromatic variations of the quasar continuum. we observe strongermicro-amplification in the blue than in the red part of the spectrum, asexpected for continuum emission arising from a standard accretion disk.microlensing induced variations of the ciii] emission are observed both in theintegrated line intensity and profile. finally, we also find that images c &amp; dare about 0.1-0.3 mag redder than images a &amp; b. the spectra of images a-b-c inj1131-1231 reveal that, in april 2003, microlensing was at work in images a andc. we find that microlensing de-amplifies the continuum emission and the broadline region (blr) in these images. contrary to the case of q2237+0305, we donot find evidence for chromatic microlensing of the continuum emission. on theother hand, we observe that the balmer and mgii broad line profiles aredeformed by microlensing. these deformations imply an anti-correlation betweenthe width of the emission line and the size of the corresponding emittingregion. finally, the differential microlensing of the feii emission suggeststhat the bulk of feii is emitted in the outer parts of the blr while anotherfraction of feii is produced in a compact region.

astro-ph;9809107	three photometric methods tested on ground-based data of q 2237+0305	the einstein cross, q~2237+0305, has been photometrically observed in fourbands on two successive nights at not (la palma, spain) in october 1995. threeindependent algorithms have been used to analyse the data: an automatic imagedecomposition technique, a clean algorithm and the new mcs deconvolution code.the photometric and astrometric results obtained with the three methods arepresented. no photometric variations were found in the four quasar images.comparison of the photometry from the three techniques shows that bothsystematic and random errors affect each method. when the seeing is worse than1.0", the errors from the automatic image decomposition technique and the cleanalgorithm tend to be large (0.04-0.1 magnitudes) while the deconvolution codestill gives accurate results (1{sigma} error below 0.04) even for frames withseeing as bad as 1.7". reddening is observed in the quasar images and is foundto be compatible with either extinction from the lensing galaxy or colourdependent microlensing. the photometric accuracy depends on the lightdistribution used to model the lensing galaxy. in particular, using a numericalgalaxy model, as done with the mcs algorithm, makes the method less seeingdependent. another advantage of using a numerical model is that eventualnon-homogeneous structures in the galaxy can be modeled. finally, we propose anobservational strategy for a future photometric monitoring of the einsteincross.

astro-ph;9909109	a method for spatial deconvolution of spectra	a method for spatial deconvolution of spectra is presented. it follows thesame fundamental principles as the ``mcs image deconvolution algorithm''(magain, courbin, sohy, 1998) and uses information contained in the spectrum ofa reference point spread function (psf) to spatially deconvolve spectra of veryblended sources. an improved resolution rather than an infinite one is aimedat, overcoming the well known problem of ``deconvolution artefacts''. as in themcs algorithm, the data are decomposed into a sum of analytical point sourcesand a numerically deconvolved background, so that the spectrum of extendedsources in the immediate vicinity of bright point sources may be accuratelyextracted and sharpened. the algorithm has been tested on simulated dataincluding seeing variation as a function of wavelength and atmosphericrefraction. it is shown that the spectra of severely blended point sources canbe resolved while fully preserving the spectrophotometric properties of thedata. extended objects ``hidden'' by bright point sources (up to 4-5 magnitudesbrighter) can be accurately recovered as well, provided the data have asufficiently high total signal-to-noise ratio (200-300 per spectral resolutionelement). such spectra are relatively easy to obtain, even down to faintmagnitudes, within a few hours of integration time with 10m class telescopes.
