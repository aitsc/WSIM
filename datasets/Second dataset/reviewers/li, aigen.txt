1004.2277	anomalous silicate dust emission in the type 1 liner nucleus of m81	we report the detection and successful modeling of the unusual 9.7\mum si--ostretching silicate emission feature in the type 1 (i.e. face-on) liner nucleusof m81. using the infrared spectrograph (irs) instrument on spitzer, wedetermine the feature in the central 230 pc of m81 to be in strong emission,with a peak at ~10.5\mum. this feature is strikingly different in characterfrom the absorption feature of the galactic interstellar medium, and from thesilicate absorption or weak emission features typical of galaxies with activestar formation. we successfully model the high signal-to-noise ratio irsspectra with porous silicate dust using laboratory-acquired mineral spectra. wefind that the most probable fit uses micron-sized, porous grains of amorphoussilicate and graphite. in addition to silicate dust, there is weak pah emissionpresent (particularly at 11.3\mum, arising from the c--h out-of-plane bendingvibration of relatively large pahs of ~500--1000 c atoms) whose characterreflects the low-excitation agn environment, with some evidence that small pahsof ~100--200 c atoms (responsible for the 7.7\mum c--c stretching band) in theimmediate vicinity of the nucleus have been preferentially destroyed.

1107.4313	surveying the agents of galaxy evolution in the tidally-stripped, low  metallicity small magellanic cloud (sage-smc). i. overview	the small magellanic cloud (smc) provides a unique laboratory for the studyof the lifecycle of dust given its low metallicity (~1/5 solar) and relativeproximity (~60 kpc). this motivated the sage-smc (surveying the agents ofgalaxy evolution in the tidally-stripped, low metallicity small magellaniccloud) spitzer legacy program with the specific goals of studying the amountand type of dust in the present interstellar medium, the sources of dust in thewinds of evolved stars, and how much dust is consumed in star formation. thisprogram mapped the full smc (30 sq. deg.) including the body, wing, and tail in7 bands from 3.6 to 160 micron using the irac and mips instruments on thespitzer space telescope. the data were reduced, mosaicked, and the pointsources measured using customized routines specific for large surveys. we havemade the resulting mosaics and point source catalogs available to thecommunity. the infrared colors of the smc are compared to those of other nearbygalaxies and the 8 micron/24 micron ratio is somewhat lower and the 70micron/160 micron ratio is somewhat higher than the average. the globalinfrared spectral energy distribution shows that the smc has ~3x lower aromaticemission/pah (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) abundances compared to mostnearby galaxies. infrared color-magnitude diagrams are given illustrating thedistribution of different asymptotic giant branch stars and the locations ofyoung stellar objects. finally, the average spectral energy distribution (sed)of hii/star formation regions is compared to the equivalent large magellaniccloud average hii/star formation region sed. these preliminary results areexpanded in detail in companion papers.

1109.0999	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of the small magellanic cloud (s4mc):  probing the physical state of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a  low-metallicity environment	we present results of mid-infrared spectroscopic mapping observations of sixstar-forming regions in the small magellanic cloud from the spitzerspectroscopic survey of the smc (s4mc). we detect the mid-ir emission frompolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) in all of the mapped regions, greatlyincreasing the range of environments where pahs have been spectroscopicallydetected in the smc. we investigate the variations of the mid-ir bands in eachregion and compare our results to studies of the pah bands in the sings sampleand in a sample of low-metallicity starburst galaxies. pah emission in the smcis characterized by low ratios of the 6-9 micron features relative to the 11.3micron feature and weak 8.6 and 17.0 micron features. interpreting these bandratios in the light of laboratory and theoretical studies, we find that pahs inthe smc tend to be smaller and less ionized than those in higher metallicitygalaxies. based on studies of pah destruction, we argue that a sizedistribution shifted towards smaller pahs cannot be the result of processing inthe interstellar medium, but instead reflects differences in the formation ofpahs at low metallicity. finally, we discuss the implications of ourobservations for our understanding of the pah life-cycle in low-metallicitygalaxies---namely that the observed deficit of pahs may be a consequence ofpahs forming with smaller average sizes and therefore being more susceptible todestruction under typical interstellar medium conditions.

1210.6562	on the anomalous silicate absorption feature of the prototypical seyfert  2 galaxy ngc 1068	the first detection of the silicate absorption feature in agns was made at9.7 micrometer for the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 over 30 yearsago, indicating the presence of a large column of silicate dust in theline-of-sight to the nucleus. it is now well recognized that type 2 agnsexhibit prominent silicate absorption bands, while the silicate bands of type 1agns appear in emission. more recently, using the mid-infrared interferometricinstrument on the very large telescope interferometer, jaffe et al. (2004) bythe first time spatially resolved the parsec-sized dust torus around ngc 1068and found that the 10 micrometer silicate absorption feature of the innermosthot component exhibits an anomalous profile differing from that of theinterstellar medium and that of common olivine-type silicate dust. while theyascribed the anomalous absorption profile to gehlenite (ca_2al_2sio_7, acalcium aluminum silicate species), we propose a physical dust model and arguethat, although the presence of gehlenite is not ruled out, the anomalousabsorption feature mainly arises from silicon carbide.

1210.6597	a tale of two mysteries in interstellar astrophysics: the 2175 angstrom  extinction bump and diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are ubiquitous absorption spectralfeatures arising from the tenuous material in the space between stars -- theinterstellar medium (ism). since their first detection nearly nine decades ago,over 400 dibs have been observed in the visible and near-infrared wavelengthrange in both the milky way and external galaxies, both nearby and distant.however, the identity of the species responsible for these bands remains as oneof the most enigmatic mysteries in astrophysics.  an equally mysterious interstellar spectral signature is the 2175 angstromextinction bump, the strongest absorption feature observed in the ism. itscarrier also remains unclear since its first detection 46 years ago.  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules have long been proposed as acandidate for dibs as their electronic transitions occur in the wavelengthrange where dibs are often found. in recent years, the 2175 angstrom extinctionbump is also often attributed to the \pi--\pi* transition in pahs. if pahs areindeed responsible for both the 2175 angstrom extinction feature and dibs,their strengths may correlate.  we perform an extensive literature search for lines of sight for which boththe 2175 angstrom extinction feature and dibs have been measured.unfortunately, we found no correlation between the strength of the 2175angstrom feature and the equivalent widths of the strongest dibs. a possibleexplanation might be that dibs are produced by small free gas-phase pahmolecules and ions, while the 2175 angstrom bump is mainly from large pahs orpah clusters in condensed phase so that there is no tight correlation betweendibs and the 2175 angstrom bump.

1210.6856	far-infrared spectroscopy of cationic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons:  zero kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy of pentacene vaporized from  laser desorption	the distinctive set of infrared (ir) emission bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,and 11.3{\mu}m are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysicalenvironments. they are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) molecules. however, not a single pah species has yet been identified inspace, as the mid-ir vibrational bands are mostly representative of functionalgroups and thus do not allow one to fingerprint individual pah molecules. incontrast, the far-ir (fir) bands are sensitive to the skeletal characteristicsof a molecule, hence they are important for chemical identification of unknownspecies.  with an aim to offer laboratory astrophysical data for the herschel spaceobservatory, stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy, and similarfuture space missions, in this work we report neutral and cation firspectroscopy of pentacene (c_22h_14), a five-ring pah molecule. we report threeir active modes of cationic pentacene at 53.3, 84.8, and 266{\mu}m that may bedetectable by space missions such as the safari instrument on board spica.  in the experiment, pentacene is vaporized from a laser desorption source andcooled by a supersonic argon beam. we have obtained results from two-colorresonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization and two-color zero kinetic energyphotoelectron (zeke) spectroscopy. several skeletal vibrational modes of thefirst electronically excited state of the neutral species and those of thecation are assigned, with the aid of ab initio and density functionalcalculations.

1210.7812	the spatial distribution of dust and stellar emission of the magellanic  clouds	we study the emission by dust and stars in the large and small magellanicclouds, a pair of low-metallicity nearby galaxies, as traced by their spatiallyresolved spectral energy distributions (seds). this project combines herschelspace observatory pacs and spire far-infrared photometry with other data atinfrared and optical wavelengths. we build maps of dust and stellar luminosityand mass of both magellanic clouds, and analyze the spatial distribution ofdust/stellar luminosity and mass ratios. these ratios vary considerablythroughout the galaxies, generally between the range $0.01\leq l_{\rmdust}/l_\ast\leq 0.6$ and $10^{-4}\leq m_{\rm dust}/m_\ast\leq 4\times10^{-3}$.we observe that the dust/stellar ratios depend on the interstellar medium (ism)environment, such as the distance from currently or previously star-formingregions, and on the intensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf). inaddition, we construct star formation rate (sfr) maps, and find that the sfr iscorrelated with the dust/stellar luminosity and dust temperature in bothgalaxies, demonstrating the relation between star formation, dust emission andheating, though these correlations exhibit substantial scatter.

0712.2622	determining the dust extinction of gamma-ray burst host galaxies: a  direct method based on optical and x-ray photometry	the dust extinction of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) host galaxies, containingimportant clues to the nature of grb progenitors and crucial for dereddening,is still poorly known. here we propose a straightforward method to determinethe extinction of grb host galaxies by comparing the observed optical spectrato the intrinsic ones extrapolated from the x-ray spectra. the rationale forthis method is from the standard fireball model: if the optical flux decayindex equals to that of the x-ray flux, then there is no break frequencybetween the optical and x-ray bands, therefore we can derive the intrinsicoptical flux from the x-ray spectra. we apply this method to three grbs ofwhich the optical and x-ray fluxes have the same decay indices and another onewith inferred cooling break frequency, and obtain the rest-frame extinctioncurves of their host galaxies. the derived extinction curves are gray and donot resemble any extinction curves of local galaxies (e.g. the milk way, thesmall/large magellanic clouds, or nearby starburst galaxies). the amount ofextinction is rather large (with visual extinction $a_v$ $\sim$1.6--3.4$\magni$). we model the derived extinction curves in terms of thesilicate-graphite interstellar grain model. as expected from the ``gray''nature of the derived extinction curve, the dust size distribution is skewed tolarge grains. we determine, for the first time, the local dust-to-gas ratios ofgrb host galaxies using the model-derived dust parameters and the hydrogencolumn densities determined from x-ray absorptions.

1306.4441	the mid-infrared extinction law and its variation in the coalsack nebula	in recent years the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction from theultraviolet (uv), optical, through the near- and mid-infrared (ir) has beenstudied extensively. although it is well established that the uv/opticalextinction law varies significantly among the different lines of sight, it isnot clear how the ir extinction varies among various environments. in thiswork, using the color-excess method and taking red giants as the extinctiontracer, we determine the interstellar extinction alambda in the fourspitzer/irac bands of the coalsack nebula, a nearby starless dark cloud, basedon the data obtained from the 2mass and spitzer/glimpse surveys. we select fiveindividual regions across the nebula that span a wide variety of physicalconditions, ranging from diffuse, translucent to dense environments, as tracedby the visual extinction, the spitzer/mips 24micron emission, and co emission.we find that alambda/aks, the mid-ir extinction relative to aks, decreases fromdiffuse to dense environments, which may be explained in terms of ineffectivedust growth in dense regions. the mean extinction (relative to aks) iscalculated for the four irac bands as well, which exhibits a flat mid-irextinction law, consistent with previous determinations for other regions. theextinction in the irac 4.5micron band is anomalously high, much higher thanthat of the other three irac bands. it cannot be explained in terms of co andco2 ices. the mid-ir extinction in the four irac bands have also been derivedfor four representative regions in the coalsack globule 2 which respectivelyexhibit strong ice absorption, moderate or weak ice absorption, and very weakor no ice absorption. the derived mid-ir extinction curves are all flat, withalambda/aks increasing with the decrease of the h2o ice absorption opticaldepth.

1307.4014	unidentified species in envelopes around carbon stars	the infrared (ir) spectra of many evolved carbon-rich stars exhibit twoprominent dust emission features peaking around 21um and 30um, with the formerexclusively seen in proto-planetary nebulae (ppne), while the latter seen in amuch wider range of objects, including agb stars, ppne and planetary nebulae(pne). the 30um feature is seen in all the 21um sources, but no correlation isfound between these two features. over a dozen carrier candidates have beenproposed for the 21um feature, but none of them has been widely accepted andthe nature of the 21um feature remains a mystery. the carrier of the 30umfeature also remains unidentied. mgs dust, once widely accepted as a validcarrier, was ruled out because of the sulfur budget problem. in this work weexamine nano-sized feo dust as a carrier for the 21um feature. we calculate their emission spectrum of feo nanodust which undergoes single-photon heating inppne. it is found that the 21um feature emitted by feo nanodust is too broad toexplain the observed feature. for the 30um feature, we argue that graphitecould be a viable carrier. graphite, provided its d.c. conductivity sigma_dcexceeding 100/ohm/cm, exhibits a pronounced band at 30um.

1308.1474	the mid-infrared extinction law in the large magellanic cloud	based on the photometric data from the spitzer/sage survey and with redgiants as the extinction tracers, the mid-infrared (mir) extinction laws in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) are derived for the first time in the form ofa_\lambda/a_ks, the extinction in the four irac bands (i.e., [3.6], [4.5],[5.8] and [8.0]um) relative to the 2mass ks band at 2.16um. we obtain thenear-infrared (nir) extinction coefficient to be e(j-h)/e(h-ks)=1.29\pm0.04 ande(j-ks)/e(h-ks)=1.94\pm0.04. the wavelength dependence of the mir extinctiona_\lambda/a_ks in the lmc varies from one sightline to another. the overallmean mir extinction is a_[3.6]/a_ks=0.72\pm0.03, a_[4.5]/a_ks=0.94\pm0.03,a_[5.8]/a_ks=0.58\pm0.04, and a_[8.0]/a_ks=0.62\pm0.05. except for theextinction in the irac [4.5] band which may be contaminated by the 4.6um co gasabsorption of red giants (which are used to trace the lmc extinction), theextinction in the other three irac bands show a flat curve, close to the milkyway rv = 5.5 model extinction curve (where rv is the optical total-to-selectiveextinction ratio). the possible systematic bias caused by the correlateduncertainties of ks-\lambda and j-ks is explored in terms of monte-carlosimulations. it is found that this could lead to an overestimation ofa_lambda/a_ks in the mir.

1309.1993	the carriers of the interstellar unidentified infrared emission  features: constraints from the interstellar c-h stretching features at  3.2-3.5 micrometers	the unidentified infrared emission (uie) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and11.3 micrometer, commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)molecules, have been recently ascribed to mixed aromatic/aliphatic organicnanoparticles. more recently, an upper limit of &lt;9% on the aliphatic fraction(i.e., the fraction of carbon atoms in aliphatic form) of the uie carriersbased on the observed intensities of the 3.4 and 3.3 micrometer emissionfeatures by attributing them to aliphatic and aromatic c-h stretching modes,respectively, and assuming a_34./a_3.3~0.68 derived from a small set ofaliphatic and aromatic compounds, where a_3.4 and a_3.3 are respectively theband strengths of the 3.4 micrometer aliphatic and 3.3 micrometer aromatic c-hbonds.  to improve the estimate of the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers, herewe analyze 35 uie sources which exhibit both the 3.3 and 3.4 micrometer c-hfeatures and determine i_3.4/i_3.3, the ratio of the power emitted from the 3.4micrometer feature to that from the 3.3 micrometer feature. we derive themedian ratio to be &lt;i_3.4/i_3.3&gt; ~ 0.12. we employ density functional theoryand second-order perturbation theory to compute a_3.4/a_3.3 for a range ofmethyl-substituted pahs. the resulting a_3.4/a_3.3 ratio well exceeds 1.4, withan average ratio of &lt;a_3.4/a_3.3&gt; ~1.76. by attributing the 3.4 micrometerfeature exclusively to aliphatic c-h stretch (i.e., neglecting anharmonicityand superhydrogenation), we derive the fraction of c atoms in aliphatic form tobe ~2%. we therefore conclude that the uie emitters are predominantly aromatic.

1309.1995	on iron monoxide nanoparticles as a carrier of the mysterious 21  micrometer emission feature in post-asymptotic giant branch stars	a prominent, mysterious emission feature peaking at ~20.1 micrometer ---historically known as the ``21 micrometer' feature --- is seen in over twodozen galactic and magellanic cloud carbon-rich post-asymptotic giant branch(post-agb) stars. the nature of its carrier remains unknown since the firstdetection of the 21 micrometer feature in 1989. over a dozen materials havebeen suggested as possible carrier candidates. however, none of them has beenaccepted: they either require too much material (compared to what is availablein the circumstellar shells around these post-agb stars), or exhibit additionalemission features which are not seen in these 21 micrometer sources.  recently, iron monoxide (feo) nanoparticles seem to be a promising carriercandidate as fe is an abundant element and feo emits exclusively at ~21micrometer. in this work, using the proto-typical protoplanetary nebula hd56126 as a test case, we examine feo nanoparticles as a carrier for the 21micrometer feature by modeling their infrared emission, with feo beingstochastically heated by single stellar photons. we find that feo emits toobroad a 21 micrometer feature to explain the observed one and the fe abundancerequired to be locked up in feo exceeds what is available in hd 56126. wetherefore conclude that feo nanoparticles are unlikely responsible for the 21micrometer feature.

1403.7138	spectropolarimetric constraints on the nature of interstellar grains	while it is well recognized that interstellar grains are made of amorphoussilicates and some form of carbonaceous materials, it remains debated regardingwhat exact chemical and physical form the carbonaceous component takes.contemporary grain models assume that the silicate and carbon components areeither physically separated, or they form a core-mantle structure, or theyagglomerate to form porous composites. the core-mantle model posits that themantle is made of some sort of aliphatic hydrocarbon materials and isresponsible for the 3.4 micrometer absorption feature ubiquitously seen in thediffuse interstellar medium (ism) of the milky way and external galaxies. thismodel is challenged by the nondetection of polarization in the 3.4 micrometerabsorption feature as the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature is observed to bepolarized.  to alleviate this challenge, we calculate the degree of polarization of the3.4 micrometer feature for spheroidal silicate dust coated by a layer ofspherical aliphatic hydrocarbon. it is found that the 3.4 micrometer featurepolarization still exceeds the observational upper limit, even though sphericalaliphatic hydrocarbon mantles are expected to cause much less polarization thannonspherical (e.g., spheroidal) mantles.  we have also shown that the composite grain model which consists of amorphoussilicate, aliphatic hydrocarbon, and vacuum also predicts the 3.4 micrometerfeature polarization to well exceed what is observed. these results support theearlier arguments that the aliphatic hydrocarbon component is physicallyseparated from the silicate component unless the 3.4 micrometer absorptionfeature is just a minor carbon sink in the ism.

1403.7266	modeling the infrared interstellar extinction	how dust scatters and absorbs starlight in the interstellar medium (ism)contains important clues about the size and composition of interstellar dust.while the ultraviolet (uv) and visible interstellar extinction is well studiedand can be closely fitted in terms of various dust mixtures (e.g., thesilicategraphite mixture), the infrared (ir) extinction is not well understood,particularly, the mid-ir extinction in the 3-8 micron wavelength range israther flat (or "gray") and is inconsistent with the standard mathis, rumpl, &amp;nordsieck (mrn) silicate-graphite dust model. we attempt to reproduce the flatir extinction by exploring various dust sizes and species, including amorphoussilicate, graphite, amorphous carbon and iron. we find that the flat irextinction is best explained in terms of micrometer-sized amorphous carbon dustwhich consumes ~ 60 carbon atoms per million hydrogen atoms (i.e., c/h ~ 60ppm). to account for the observed uv/visible and near-ir extinction, thesilicate-graphite model requires si/h ~ 34 ppm and c/h ~ 292 ppm. we concludethat the extinction from the uv to the mid-ir could be closely reproduced by amixture of submicrometer-sized amorphous silicate dust, submicrometer-sizedgraphitic dust, and micrometer-sized amorphous carbon dust, at the expense ofexcess c available in the ism (i.e., this model requires a solid-phase cabundance of c/h ~ 352 ppm, considerably exceeding what could be available inthe ism).

1507.06599	probing the role of carbon in the interstellar ultraviolet extinction	we probe the role of carbon in the ultraviolet (uv) extinction by examiningthe relations between the amount of carbon required to be locked up in dust[c/h]_dust with the 2175 angstrom extinction bump and the far-uv extinctionrise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 16 galacticsightlines for which the gas-phase carbon abundance is known and the 2175angstrom extinction bump exhibits variable strengths and widths.  we derive [c/h]_dust from the kramers-kronig relation which relates thewavelength-integrated extinction to the total dust volume. this approach isless model-dependent since it does not require the knowledge of the detailedoptical properties and size distribution of the dust. we also derive [c/h]_dustfrom fitting the observed uv/optical/near-infrared extinction with a mixture ofamorphous silicate and graphite.  we find that the carbon depletion [c/h]_dust tends to correlate with thestrength of the 2175 angstrom bump, while the abundance of silicon depleted indust shows no correlation with the 2175 angstrom bump. this supports graphiteor polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules as the possible carrier ofthe 2175 angstrom bump. we also see that [c/h]_dust shows a trend ofcorrelating with 1/r_v, where r_v is the total-to-selective extinction ratio,suggesting that the far-uv extinction is more likely produced by small carbondust than by small silicate dust.

astro-ph;0503564	can fluffy dust alleviate the "subsolar" interstellar abundance problem?	what might be the most appropriate set of interstellar reference abundancesof chemical elements (both in gas and in dust) relative to hydrogen has been asubject of much discussion in the past decade. while historically the sun hasbeen taken as the reference standard, it has recently been suggested that theinterstellar abundances might be better represented by those of b stars(because of their young ages) which are just ~60--70% of the widely adoptedsolar values (``subsolar''). on the other hand, the most recent estimates ofthe solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of b stars. ifthe interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like b stars or thenewly-determined solar c,o values, there might be a lack of raw material toform the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. in literature it hasbeen argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have afluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbingand scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a perunit mass basis). however, we show in this work that, using the kramers-kronigrelation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. alikely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellarphotospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar materialfrom which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimationof the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from theincomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formationprocess.

astro-ph;0604336	resolving the dusty circumstellar structure of the enigmatic symbiotic  star ch cygni with the mmt adaptive optics system	we imaged the symbiotic star ch cyg and two psf calibration stars using theunique 6.5m mmt deformable secondary adaptive optics system. ourhigh-resolution (fwhm=0.3"), very high strehl (98%+-2%) mid-infrared (9.8 and11.7 um) images of ch cyg allow us to probe finer length scales than everbefore for this object. ch cyg is significantly extended compared to ourunresolved psf calibration stars (mu uma and alpha her) at 9.8 and 11.7 um. weestimated the size of the extension by convolving a number of simple gaussianmodels with the mu uma psf and determining which model provided the best fit tothe data. adopting the hipparcos distance for this object of 270 pc, we found anearly gaussian extension with a fwhm at 9.8 um of ~40.5+-2.7 au (0.15+-0.01")and a fwhm at 11.7 um of 45.9+-2.7 au (0.17+-0.01"). after subtracting out thegaussian component of the emission (convolved with our psf), we found a faint\~0.7" asymmetric extension which peaks in flux ~0.5" north of the stars. thisextension is roughly coincident with the northern knotlike feature seen in hstwfpc2 images obtained in 1999.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

astro-ph;0607669	the spectral energy distribution of dust emission in the edge-on spiral  galaxy ngc 4631 as seen with spitzer and jcmt	we explore the nature of variations in dust emission within an individualgalaxy using 3.6 - 160 micron spitzer space telescope observations and 450 and850 micron james clerk maxwell telescope observations of the edge-on sd spiralgalaxy ngc 4631 with the goals of understanding the relation between polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) and dust emission, studying the variations in thecolors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeteremission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to themid- and far-infrared data. pah emission at 8 micron is found to correlate bestwith hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relationbreaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because ofdifferences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the pahs andheat the dust and possibly because the pahs are destroyed by the hard radiationfields in the centers of some star formation regions. the ratio of 8 micron pahemission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius.the 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant eventhough the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, whichsuggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiationfield. globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to whatwould be predicted by dust models. the 850 micron excess is highest in regionswith low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statisticalsignificance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. we rule outvariable emissivity functions or ~4 k dust as the possible origins of this 850micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that couldproduce the emission.

astro-ph;0608003	infrared emission from interstellar dust. iv. the silicate-graphite-pah  model in the post-spitzer era	infrared (ir) emission spectra are calculated for dust composed of mixturesof amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts ofpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) particles. the models are constrained toreproduce the average milky way extinction curve. the calculations include theeffects of single-photon heating. updated ir absorption properties for the pahsare presented, that are consistent with observed emission spectra, includingthose newly obtained by spitzer space telescope. we find a size distributionfor the pahs that results in emission band ratios consistent with observedspectra of the milky way and other galaxies. emission spectra are presented forvarious intensities of the illuminating starlight. we calculate how theefficiency of emission into different ir bands depends on pah size; the strong7.7um emission feature is produced mainly by pah particles containing &lt;1000 catoms. we show how the emission spectrum depends on u, the starlight intensityrelative to the local interstellar radiation field. the submm and far-infraredemission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellarmedium. using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emissionspectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such asoccurs within galaxies. the models are parameterized by the pah mass fractionqpah, the lower cutoff umin, and the fraction gamma of the dust heated bystarlight with u&gt;umin. we present graphical procedures using irac and mipsphotometry to estimate qpah, umin, and gamma, the fraction f_pdr of the dustluminosity coming from photodissociation regions with u&gt;100, and the total dustmass mdust.

astro-ph;0608561	the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud: s3mc imaging and  photometry in the mid- and far-infrared wavebands	we present the initial results from the spitzer survey of the smallmagellanic cloud (s3mc), which imaged the star-forming body of the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) in all seven mips and irac wavebands. we find that thef_8/f_24 ratio (an estimate of pah abundance) has large spatial variations andtakes a wide range of values that are unrelated to metallicity butanticorrelated with 24 um brightness and f_24/f_70 ratio. this suggests thatphotodestruction is primarily responsible for the low abundance of pahsobserved in star-forming low-metallicity galaxies. we use the s3mc images tocompile a photometric catalog of ~400,000 mid- and far-infrared point sourcesin the smc. the sources detected at the longest wavelengths fall into four maincategories: 1) bright 5.8 um sources with very faint optical counterparts andvery red mid-infrared colors ([5.8]-[8.0]&gt;1.2), which we identify as ysos. 2)bright mid-infrared sources with mildly red colors (0.16&lt;[5.8]-[8.0]&lt;0.6),identified as carbon stars. 3) bright mid-infrared sources with neutral colorsand bright optical counterparts, corresponding to oxygen-rich evolved stars.and, 4) unreddened early b stars (b3 to o9) with a large 24 um excess. thisexcess is reminiscent of debris disks, and is detected in only a small fractionof these stars (&lt;5%). the majority of the brightest infrared point sources inthe smc fall into groups one to three. we use this photometric information toproduce a catalog of 282 bright ysos in the smc with a very low level ofcontamination (~7%).

0811.1867	probing cosmic dust of the early universe through high-redshift  gamma-ray bursts	we explore the extinction properties of the dust in the distant universethrough the afterglows of high-redshifted grbs based on the "drude" modelwhich, unlike previous studies, does not require a prior assumption of templateextinction laws. we select grb070802 at z~2.45 (which shows clear evidence forthe 2175\aa extinction bump) and grb050904 at z~6.29, the 2nd most distant grbobserved to date. we fit their afterglow spectra to determine the extinction oftheir host galaxies. we find that (1) their extinction curves differsubstantially from that of the milky way, the small and large magellanic clouds(which were widely adopted as template extinction laws in literature); (2) the2175\aa extinction feature appears to be also present in grb050904 at z~6.29;and (3) there does not appear to show strong evidence for a dependence of dustextinction on redshifts. the inferred extinction curves are closely reproducedin terms of a mixture of amorphous silicate and graphite, both of which areexpected supernova condensates and have been identified in primitive meteoritesas presolar grains originating from supernovae (which are considered as themain source of dust at high-z).
