0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0903.3971	astronomical software wants to be free: a manifesto	astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members ofour community. purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasksbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.however, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards arenot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing softwarepublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead tosignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. weidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety ofapproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality ofastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providingbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by openaccess to large survey and simulation datasets. our aim is to open aconversation on how to move forward. we advocate that: (1) the astronomicalcommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facilityconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered asintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication anddata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing andcollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) thatwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and relatedpublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways offunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink ourvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just atechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0907.1903	groups of galaxies in aegis: the 200 ksec chandra extended x-ray source  catalogue	we present the discovery of seven x-ray emitting groups of galaxies selectedas extended x-ray sources in the 200 ksec chandra coverage of theall-wavelength extended groth strip international survey (aegis). in addition,we report on agn activity associated to these systems. using the deep2 galaxyredshift survey coverage, we identify optical counterparts and determinevelocity dispersions. in particular, we find three massive high-redshift groupsat z&gt;0.7, one of which is at z=1.13, the first x-ray detections ofspectroscopically selected deep2 groups. we also present a first look at thethe l_x-t, l_x-sigma, and sigma-t scaling relations for high-redshift massivegroups. we find that the properties of these x-ray selected systems agree wellwith the scaling relations of similar systems at low redshift, although thereare x-ray undetected groups in the deep2 catalogue with similar velocitydispersions. the other three x-ray groups with identified redshifts areassociated with lower mass groups at z~0.07 and together form part of a largestructure or "supergroup" in the southern portion of the aegis field. all ofthe low-redshift systems are centred on massive elliptical galaxies, and all ofthe high-redshift groups have likely central galaxies or galaxy pairs. all ofthe central group galaxies host x-ray point sources, radio sources, and/or showoptical agn emission. particularly interesting examples of central agn activityinclude a bent-double radio source plus x-ray point source at the center of agroup at z=0.74, extended radio and double x-ray point sources associated tothe central galaxy in the lowest-redshift group at z=0.066, and a bright greenvalley galaxy (part of a pair) in the z=1.13 group which shows optical agnemission lines.

(2009; w09), but extends to lowerredshifts and has specific star formation rates which are lower by ~0.6 dex. weidentify outflows of cool gas from the doppler shift of the mgii absorptionlines and find that the equivalent width (ew) of absorption due to outflowinggas increases on average with m_* and star formation rate (sfr). we attributethe large ews measured in spectra of the more massive, higher-sfr galaxies tooptically thick absorbing clouds having large velocity widths. the outflowshave hydrogen column densities n(h) &gt; 10^19.3 cm^-2, and extend to velocitiesof ~500 km/s. while galaxies with sfr &gt; 10 msun/yr host strong outflows in boththis and the w09 sample, we do not detect outflows in lower-sfr (i.e., logm_*/msun &lt; 10.5) galaxies at lower redshifts. using a simple galaxy evolutionmodel which assumes exponentially declining sfrs, we infer that strong outflowspersist in galaxies with log m_*/msun &gt; 10.5 as they age between z=1.4 and z~1,presumably because of their high absolute sfrs. finally, using high resolutionhst/acs imaging in tandem with our spectral analysis, we find evidence for aweak trend (at 1 sigma significance) of increasing outflow absorption strengthwith increasing galaxy sfr surface density.

1001.3411	parallel hop: a scalable halo finder for massive cosmological data sets	modern n-body cosmological simulations contain billions ($10^9$) of darkmatter particles. these simulations require hundreds to thousands of gigabytesof memory, and employ hundreds to tens of thousands of processing cores on manycompute nodes. in order to study the distribution of dark matter in acosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halofinder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in thesimulation. the resources required for halo finding are similar to therequirements for the simulation itself. in particular, simulations have becometoo extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that thecomputational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiplenodes and cores. here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method calledparallel hop for large-scale cosmological simulation data. based on the halofinder hop, it utilizes mpi and domain decomposition to distribute the halofinding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of muchlarger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallelimplementations of hop. we provide a reference implementation of this method asa part of the toolkit yt, an analysis toolkit for adaptive mesh refinement(amr) data that includes complementary analysis modules. additionally, wediscuss a suite of benchmarks that demonstrate that this method scales well upto several hundred tasks and datasets in excess of $2000^3$ particles. theparallel hop method and our implementation can be readily applied to any kindof n-body simulation data and is therefore widely applicable.

1001.4560	where do wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers occur? a study of the  environments of close galaxy pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey	we study the environment of wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers at 0.75 &lt; z &lt;1.2 using close pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that thetypical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that ofwet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. while the galaxycompanion rate (nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using n-bodysimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually mergedecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are morecommon in dense environments. after taking into account the merger probabilityof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environmentdependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshiftrange we have probed. on the other hand, the fractional dry merger rateincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of redgalaxies in dense environments. we also find that the environment distributionof k+a galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixedmergers, suggesting a possible connection between k+a galaxies and wet and/orwet+mixed mergers. we conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regionsare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-dayred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their massaccretion in the last 8 billion years. our findings suggest that dry mergersare crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

1002.3598	the spatial clustering of rosat all-sky survey agn: i. the  cross-correlation function with sdss luminous red galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of ~1550 broad-line active galacticnuclei (agns) at &lt;z&gt;=0.25 detected in the rosat all-sky survey (rass) throughtheir measured cross-correlation function with ~46,000 luminous red galaxies(lrgs) in the sloan digital sky survey. by measuring the cross-correlation ofour agn sample with a larger tracer set of lrgs, we both minimize shot noiseerrors due to the relatively small agn sample size and avoid systematic errorsdue to the spatially varying galactic absorption that would affect directmeasurements of the auto-correlation function (acf) of the agn sample.  the measured acf correlation length for the total rass-agn sample(&lt;l_(0.1-2.4 kev)&gt;=1.5 x 10^(44) erg/s) is r_0=4.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5} h^(-1) mpc andthe slope \gamma=1.7^{+0.1}_{-0.1}. splitting the sample into low and high l_xsamples at l_(0.5-10 kev)=10^(44) erg/s, we detect an x-ray luminositydependence of the clustering amplitude at the ~2.5 \sigma level. the low l_xsample has r_0=3.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8} h^(-1) mpc (\gamma=1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.3}), whichis similar to the correlation length of blue star-forming galaxies at lowredshift. the high l_x sample has r_0=5.4^{+0.7}_{-1.0} h^(-1) mpc(\gamma=1.9^{+0.2}_{-0.2}), which is consistent with the clustering of redgalaxies. from the observed clustering amplitude, we infer that the typicaldark matter halo (dmh) mass harboring rass-agn with broad optical emissionlines is log (m_dmh/(h^(-1) m_sun)) =12.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}, 11.8^{+0.6}_{-\infty},13.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4} for the total, low l_x, and high l_x rass-agn samples,respectively.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1012.1324	primus: enhanced specific star formation rates in close galaxy pairs	tidal interactions between galaxies can trigger star formation, whichcontributes to the global star formation rate density of the universe and couldbe a factor in the transformation of blue, star-forming galaxies to red,quiescent galaxies over cosmic time. we investigate tidally-triggered starformation in isolated close galaxy pairs drawn from the prism multi-objectsurvey (primus), a low-dispersion prism redshift survey that has measured~120,000 robust galaxy redshifts over 9.1 deg^2 out to z ~ 1. we select asample of galaxies in isolated galaxy pairs at redshifts 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, withno other objects within a projected separation of 300 h^-1 kpc and dz/(1+z) =0.01, and compare them to a control sample of isolated galaxies to test forsystematic differences in their rest-frame fuv-r and nuv-r colors as a proxyfor relative specific sfr. we find that galaxies in r_p &lt; 50 h^-1 kpc pairshave bluer dust-corrected uv-r colors on average than the control galaxies by-0.134 +/- 0.045 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.075 +/- 0.038 magnitudes in nuv-r,corresponding to a ~15-20% increase in ssfr. this indicates an enhancement inssfr due to tidal interactions. we also find that this relative enhancement isgreater for a subset of r_p &lt; 30 h^-1 kpc pair galaxies, for which the averagecolors offsets are -0.193 +/- 0.065 magnitudes in fuv-r and -0.159 +/- 0.048magnitudes in nuv-r, corresponding to a ~25-30% increase in ssfr. we test forevolution in the enhancement of tidally-triggered star formation with redshiftacross our sample redshift range and find marginal evidence for a decrease inssfr enhancement from 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 to 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.75. this indicates that achange in enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions in lowdensity environments is not a contributor to the decline in the global starformation rate density across this redshift range.

1105.3880	autocorrelations of stellar light and mass at z~0 and ~1: from sdss to  deep2	we present measurements of projected autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) forthe stellar mass of galaxies and for their light in the u, b and v bands, usingdata from the third data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and thefinal data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we investigate theclustering bias of stellar mass and light by comparing these to projectedautocorrelations of dark matter estimated from the millennium simulations (ms)at z=1 and 0.07, the median redshifts of our galaxy samples. all of theautocorrelation and bias functions show systematic trends with spatial scaleand waveband which are impressively similar at the two redshifts. this showsthat the well-established environmental dependence of stellar populations inthe local universe is already in place at z=1. the recent ms-based galaxyformation simulation of guo et al. (2011) reproduces the scale-dependentclustering of luminosity to an accuracy better than 30% in all bands and atboth redshifts, but substantially overpredicts mass autocorrelations atseparations below about 2 mpc. further comparison of the shapes of our stellarmass bias functions with those predicted by the model suggests that both thesdss and deep2 data prefer a fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 0.8 rather thanthe sigma_8=0.9 assumed by the ms.

1107.4368	primus: the dependence of agn accretion on host stellar mass and color	we present evidence that the incidence of active galactic nuclei (agns) andthe distribution of their accretion rates do not depend on the stellar massesof their host galaxies, contrary to previous studies. we use hard (2-10 kev)x-ray data from three extragalactic fields (xmm-lss, cosmos and elais-s1) withredshifts from the prism multi-object survey to identify 242 agns with l_{2-10kev}=10^{42-44} erg /s within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0over ~3.4 deg^2 and to i~23. we find that although the fraction of galaxieshosting an agn at fixed x-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, thedistribution of x-ray luminosities is independent of mass. furthermore, we showthat the probability that a galaxy will host an agn can be defined by auniversal eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxystellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. these resultsdemonstrate that agns are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5&lt;logm_*/m_sun&lt;12 and that the same physical processes regulate agn activity in allgalaxies in this stellar mass range. while a higher agn fraction may beobserved in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to theunderlying eddington ratio distribution. we also find that the agn fractiondrops rapidly between z~1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced(factor~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. consequently, whileagn activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do notfind evidence that the presence of an agn is related to the quenching of starformation or the color transformation of galaxies.

1108.2503	calibrating the star formation rate at z=1 from optical data	we present a star-formation rate calibration based on optical data that isconsistent with average observed rates in both the red and blue galaxypopulations at z~1. the motivation for this study is to calculate sfrs fordeep2 redshift survey galaxies in the 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift range, but our resultsare generally applicable to similar optically-selected galaxy samples withoutrequiring uv or ir data. using sfrs fit from uv/optical seds in the aegissurvey, we explore the behavior of restframe b-band magnitude, observed [oii]luminosity, and restframe (u-b) color with sed-fit sfr for both red sequenceand blue cloud galaxies. we find that a sfr calibration can be calculated forall z~1 deep2 galaxies using a simultaneous fit in m_b and restframe colorswith residual errors that are within the sfr measurement error. the resultingsfr calibration produces fit residual errors of 0.3 dex rms scatter for thefull color-independent sample with minimal correlated residual error in l[oii]or stellar mass. we then compare the calibrated z~1 sfrs to two diagnosticsthat use l[oii] as a tracer in local galaxies and correct for dust extinctionat intermediate redshifts through either galaxy b-band luminosity or stellarmass. we find that a l[oii] - m_b sfr calibration commonly used in theliterature agrees well with our calculated sfrs after correcting for theaverage b-band luminosity evolution in l* galaxies. however, we find betteragreement with a local l[oii]-based sfr calibration that includes stellar massto correct for reddening effects, indicating that stellar mass is a bettertracer of dust extinction for all galaxy types and less affected by systematicevolution than galaxy luminosity from z=1 to the current epoch.

1110.5648	the spatial clustering of rosat all-sky survey agns iii. expanded sample  and comparison with optical agns	this is the third paper in a series that reports on our investigation of theclustering properties of agns identified in the rosat all-sky survey (rass) andsloan digital sky survey (sdss). in this paper, we extend the redshift range to0.07&lt;z&lt;0.50 and measure the clustering amplitudes of both x-ray andoptically-selected sdss broad-line agns with and without radio detections aswell as for x-ray selected narrow-line rass/sdss agns. we measure theclustering amplitude through cross-correlation functions (ccfs) with sdssgalaxies and derive the bias by applying a halo occupation distribution (hod)model directly to the ccfs. we find no statistically convincing difference inthe clustering of x-ray and optically-selected broad-line agns, as well as withsamples in which radio-detected agns are excluded. this is in contrast to lowredshift optically-selected narrow-line agns, where radio-loud agns are foundin more massive halos than optical agns without a radio-detection. the typicaldark matter halo masses of our broad-line agns are log m_dmh/[h^(-1) m_sun] ~12.4-13.4, consistent with the halo mass range of typical non-agn galaxies atlow redshifts. we find no significant difference between the clustering ofx-ray selected narrow-line agns and broad-line agns. we confirm the weakdependence of the clustering strength on agn x-ray luminosity at a ~2 sigmalevel. finally, we summarize the current picture of agn clustering to z~1.5based on three dimensional clustering measurements.

1202.6633	large scale structure of the universe	galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space. on large scales the universedisplays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters onscales of ~1-3 mpc/h, which lie at the intersections of long filaments ofgalaxies that are &gt;10 mpc/h in length. vast regions of relatively empty space,known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between thesestructures. this observed large scale structure depends both on cosmologicalparameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. using the two-pointcorrelation function, one can trace the dependence of large scale structure ongalaxy properties such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track itsevolution with redshift. comparison of the observed galaxy clusteringsignatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand theclustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parentdark matter halos. clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matterhalo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations atdifferent epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolutionmodels. this chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-pointcorrelation function in both redshift and real space, presents the currentresults of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties,and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids andfilaments. the interpretation of these results with current theoretical modelsis also presented.

(2005). in the optimization effort, we have taken particular careto ensure that the mock catalogs resemble the data as closely as possible, andwe have fine-tuned our methods separately on mocks constructed for the egs andthe rest of deep2. we have also probed the effect of the assumed cosmology onour inferred group-finding efficiency by performing our optimization on threedifferent mock catalogs with different background cosmologies, finding largedifferences in the group-finding success we can achieve for these differentmocks. using the mock catalog whose background cosmology is most consistentwith current data, we estimate that the deep2 group catalog is 72% complete and61% pure (74% and 67% for the egs) and that the group-finder correctlyclassifies 70% of galaxies that truly belong to groups, with an additional 46%of interloper galaxies contaminating the catalog (66% and 43% for the egs).(abridged)

1207.2214	improved mock galaxy catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey from  subhalo abundance and environment matching	we develop empirical methods for modeling the galaxy population andpopulating cosmological n-body simulations with mock galaxies according to theobserved properties of galaxies in survey data. we use these techniques toproduce a new set of mock catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey basedon the output of the high-resolution bolshoi simulation, as well as two othersimulations with different cosmological parameters, all of which we release forpublic use. the mock-catalog creation technique uses subhalo abundance matchingto assign galaxy luminosities to simulated dark-matter halos. it then addscolor information to the resulting mock galaxies in a manner that depends onthe local galaxy density, in order to reproduce the measured color-environmentrelation in the data. in the course of constructing the catalogs, we testvarious models for including scatter in the relation between halo mass andgalaxy luminosity, within the abundance-matching framework. we find that thereis no constant-scatter model that can simultaneously reproduce both theluminosity function and the autocorrelation function of deep2. this result hasimplications for galaxy-formation theory, and it restricts the range ofcontexts in which the mocks can be usefully applied. nevertheless, carefulcomparisons show that our new mocks accurately reproduce a wide range of theother properties of the deep2 catalog, suggesting that they can be used to gaina detailed understanding of various selection effects in deep2.

1210.6694	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering dependence on galaxy  stellar mass and star formation rate at z~1	we present deep2 galaxy clustering measurements at z~1 as a function ofstellar mass, star formation rate (sfr), and specific sfr (ssfr). we find astrong positive correlation between stellar mass and clustering amplitude on1-10 h^-1 mpc scales for blue, star-forming galaxies with 9.5 &lt; log(m_*/m_sun)&lt; 11 and no dependence for red, quiescent galaxies with 10.5 &lt; log(m_*/m_sun) &lt;11.5. using recently re-calibrated deep2 sfrs from restframe b-band magnitudeand optical colors, we find that within the blue galaxy population at z~1, theclustering amplitude increases strongly with increasing sfr and decreasingssfr. for red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clusteringamplitude and either sfr or ssfr. blue galaxies with high sfr or low ssfr areas clustered on large scales as red galaxies. we find that the clustering trendobserved with sfr can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlationbetween stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. we also showthat galaxies above the star-forming "main sequence" are less clustered thangalaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass. these results arenot consistent with the high ssfr population being dominated by major mergers.we also measure the clustering amplitude of our samples on small scales (&lt; 0.3h^-1 mpc) and find an enhanced clustering signal relative to the best-fitlarge-scale power law for red galaxies with high stellar mass, blue galaxieswith high sfr, and both red and blue galaxies with high ssfr. the increasedsmall-scale clustering for galaxies with high ssfrs is likely linked totriggered star formation in interacting galaxies. these measurements providestrong constraints on galaxy evolution and halo occupation distribution modelsat z~1.

1301.1689	primus: an observationally motivated model to connect the evolution of  the agn and galaxy populations out to z~1	we present an observationally motivated model to connect the agn and galaxypopulations at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 and predict the agn x-ray luminosity function (xlf).we start with measurements of the stellar mass function of galaxies (from theprism multi-object survey) and populate galaxies with agns using models for theprobability of a galaxy hosting an agn as a function of specific accretionrate. our model is based on measurements indicating that the specific accretionrate distribution is a universal function across a wide range of host stellarmass with slope gamma_1 = -0.65 and an overall normalization that evolves withredshift. we test several simple assumptions to extend this model to highspecific accretion rates (beyond the measurements) and compare the predictionsfor the xlf with the observed data. we find good agreement with a model thatallows for a break in the specific accretion rate distribution at a pointcorresponding to the eddington limit, a steep power-law tail to super-eddingtonratios with slope gamma_2 = -2.1 +0.3 -0.5, and a scatter of 0.38 dex in thescaling between black hole and host stellar mass. our results show that samplesof low luminosity agns are dominated by moderately massive galaxies (m* ~10^{10-11} m_sun) growing with a wide range of accretion rates due to the shapeof the galaxy stellar mass function rather than a preference for agn activityat a particular stellar mass. luminous agns may be a severely skewed populationwith elevated black hole masses relative to their host galaxies and in rarephases of rapid accretion.

1408.2521	the mosdef survey: mass, metallicity, and star-formation rate at z~2.3	we present results on the z~2.3 mass-metallicity relation (mzr) using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. we use aninitial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage ofh\beta, [oiii]\lambda 5007, h\alpha, and [nii]\lambda 6584 rest-frame opticalemission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the n2 ando3n2 strong-line indicators. we find a positive correlation between stellarmass and metallicity among individual z~2.3 galaxies using both the n2 and o3n2indicators. we also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygenabundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. among compositespectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellarmass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local mzr. when the sample is divided atthe median star-formation rate (sfr), we do not observe significant sfrdependence of the z~2.3 mzr among either individual galaxies or compositespectra. we furthermore find that z~2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dexlower at a given stellar mass and sfr than is observed locally. this offsetsuggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamentalmetallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and sfr, and may provideevidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up dueto inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. however,robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshiftgalaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locallycalibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.

1409.6522	the mosdef survey: optical agn diagnostics at z~2.3	we present results from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey onrest-frame optical agn identification and completeness at z~2.3. with oursample of 50 galaxies and 10 x-ray and ir-selected agn with measured h-beta,[oiii], h-alpha, and [nii] emission lines, we investigate the location of agnin the bpt, mex (mass-excitation), and cex (color-excitation) diagrams. we findthat the bpt diagram works well to identify agn at z~2.3 and that the z~0agn/star-forming galaxy classifications do not need to shift substantially atz~2.3 to robustly separate these populations. however, the mex diagram fails toidentify all of the agn identified in the bpt diagram, and the cex diagram issubstantially contaminated at high redshift. we further show that agn samplesselected using the bpt diagram have selection biases in terms of both hoststellar mass and stellar population, in that agn in low mass and/or highspecific star formation rate galaxies are difficult to identify using the bptdiagram. these selection biases become increasingly severe at high redshift,such that optically-selected agn samples at high redshift will necessarily beincomplete. we also find that the gas in the narrow-line region appears to bemore enriched than gas in the host galaxy for at least some mosdef agn.however, agn at z~2 are generally less enriched than local agn with the samehost stellar mass.

1409.7071	the mosdef survey: excitation properties of $z\sim 2.3$ star-forming  galaxies	we present results on the excitation properties of z~2.3 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. with itscoverage of the full suite of strong rest-frame optical emission lines, mosdefprovides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of arepresentative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. we investigate thelocations of z~2.3 mosdef galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnosticdiagrams. these include the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha and [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/ha"bpt" diagrams, as well as the o_32 vs. r_23 excitation diagram. we recover thewell-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the[oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bpt diagram relative to sdss star-forming galaxies.however, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is lesssignificant than for rest-frame-uv selected and emission-line selected galaxiesat z~2. furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearingwithin the low-mass half of the z~2.3 mosdef sample, where galaxies are shiftedtowards higher [nii]/ha at fixed [oiii]/hb. within the [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/haand o_32 vs. r_23 diagrams, we find that z~2.3 galaxies are distributed likelocal ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bptdiagram to elevated n/o abundance ratios among lower-mass (m_*&lt;10^10 m_sun)high-redshift galaxies. the variation in n/o ratios calls into question the useat high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, butthe apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the o_32vs. r_23 diagram paves the way for using the combination of o_32 and r_23 as anunbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. this indicatorwill allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization ofthe mass-metallicity relationship over more than 10 gyr.

1412.1835	the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey: rest-frame optical  spectroscopy for ~1500 h-selected galaxies at 1.37 &lt; z &lt; 3.8	in this paper we present the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey.the mosdef survey aims to obtain moderate-resolution (r=3000-3650) rest-frameoptical spectra (~3700-7000 angstrom) for ~1500 galaxies at 1.37&lt;z&lt;3.80 inthree well-studied candels fields: aegis, cosmos, and goods-n. targets areselected in three redshift intervals: 1.37&lt;z&lt;1.70, 2.09&lt;z&lt;2.61, and2.95&lt;z&lt;3.80, down to fixed h_ab (f160w) magnitudes of 24.0, 24.5 and 25.0,respectively, using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs from the 3d-hstsurvey. we target both strong nebular emission lines (e.g., [oii], hbeta,[oiii], 5008, halpha, [nii], and [sii]) and stellar continuum and absorptionfeatures (e.g., balmer lines, ca-ii h and k, mgb, 4000 angstrom break). here wepresent an overview of our survey, the observational strategy, the datareduction and analysis, and the sample characteristics based on spectraobtained during the first 24 nights. to date, we have completed 21 masks,obtaining spectra for 591 galaxies. for ~80% of the targets we derive a robustredshift from either emission or absorption lines. in addition, we confirm 55additional galaxies, which were serendipitously detected. the mosdef galaxysample includes unobscured star-forming, dusty star-forming, and quiescentgalaxies and spans a wide range in stellar mass (~10^9-10^11.5 msol) and starformation rate (~10^0-10^3 msol/yr). the spectroscopically confirmed sample isroughly representative of an h-band limited galaxy sample at these redshifts.with its large sample size, broad diversity in galaxy properties, and wealth ofavailable ancillary data, mosdef will transform our understanding of thestellar, gaseous, metal, dust, and black hole content of galaxies during thetime when the universe was most active.

1412.7162	primus: effect of galaxy environment on the quiescent fraction evolution  at z &lt; 0.8	we investigate the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of thequiescent fraction ($f_\mathrm{q}$) from z =0.8 to 0.0 using spectroscopicredshifts and multi-wavelength imaging data from the prism multi-object survey(primus) and the sloan digitial sky survey (sdss). our stellar mass limitedgalaxy sample consists of ~14,000 primus galaxies within z = 0.2-0.8 and~64,000 sdss galaxies within z = 0.05-0.12. we classify the galaxies asquiescent or star-forming based on an evolving specific star formation cut, andas low or high density environments based on fixed cylindrical apertureenvironment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining population.for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in low or high density environments, weexamine the evolution of their stellar mass function (smf). then using the smfswe compute $f_\mathrm{q}(m_{*})$ and quantify its evolution within our redshiftrange. we find that the quiescent fraction is higher at higher masses and indenser environments. the quiescent fraction rises with cosmic time for allmasses and environments. at a fiducial mass of $10^{10.5}m_\odot$, from z~0.7to 0.1, the quiescent fraction rises by 15% at the lowest environments and by25% at the highest environments we measure. these results suggest that for aminority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to externalinfluences on them. however, in the recent universe a substantial fraction ofthe galaxies that cease forming stars do so due to internal processes.

1502.01348	primus: the effect of physical scale on the luminosity-dependence of  galaxy clustering via cross-correlations	we report small-scale clustering measurements from the primus spectroscopicredshift survey as a function of color and luminosity. we measure thereal-space cross-correlations between 62,106 primary galaxies with primusredshifts and a tracer population of 545,000 photometric galaxies overredshifts from z=0.2 to z=1. we separately fit a power-law model in redshiftand luminosity to each of three independent color-selected samples of galaxies.we report clustering amplitudes at fiducial values of z=0.5 and l=1.5 l*. theclustering of the red galaxies is ~3 times as strong as that of the bluegalaxies and ~1.5 as strong as that of the green galaxies. we also find thatthe luminosity dependence of the clustering is strongly dependent on physicalscale, with greater luminosity dependence being found between r=0.0625 mpc/hand r=0.25 mpc/h, compared to the r=0.5 mpc/h to r=2 mpc/h range. moreover,over a range of two orders of magnitude in luminosity, a single power-law fitto the luminosity dependence is not sufficient to explain the increase inclustering at both the bright and faint ends at the smaller scales. we arguethat luminosity-dependent clustering at small scales is a necessary componentof galaxy-halo occupation models for blue, star-forming galaxies as well as forred, quenched galaxies.

1503.00731	dark matter halo models of stellar mass-dependent galaxy clustering in  primus+deep2 at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2	we utilize $\lambda$cdm halo occupation models of galaxy clustering toinvestigate the evolving stellar mass dependent clustering of galaxies in theprism multi-object survey (primus) and deep2 redshift survey over the pasteight billion years of cosmic time, between $0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2$. these clusteringmeasurements provide new constraints on the connections between dark matterhalo properties and galaxy properties in the context of the evolvinglarge-scale structure of the universe. using both an analytic model and a setof mock galaxy catalogs, we find a strong correlation between central galaxystellar mass and dark matter halo mass over the range$m_\mathrm{halo}\sim10^{11}$-$10^{13}~h^{-1}m_\odot$, approximately consistentwith previous observations and theoretical predictions. however, thestellar-to-halo mass relation (shmr) and the mass scale where star formationefficiency reaches a maximum appear to evolve more strongly than predicted byother models, including models based primarily on abundance-matchingconstraints. we find that the fraction of satellite galaxies in haloes of agiven mass decreases significantly from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.9$, partly due tothe fact that haloes at fixed mass are rarer at higher redshift and have lowerabundances. we also find that the $m_1/m_\mathrm{min}$ ratio, a model parameterthat quantifies the critical mass above which haloes host at least onesatellite, decreases from $\approx20$ at $z\sim0$ to $\approx13$ at $z\sim0.9$.considering the evolution of the subhalo mass function vis-\`{a}-vis satelliteabundances, this trend has implications for relations between satellitegalaxies and halo substructures and for intracluster mass, which we argue hasgrown due to stripped and disrupted satellites between $z\sim0.9$ and$z\sim0.5$.

1503.01120	the evolution of the x-ray luminosity functions of unabsorbed and  absorbed agns out to z~5	we present new measurements of the evolution of the x-ray luminosityfunctions (xlfs) of unabsorbed and absorbed active galactic nuclei (agns) outto z~5. we construct samples containing 2957 sources detected at hard (2-7 kev)x-ray energies and 4351 sources detected at soft (0.5-2 kev) energies from acompilation of chandra surveys supplemented by wide-area surveys from asca} androsat. we consider the hard and soft x-ray samples separately and find that thexlf based on either (initially neglecting absorption effects) is best describedby a new flexible model parametrization where the break luminosity,normalization and faint-end slope all evolve with redshift. we then incorporateabsorption effects, separately modelling the evolution of the xlfs ofunabsorbed ($20&lt;\log n_\mathrm{h}&lt;22$) and absorbed ($22&lt;\log n_\mathrm{h}&lt;24$)agns, seeking a model that can reconcile both the hard- and soft-band samples.we find that the absorbed agn xlf has a lower break luminosity, a highernormalization, and a steeper faint-end slope than the unabsorbed agn xlf out toz~2. hence, absorbed agns dominate at low luminosities, with the absorbedfraction falling rapidly as luminosity increases. both xlfs undergo strongluminosity evolution which shifts the transition in the absorbed fraction tohigher luminosities at higher redshifts. the evolution in the shape of thetotal xlf is primarily driven by the changing mix of unabsorbed and absorbedpopulations.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

1504.02782	the mosdef survey: measurements of balmer decrements and the dust  attenuation curve at redshifts z~1.4-2.6	we present results on the dust attenuation curve of z~2 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. our sampleconsists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts inthe range z= 1.36-2.59 and high s/n measurements of, or upper limits on, theh-alpha and h-beta emission lines obtained with keck/mosfire. we constructcomposite seds of galaxies in bins of specific sfr and balmer optical depth inorder to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the uv throughnear-ir for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. our results implyan attenuation curve that is very similar to the smc extinction curve atwavelengths redward of 2500 angstroms. at shorter wavelengths, the shape of thecurve is identical to that of the calzetti relation, but with a lowernormalization (r_v). hence, the new attenuation curve results in sfrs that are~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtainedwith the calzetti attenuation curve. moreover, we find that the difference inthe reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellarcontinuum correlates strongly with sfr, such that for dust-corrected sfrslarger than 20 msun/yr assuming a chabrier imf, the nebular emission linessuffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. a simplemodel that can account for these trends is one in which the uv through opticalstellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, whilethe nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated bydustier stellar populations for galaxies with large sfrs, as a result of theincreased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. consequently, uv- andsed-based sfrs may underestimate the total sfr at even modest levels of ~20msun/yr.

astro-ph;0109131	measuring the cosmic equation of state with galaxy clusters in the deep2  redshift survey	the abundances of groups and clusters of galaxies are expected to havechanged substantially since high redshift, with the strength of this evolutiondependent upon fundamental cosmological parameters. upcoming large redshiftsurveys of distant galaxies will make it possible to measure these quantitiesat z~1; when combined with the results of local redshift surveys currentlyunderway, the evolution of cluster abundances may be determined. the deep2redshift survey, planned to begin in spring 2002, is particularly well-suitedfor this work because of the high spectroscopic resolution to be used; velocitydispersions of groups will be readily measurable. in this paper, we determinethe constraints on dark energy models that counts of deep2 clusters shouldprovide. we find that comparing cosmological models using the simultaneousdistribution of clusters in both velocity dispersion and redshift yieldssignificantly stronger constraints than the redshift distribution alone. themethod can be made more powerful by employing a value of the fluctuationamplitude sigma_8 determined with upcoming techniques (external to deep2) thathave no omega_m degeneracy. the equation-of-state parameter for dark energymodels, w=p/rho, can then be measured to ~0.1 from observations of clustersalone.

astro-ph;0112370	three-dimensional identification and reconstruction of galaxy systems  within deep redshift surveys	we have developed a new geometrical method for identifying and reconstructinga homogeneous and highly complete set of galaxy groups in the next generationof deep, flux-limited redshift surveys. our method combines information fromthe three-dimensional voronoi diagram and its dual, the delaunay triangulation,to obtain group and cluster catalogs that are remarkably robust over wideranges in redshift and degree of density enhancement. using the mock deep2catalogs, we demonstrate that the vdm algorithm can be used to identify ahomogeneous set of groups in a magnitude-limited sample ($i\sbr{ab}\le23.5$)throughout the survey redshift window $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$. the actual groupmembership can be effectively reconstructed even in the distorted redshiftspace environment for systems with line of sight velocity dispersion$\sigma_{los}$ greater than $\approx 200$ \kms. by comparing the galaxy clustercatalog derived from the mock deep2 observations to the underlying distributionof clusters found in real space with much fainter galaxies included (whichshould more closely trace mass in the cluster), we can assess completeness invelocity dispersion directly. we conclude that the recovered deep2 group andcluster sample should be statistically complete for $\sigma_{los} \gtrsim 400$\kms. finally, we argue that the reconstructed bivariate distribution ofsystems as a function of redshift and velocity dispersion reproduces with highfidelity the underlying real space distribution and can thus be used robustlyto constrain cosmological parameters

astro-ph;0305008	cosmological results from high-z supernovae	the high-z supernova search team has discovered and observed 8 new supernovaein the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. these independent observations, confirm theresult of riess et al. (1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0305587	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: spectral classification of galaxies at  z~1	we present a principal component analysis (pca)-based spectralclassification, eta, for the first 5600 galaxies observed in the deep2 redshiftsurvey. this parameter provides a very pronounced separation between absorptionand emission dominated galaxy spectra - corresponding to passively evolving andactively star-forming galaxies in the survey respectively. in addition it isshown that despite the high resolution of the observed spectra, this parameteralone can be used to quite accurately reconstruct any given galaxy spectrum,suggesting there are not many `degrees of freedom' in the observed spectra ofthis galaxy population. it is argued that this form of classification, eta,will be particularly valuable in making future comparisons between high andlow-redshift galaxy surveys for which very large spectroscopic samples are nowreadily available, particularly when used in conjunction with high-resolutionspectral synthesis models which will be made public in the near future. we alsodiscuss the relative advantages of this approach to distant galaxyclassification compared to other methods such as colors and morphologies.finally, we compare the classification derived here with that adopted for the2df galaxy redshift survey and in so doing show that the two systems are verysimilar. this will be particularly useful in subsequent analyses when makingcomparisons between results from each of these surveys to study evolution inthe galaxy populations and large-scale structure.

astro-ph;0603177	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the relationship between galaxy  properties and environment at z ~ 1	we study the mean environment of galaxies in the deep2 galaxy redshift surveyas a function of rest-frame color, luminosity, and [oii] equivalent width. thelocal galaxy overdensity for &gt;14,000 galaxies at 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.35 is estimatedusing the projected 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density. of the galaxyproperties studied, mean environment is found to depend most strongly on galaxycolor; all major features of the correlation between mean overdensity andrest-frame color observed in the local universe were already in place at z ~ 1.in contrast to local results, we find a substantial slope in the meandependence of environment on luminosity for blue, star-forming galaxies at z ~1, with brighter blue galaxies being found on average in regions of greateroverdensity. we discuss the roles of galaxy clusters and groups in establishingthe observed correlations between environment and galaxy properties at highredshift, and we also explore the evidence for a ``downsizing of quenching''from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results add weight to existing evidence that themechanism(s) that result in star-formation quenching are efficient in groupenvironments as well as clusters. this work is the first of its kind at highredshift and represents the first in a series of papers addressing the role ofenvironment in galaxy formation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0607272	aegis: enhancement of dust-enshrouded star formation in close galaxy  pairs and merging galaxies up to z ~ 1	using data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and hst/acs imaging in theextended groth strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems includingkinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. spitzermips 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formationactivity, and at a fixed stellar mass (m_{*}) the median infrared luminosity(l_{ir}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. enhancementdeclines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers andweaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. at z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%of massive interacting galaxies (m_{*} &gt; 2*10^{10} m_{solar}) are found to beulirgs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. the large spread of irluminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that thisenhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentifiedfactors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presenceof agn or bar). the contribution of interacting systems to the total irluminosity density is moderate (&lt;= 36 %).

astro-ph;0607454	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering of quasars and galaxies at  z=1	we present the clustering of deep2 galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 around quasarsidentified using both the sdss and deep2 surveys. we measure the two-pointcross-correlation of a sample of 36 optically-selected,spectroscopically-identified quasars from the sdss and 16 more found in thedeep2 survey with the full deep2 galaxy sample over scales 0.1 &lt; r_p &lt; 10mpc/h. the clustering amplitude is found to be similar to the auto-correlationfunction of deep2 galaxies, with a relative bias of b=0.89 +/-0.24 betweenquasars and deep2 galaxies at z~1. no significant dependence is found on scale,quasar luminosity, or redshift over the ranges we probe here. the clusteringamplitude errors are comparable to those from significantly larger quasarsamples, such as the 2df qso redshift survey. this results from the statisticalpower of cross-correlation techniques, which exploit the fact that galaxies aremuch more numerous than quasars. we also measure the local environments ofquasars using the 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density of surrounding deep2galaxies. quasars are found in regions of similar mean overdensity as bluedeep2 galaxies; they differ in environment from the red deep2 galaxy populationat 2 sigma significance. our results imply that quasars do not reside inparticularly massive dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean darkmatter halo mass of m_200 ~ 3 10^12 solar masses in a concordance lcdmcosmology.

astro-ph;0607512	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: evolution of the color-density  relation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35	using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 1.35. we find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence dependsstrongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greatergalaxy density. at all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measuredoverdensity. the observed correlations between the red fraction and localoverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at agreater than 5-\sigma level. over the entire redshift regime studied, we findthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies morestrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequencecounterparts at high redshift. at z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weaklycorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to theclustering of ~ l* galaxies at that epoch must be small. our findings addweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequencehas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) atz &lt; 1.5. the strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-densityand color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms(i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') uponthe galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;0611792	the co-formation of spheroids and quasars traced in their clustering	we compare observed clustering of quasars and galaxies as a function ofredshift, mass, luminosity, &amp; color/morphology, to constrain models of quasarfueling and spheroid-bh co-evolution. high redshift quasars are shown to bedrawn from progenitors of local early-type galaxies, with the characteristicquasar luminosity l* reflecting a characteristic mass of 'active' bh/hostpopulations at each redshift. evolving observed high-z quasar clustering to z=0predicts a trend of clustering in 'quasar remnants' as a function of stellarmass identical to that observed for early-types. however, quasar clusteringdoes not simply reflect observed early (or late)-type populations; at eachredshift, quasars cluster as an 'intermediate' population. comparing with theage of elliptical stellar populations reveals that this 'intermediate'population represents those ellipticals undergoing or terminating their finalsignificant star formation at each epoch. assuming that quasar triggering isassociated with the formation/termination epoch of ellipticals predicts quasarclustering at all observed redshifts without any model dependence orassumptions about quasar light curves, lifetimes, or accretion rates. this isnot true for disks or quasar halos: i.e. quasars do not generically trace starformation, disks, or halo assembly. quasar clustering at all z is consistentwith a constant halo mass ~4x10^{12} m_sun, similar to local 'group scales.'the observations support a scenario in which major mergers trigger quasaractivity and dominate bright, high-z quasar populations. we show thatmeasurements of quasar clustering versus luminosity at z~1 can be used toconstrain different lower-luminosity agn fueling mechanisms, and that high-zclustering is sensitive to whether or not systems 'shut down' growth at z&gt;3.

astro-ph;0703457	galaxy evolution from halo occupation distribution modeling of deep2 and  sdss galaxy clustering	we model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function ofdeep2 (z~1) and sdss (z~0) galaxies within the halo occupation distribution(hod) framework. at both epochs, there is a tight correlation between centralgalaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing forlarger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higherluminosity. central l* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1than at z~0. we find little evolution in the relation between mass scales ofhost halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the sameluminosity threshold. combining these hod results with theoretical predictionsof the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection betweenthe galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies toz~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us tostudy the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. we find that thestellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. on average, the majorityof the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos(~5x10^11 msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in centralgalaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 msun/h) result from star formation betweenz~1 and z~0. in addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formationefficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.future work can combine hod modeling of the clustering of galaxies at differentredshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matterhalos. this can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to bothmergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerfultests of galaxy formation theories.

astro-ph;9705007	direct observations of the ionizing star in the uc hii region  g29.96-0.02: a strong constraint on the stellar birth line for massive stars	we have observed the ultracompact hii region g29.96-0.02 in the near infraredj, h, and k bands and in the br-gamma line. by comparison with radioobservations, we determine that the extinction to the nebula is ak = 2.14 witha 3 sigma uncertainty of 0.25. we identify the ionizing star and determine itsintrinsic k magnitude. the star does not have an infrared excess and so appearsto be no longer accreting. the k magnitude and the bolometric luminosity allowus to place limits on the location of the ionizing star in the hr diagram. the3 sigma upper limit on the effective temperature of the ionizing star is 42500k. we favor a luminosity appropriate for star with a mass in excess of about 60solar masses. the limit on the temperature and luminosity exclude stars on thezams and stars within 10^6 yr of the zams. since the age of the uc hii regionis estimated to be only about 10^5 yr, we suggest that this is direct evidencethat the stellar birth line for massive stars at twice solar metallicity mustbe significantly redder than the zams.

astro-ph;9809068	infalling gas towards the galactic center	vla maps of ammonia emission were made for the galactic center region. thenh3(1,1) and nh3(2,2) transitions were observed in three 2' x 2' fieldscovering sgr a* and the region 3' immediately south of it. in the central 3parsecs surrounding sgr a* we find emission which appears to be associated withthe circumnuclear disk (cnd), both morphologically and kinematically. thiscentral emission is connected to a long, narrow 2 pc x 10 pc streamer of clumpymolecular gas located towards the south, which appears to be carrying gas fromthe nearby 20 km/s giant molecular cloud (gmc) to the circumnuclear region. wefind a velocity gradient along the streamer, with progressively highervelocities as the gas approaches sgr a*. the streamer stops at the location ofthe cnd, where the line width of the nh3 emission increases dramatically. thismay be the kinematic signature of accretion onto the cnd. the ratio of thenh3(2,2)/nh3(1,1) emission indicates that the gas is heated at the northern tipof the streamer, located inside the eastern edge of the cnd. the morphology,kinematics and temperature gradients of the gas all indicate that the southernstreamer is located at the galactic center and is interacting with thecircumnuclear region.

0810.3235	inspiralling supermassive black holes: a new signpost for galaxy mergers	we present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergersspectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. our techniqueexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (smbhs) powering activegalactic nuclei (agns) in merger-remnant galaxies. because structure in theuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host acentral smbh, some galaxies should possess two smbhs near their centers as theresult of a recent merger. these smbhs spiral to the center of the resultantmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the smbhs may power agns. using thedeep2 galaxy redshift survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91exhibit [o iii] and hbeta emission lines indicative of seyfert 2 activity. ofthese, 32 agns have [o iii] emission-line redshifts significantly differentfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocityoffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. two of these agns exhibit double-peaked [oiii] emission lines, while the remaining 30 agns each exhibit a single set ofvelocity-offset [o iii] emission lines. after exploring a variety of physicalmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation isinspiralling smbhs in merger-remnant galaxies. based on this interpretation, wefind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting agns are also mergerremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger agn activity in red galaxies.the agn velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a mergerrate of ~3 mergers/gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82.
