0901.2134	spectroscopic detection of carbon monoxide in two late-type t dwarfs	m band spectra of two late-type t dwarfs, 2mass j09373487+2931409, and gliese570d, confirm evidence from photometry that photospheric co is present atabundance levels far in excess of those predicted from chemical equilibrium.these new and unambiguous detections of co, together with an earlierspectroscopic detection of co in gliese 229b and existing m band photometry ofa large selection of t dwarfs, suggest that vertical mixing in the photospheredrives the co abundance out of chemical equilibrium and is a common, and likelyuniversal feature of mid-to-late type t dwarfs. the m band spectra allowdeterminations of the time scale of vertical mixing in the atmosphere of eachobject, the first such measurements of this important parameter in late tdwarfs. a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution of 2massj09373487+2931409 results in the following values for metallicity, temperature,surface gravity, and luminosity: [m/h]~-0.3, t_eff=925-975k, log g=5.20-5.47,log l/l_sun=-5.308 +/- 0.027. the age is 3-10 gyr and the mass is in the range45-69 m_jup.

0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

0906.2991	the 0.8-14.5 micron spectra of mid-l to mid-t dwarfs: diagnostics of  effective temperature, grain sedimentation, gas transport, and surface  gravity	we present new 5.2-14.5 micron low-resolution spectra of 14 mid-l to mid-tdwarfs, as well as 3.0-4.1 micron spectra for five of these dwarfs. these dataare supplemented by existing red and near-infrared spectra (0.6-2.5 micron), aswell as red through mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven other l and t dwarfspresented by cushing et al. (2008). we compare these spectra to those generatedfrom the model atmospheres of saumon &amp; marley (2008). the models reproduce theobserved spectra well, except in the case of one very red l3.5 dwarf, 2massj22244381-0158521. the broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almostindependently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in ourmodels: effective temperature (teff), surface gravity, grain sedimentationefficiency (fsed) and vertical gas transport efficiency (kzz).  the sample of l3.5 to t5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 &lt; teff &lt; 1000 k, withan l-t transition (spectral types l7-t4) that lies between 1400 k and 1100k fordwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 kwarmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. in thismodel analysis, fsed increases rapidly between types t0 and t4, indicating thatincreased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at thisstage of brown dwarf evolution. there is a suggestion that the transition todust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.

1001.0762	mid-infrared photometry of cold brown dwarfs: diversity in age, mass and  metallicity	we present spitzer irac photometry of twelve very late-type t dwarfs; ninehave [3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry and three have [3.6] and [4.5]photometry only. we investigate trends with type and color for the planning andinterpretation of surveys for the coldest t or y dwarfs. brown dwarfs witheffective temperature (t_eff) below 700k emit more than half their flux atwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to thenear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to t_eff. the color h-[4.5] is a goodindicator of t_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity andgravity. conversely, the colors h-k and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive tometallicity and gravity. thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide usefulindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperatureand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionarymodels. there are twelve dwarfs known with h-[4.5]&gt;3.0, and 500&lt; t_eff k &lt; 800,which we examine in detail. the ages of these dwarfs range from very young(0.1-1.0 gyr) to relatively old (3-12 gyr). the mass range is possibly as lowas 5 jupiter masses to up to 70 jupiter masses. the metallicities also span alarge range, from [m/h] -0.3 to [m/h] +0.3. the small number of t8-t9 dwarfsfound in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey to date appear to be mostly younglow-mass dwarfs. extensions to the mid-infrared space missions warm-spitzer andwise are desirable in order to obtain the vital mid-infrared data for coldbrown dwarfs, and to discover more of these rare objects.

1001.4393	the discovery of a very cool binary system	we report the discovery of a very cool d/sdl7+t7.5p common proper motionbinary system, sdss j1416+13ab, found by cross-matching the ukidss large areasurvey data release 5 against the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. thed/sdl7 is blue in j-h and h-k and has other features suggestive oflow-metallicity and/or high gravity. the t7.5p displays spectral peculiarityseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in ukidss las dr4, and referredto as ch4-j-early peculiarity. we suggest that ch4-j-early peculiarity arisesfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use forclassifying t dwarfs. ukidss and follow-up ukirt/wfcam photometry shows the tdwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object withh-k = -1.31+/-0.17. warm spitzer irac photometry shows the t dwarf to haveextremely red h-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for asubstellar object. the lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits ourability to estimate parameters for the system. however, applying a conservativedistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135au. by comparing h-k:h-[4.5] colours of the t dwarf to spectral models weestimate that teff = 500 k and [m/h]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. this suggests amass of ~30 mjupiter for the t dwarf and an age of ~10 gyr for the system. theprimary would then be a 75mjupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relativelydust-free teff ~ 1500k atmosphere. given the unusual properties of the systemwe caution that these estimates are uncertain. we eagerly await parallaxmeasurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parametersfurther.

1004.0317	the discovery of a very cool, very nearby brown dwarf in the galactic  plane	we report the discovery of a very cool, isolated brown dwarf, ugps 0722-05,with the ukidss galactic plane survey. the near-infrared spectrum displaysdeeper h2o and ch4 troughs than the coolest known t dwarfs and an unidentifiedabsorption feature at 1.275 um. we provisionally classify the object as a t10dwarf but note that it may in future come to be regarded as the first exampleof a new spectral type. the distance is measured by trigonometric parallax asd=4.1{-0.5}{+0.6} pc, making it the closest known isolated brown dwarf. withthe aid of spitzer/irac we measure h-[4.5] = 4.71. it is the coolest browndwarf presently known -- the only known t dwarf that is redder in h-[4.5] isthe peculiar t7.5 dwarf sdss j1416+13b, which is thought to be warmer and moreluminous than ugps 0722-05. our measurement of the luminosity, aided bygemini/t-recs n band photometry, is l = 9.2 +/- 3.1x10^{-7} lsun. using acomparison with well studied t8.5 and t9 dwarfs we deduce teff=520 +/- 40 k.this is supported by predictions of the saumon &amp; marley models. with apparentmagnitude j=16.52, ugps 0722-05 is the brightest t dwarf discovered by ukidssso far. it offers opportunities for future study via high resolutionnear-infrared spectroscopy and spectroscopy in the thermal infrared.

1004.1912	forty seven new t dwarfs from the ukidss large area survey	we report the discovery of 47 new t dwarfs in the fourth data release (dr4)from the large area survey (las) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey withspectral types ranging from t0 to t8.5. these bring the total sample of las tdwarfs to 80 as of dr4. in assigning spectral types to our objects we haveidentified 8 new spectrally peculiar objects, and divide 7 of them into twoclasses. h2o-h-early have a h2o-h index that differs with the h2o-j index by atleast 2 sub-types. ch4-j-early have a ch4-j index that disagrees with the h20-jindex by at least 2 subtypes. we have ruled out binarity as a sole explanationfor both types of peculiarity, and suggest that they may represent hithertounrecognised tracers of composition and/or gravity. clear trends in z'(ab)-jand y-j are apparent for our sample, consistent with weakening absorption inthe red wing of the ki line at 0.77microns with decreasing effectivetemperature. we have used our sample to estimate space densities for t6-t9dwarfs. by comparing our sample to monte-carlo simulations of field t dwarfsfor various mass functions of the form phi(m) \propto m^-alpha, we have placedweak constraints on the form of the field mass function. our analysis suggeststhat the substellar mass function is declining at lower masses, with negativevalues of alpha preferred. this is at odds with results for young clusters thathave been generally found to have alpha &gt; 0.

0708.0655	a very cool brown dwarf in ukidss dr1	(abridged) we report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf, ulasj003402.77-005206.7 (ulas j0034-00), identified in ukidss dr1. we provideoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry of the source, and twonear-infrared spectra. comparing the spectral energy distribution of ulasj0034-00 to that of the t8 brown dwarf 2mass j0415-09, the latest-type andcoolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with teff~750 k, we find evidencethat ulas j0034-00 is significantly cooler. first, the measured values of thenear-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, oft8.5. second, the h-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of thetemperature of 540&lt;teff&lt;660 k (+/-2sig range). third, the j- and h-band peaksare somewhat narrower in ulas j0034-00, and detailed comparison againstspectral models calibrated to 2mass j0415-09 yields an estimated temperaturelower by 60-120 k relative to 2mass j0415-09 i.e. 630&lt;teff&lt;690 k (+/-2sig), andlower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination-0.5&lt;delta(log g-2[m/h])&lt;-0.25 (+/-2sig). combining these estimates, andconsidering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range600&lt;teff&lt;700 k. despite the low inferred teff we find no evidence for strongabsorption by nh3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. evolutionary modelsimply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 m(jup) and 0.5-8 gyr,respectively. the measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combinedwith the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangentialvelocity of ~30 km/s. ulas j0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2mass j0415-09in y-j, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler tdwarfs are bluer still.

1006.3710	the discovery of the most metal-rich white dwarf: composition of a  tidally disrupted extrasolar dwarf planet	cool white dwarf stars are usually found to have an outer atmosphere that ispractically pure in hydrogen or helium. however, a small fraction have tracesof heavy elements that must originate from the accretion of extrinsic material,most probably circumstellar matter. upon examining thousands of sloan digitalsky survey spectra, we discovered that the helium-atmosphere white dwarf sdssj073842.56+183509.6 shows the most severe metal pollution ever seen in theoutermost layers of such stars. we present here a quantitative analysis of thisexciting star by combining high s/n follow-up spectroscopic and photometricobservations with model atmospheres and evolutionary models. we determine theglobal structural properties of our target star, as well as the abundances ofthe most significant pollutants in its atmosphere, i.e., h, o, na, mg, si, ca,and fe. the relative abundances of these elements imply that the source of theaccreted material has a composition similar to that of bulk earth. we alsoreport the signature of a circumstellar disk revealed through a large infraredexcess in jhk photometry. combined with our inferred estimate of the mass ofthe accreted material, this strongly suggests that we are witnessing theremains of a tidally disrupted extrasolar body that was as large as ceres.

1008.2200	discovery of a highly unequal-mass binary t dwarf with keck laser guide  star adaptive optics: a coevality test of substellar theoretical models and  effective temperatures	(abridged) highly unequal-mass ratio binaries are rare among field browndwarfs, with the known census described by q^(4.9+/-0.7). however, such systemscan test the joint accuracy of evolutionary and atmospheric models, under theconstraint of coevality (the "isochrone test''). we carry out this test usingtwo of the most extreme field substellar binaries currently known, the t1+t6\eps ind bab binary and a newly discovered 0.14" t2.0+t7.5 binary, 2mass1209-10ab. based on the locations of the components on the h-r diagram, modelssuccessfully indicate that the systems are coeval, with internal agedifferences of log(age) = 0.5{+0.4}{-0.3} and -0.8+/-1.3 dex, respectively.however, the total mass of \eps ind bab derived from the h-r diagram (~80 mjup)is discrepant with the reported dynamical mass. this problem, which isindependent of the assumed age of the system, can be explained by a ~50-100 ksystematic error in the model atmosphere fitting; bringing the two massdeterminations into consistency leads to an inferred age of ~6 gyr for the \epsind system, older than previously assumed. overall, the two t dwarf binariesstudied here, along with recent results from t dwarfs in age and mass benchmarksystems, yield evidence for small (~100 k) errors in the evolutionary modelsand/or model atmospheres, but not significantly larger. finally, the binarynature of 2mass 1209-10ab reduces its utility as the primary t3 near-irspectral typing standard; we suggest sdss 1206+28 as a replacement.

1201.2973	the properties of the 500 k dwarf ugps j072227.51-054031.2, and a study  of the far-red flux of cold brown dwarfs	we present i and z photometry for 25 t dwarfs and one l dwarf. combined withpublished photometry, the data show that the i - z, z - y and z - j colors of tdwarfs are very red, and continue to increase through to the late-type tdwarfs, with a hint of a saturation for the latest types with t_eff ~ 600 k. wepresent new 0.7-1.0 um and 2.8-4.2 um spectra for the very late-type t dwarfugps j072227.51-054031.2, as well as improved astrometry for this dwarf.examination of the spectral energy distribution using the new and publisheddata, with saumon &amp; marley models, shows that the dwarf has t_eff = 505 +/- 10k, a mass of 3-11 m_jupiter and an age between 60 myr and 1 gyr. this young ageis consistent with the thin disk kinematics of the dwarf. the mass rangeoverlaps with that usually considered to be planetary, despite this being anunbound object discovered in the field near the sun. this apparently youngrapid rotator is also undergoing vigorous atmospheric mixing, as determined bythe irac and wise-2 4.5 um photometry and the saumon &amp; marley models. theoptical spectrum for this 500 k object shows clearly detected lines of theneutral alkalis cs and rb, which are emitted from deep atmospheric layers withtemperatures of 900-1200 k.

1206.4044	two extraordinary substellar binaries at the t/y transition and the  y-band fluxes of the coolest brown dwarfs	using keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, we have found that thet9 dwarf wise j1217+1626 and t8 dwarf wise j1711+3500 are exceptional binaries,with unusually wide separations (~0.8 arcsec, 8-15 au), large near-ir fluxratios (~2-3 mags), and small mass ratios (~0.5) compared to previously knownfield ultracool binaries. keck/nirspec h-band spectra give a spectral type ofy0 for wise j1217+1626b, and photometric estimates suggest t9.5 for wisej1711+3500b. the wise j1217+1626ab system is very similar to the t9+y0 binarycfbdsir j1458+1013ab; these two systems are the coldest known substellarmultiples, having secondary components of ~400 k and being planetary-massbinaries if their ages are &lt;~1 gyr. both wise j1217+1626b and cfbdsirj1458+1013b have strikingly blue y-j colors compared to previously known tdwarfs, including their t9 primaries. combining all available data, we findthat y-j color drops precipitously between the very latest t dwarfs and the ydwarfs. the fact that this is seen in (coeval, mono-metallicity) binariesdemonstrates that the color drop arises from a change in temperature, notsurface gravity or metallicity variations among the field population. thus, thet/y transition established by near-ir spectra coincides with a significantchange in the ~1 micron fluxes of ultracool photospheres. one explanation isthe depletion of potassium, whose broad absorption wings dominate the far-redoptical spectra of t dwarfs. this large color change suggests that far-red datamay be valuable for classifying objects of &lt;~500 k.

1206.4313	neglected clouds in t and y dwarf atmospheres	as brown dwarfs cool, a variety of species condense in their atmospheres,forming clouds. iron and silicate clouds shape the emergent spectra of ldwarfs, but these clouds dissipate at the l/t transition. a variety of othercondensates are expected to form in cooler t dwarf atmospheres. these includecr, mns, na2s, zns, and kcl, but the opacity of these optically thinner cloudshas not been included in previous atmosphere models. here, we examine theireffect on model t and y dwarf atmospheres. the cloud structures and opacitiesare calculated using the ackerman &amp; marley (2001) cloud model, which is coupledto an atmosphere model to produce atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles inradiative-convective equilibrium. we generate a suite of models between teff =400 and 1300 k, log g=4.0 and 5.5, and condensate sedimentation efficienciesfrom fsed=2 to 5. model spectra are compared to two red t dwarfs, ross 458c andugps 0722-05; models that include clouds are found to match observed spectrasignificantly better than cloudless models. the emergence of sulfide clouds incool atmospheres, particularly na2s, may be a more natural explanation for the"cloudy" spectra of these objects, rather than the re-emergence of silicateclouds that wane at the l-to-t transition. we find that sulfide clouds providea mechanism to match the near- and mid-infrared colors of observed t dwarfs.our results indicate that including the opacity of condensates in t dwarfatmospheres is necessary to accurately determine the physical characteristicsof many of the observed objects.

1208.5497	locating the trailing edge of the circumbinary ring in the kh 15d system	following two years of complete occultation of both stars by its opaquecircumbinary ring, the binary t tauri star kh 15d has abruptly brightened againduring apastron phases, reaching i = 15 mag. here, we show that the brighteningis accompanied by a change in spectral class from k6/k7 (the spectral class ofstar a) to ~k1, and a bluing of the system in v-i by about 0.3 mag. a radialvelocity measurement confirms that, at apastron, we are now seeing direct lightfrom star b, which is more luminous and of earlier spectral class than star a.evidently, the trailing edge of the occulting screen has just become tangent toone anse of star b's projected orbit. this confirms a prediction of theprecession models, supports the view that the tilted ring is self-gravitating,and ushers in a new era of the system's evolution that should be accompanied bythe same kind of dramatic phenomena observed from 1995-2009. it also promoteskh 15d from a single-lined to a double-lined eclipsing binary, greatlyenhancing its value for testing pre-main sequence models. the results of ourstudy strengthen the case for truncation of the outer ring at around 4 au by asub-stellar object such as an extremely young giant planet. the system iscurrently at an optimal configuration for detecting the putative planet and weurge expedient follow-up observations.

0801.2371	clouds search for variability in brown dwarf atmospheres	context: l-type ultra-cool dwarfs and brown dwarfs have cloudy atmospheresthat could host weather-like phenomena. the detection of photometric orspectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmosphericheterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.  aims: it has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global clouddeck may account for the l- to t-type transition as brown dwarf photospheresevolve from cloudy to clear conditions. such a mechanism is compatible withvariability. we searched for variability in the spectra of five l6 to t6 browndwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.  methods: we obtained spectroscopic time series using vlt/isaac, over0.99-1.13um, and irtf/spex for two of our targets, in j, h and k bands. wesearch for statistically variable lines and correlation between those.  results: high spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, butthese detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. we find no evidence forlarge amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upperlimits of 2 to 3% on broad-band variability, on the time scale of a few hours.the t2 transition brown dwarf sdss j1254-0122 shows numerous variable features,but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations.  conclusions: assuming that any variability arises from the rotation ofpatterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we findthat the typical physical scale of cloud cover disruption should be smallerthan 5-8% of the disk area for four of our targets. the possible variationsseen in sdss j1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloudbreaking hypothesis.

0804.3398	near-infrared constraints on the presence of warm dust at metal-rich,  helium atmosphere white dwarfs	here, we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 15 heliumatmosphere, metal-rich white dwarfs obtained at the nasa infrared telescopefacility. while a connection has been demonstrated between the most highlypolluted, hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs and the presence of warmcircumstellar dust and gas, their frequency at the helium atmosphere variety ispoorly constrained. none of our targets show excess near-infrared radiationconsistent with warm orbiting material. adding these near-infrared constraintsto previous near- and mid-infrared observations, the frequency of warmcircumstellar material at metal-bearing white dwarfs is at least 20% forhydrogen-dominated photospheres, but could be less than 5% for thoseeffectively composed of helium alone. the lower occurrence of dust disks aroundhelium atmosphere white dwarfs is consistent with myr timescales forphotospheric metals in massive convection zones. analyzing the massdistribution of 10 white dwarfs with warm circumstellar material, we search forsimilar trends between the frequency of disks and the predicted frequency ofmassive planets around intermediate mass stars, but find the probability thatdisk-bearing white dwarfs are more massive than average is not significant.

1502.04707	discovery of a low-luminosity, tight substellar binary at the t/y  transition	we have discovered that the brown dwarf wisej014656.66+423410.0 is a closebinary (0.0875$\pm$0.0021 arcsec, 0.93$^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ au) from keck laserguide star adaptive optics imaging. our photometry for this system reveals thatboth components are less luminous than those in any known substellar binary.combining a new integrated-light spectrum (t9p) and resolved yjh-bandphotometry from keck allows us to perform spectral decomposition and assigncomponent types of t9 and y0. many of the unusual features in the spectrummight be explained by high surface gravity: y-band peak broadened to the blue;j-band peak broadened to the red; h-band peak shifted slightly to the red; andred y-j colors. interestingly, the very low component luminosities imply thatthe t9 primary is unexpectedly cold ($t_{\rm eff}$ = 345$\pm$45 k assuming anage of 10 gyr), making it $\approx$100 k cooler than any other late-t dwarf andcomparable to y dwarfs. one intriguing explanation for this apparentdiscrepancy is that the j- and h-band spectral features that trigger thetransition from t to y spectral types are highly gravity-dependent. this can betested directly in the very near future by orbit monitoring. we constrain theorbital period to be $\lesssim$10 yr by combining evolutionary model-based massestimates for the components ($\approx$12$-$21 $m_{\rm jup}$, 1$\sigma$ at 10gyr) with a statistical constraint on the semimajor axis ($\lesssim$1.3 au).such a period is shorter than any other known t/y transition binary, meaningthat wisej0146+4234ab will likely yield a dynamical mass within the next fewyears.

1503.04715	methane and ammonia in the near-infrared spectra of late t dwarfs	analysis of t dwarfs using model atmospheres has been hampered by the absenceof reliable line lists for methane and ammonia. newly computed high temperatureline lists for both of these important molecules are now available, so it istimely to investigate the appearance of the various absorption features in tdwarfs in order to better understand their atmospheres and validate the newline lists. we present high quality r~5000 gemini/nifs 1.0-2.4 microns spectraof the t8 standard 2mass 0415-0935 and the t9 standard ugps 0722-0540. we usethese spectra to identify numerous methane and ammonia features not previouslyseen and we discuss the implications for our understanding of t dwarfatmospheres. among our results, we find that ammonia is the dominant opacitysource between ~1.233-1.266 microns in ugps 0722-0540, and we tentativelyidentify several absorption features in this wavelength range in the t9'sspectrum which may be due entirely to ammonia opacity. our results also suggestthat water rather than methane is the dominant opacity source in the red halfof the j-band of the t8 dwarf. water appears to be the main absorber in thiswavelength region in the t9 dwarf until ~1.31 microns, when methane starts todominate.

(2006). seven of the new t dwarfs havespectral types of t2.5-t4.5, five have spectral types of t5-t5.5, one is at6.5p, and two are t7-7.5. we assess spectral morphology and colours toidentify t dwarfs in our sample that may have non-typical physical properties(by comparison to solar neighbourhood populations). the colours of the fullsample of las t dwarfs show a possible trend to bluer y-j with decreasingeffective temperature beyond t8. by accounting for the main sources ofincompleteness (selection, follow-up and spatial) as well as the effects ofunresolved binarity and malmquist bias, we estimate that there are 17+-4 &gt;=t4dwarfs in the j&lt;=19 volume of the las second data release. comparing this totheoretical predictions is most consistent with a sub-stellar mass functionexponent alpha between -1.0 and 0. this is consistent with the latest2mass/sdss constraint (which is based on lower number statistics), and issignificantly lower than the alpha~1.0 suggested by l dwarf field populations,possibly a result of the lower mass range probed by the t dwarf class.

astro-ph;0004408	the missing link: early methane ("t") dwarfs in the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of three cool brown dwarfs which fall in theeffective temperature gap between the latest l dwarfs currently known, with nomethane absorption bands in the 1-2.5um range, and the previously known methane(t) dwarfs, whose spectra are dominated by methane and water. the newlydiscovered objects were detected as very red objects in the sloan digital skysurvey imaging data and have jhk colors between the red l dwarfs and the bluegl229b-like t dwarfs. they show both co and methane absorption in theirnear-infrared spectra in addition to water, with weaker methane absorptionfeatures in the h and k bands than those in all other methane dwarfs reportedto date. due to the presence of methane in these bands, we propose that theseobjects are early t dwarfs. the three form part of the brown dwarf spectralsequence and fill in the large gap in the overall spectral sequence from thehottest main sequence stars to the coolest methane dwarfs currently known.

astro-ph;0011286	photometric and spectroscopic analysis of cool white dwarfs with  trigonometric parallax measurements	a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 152 cool white dwarf stars ispresented. the discovery of 7 new da white dwarfs, 2 new dq white dwarfs, 1 newmagnetic white dwarf, and 3 weak magnetic white dwarf candidates, is reported,as well as 19 known or suspected double degenerates. the photometric energydistributions, the halpha line profiles, and the trigonometric parallaxmeasurements are combined and compared to model atmosphere calculations todetermine the effective temperature and the radius of each object, and also toconstrain the atmospheric composition. new evolutionary sequences with c/ocores with thin and thick hydrogen layers are used to derive masses and ages.we confirm the existence of a range in teff between 5000 and 6000k where almostall white dwarfs have h-rich atmospheres. there is little evidence for mixedh/he dwarfs, with the exception of 2 he-rich da stars, and 5 c2h white dwarfswhich possibly have mixed h/he/c atmospheres. the dq sequence terminates near6500k, below which they are believed to turn into c2h stars. true dc starsslightly above this temperature are found to exhibit h-like energydistributions despite the lack of halpha absorption. attempts to interpret thechemical evolution show the problem to be complex. convective mixing isnecessary to account for the non-da to da ratio as a function of temperature.the presence of helium in cool da stars, the existence of the non-da gap, andthe peculiar dc stars are also explained in terms of convective mixing,although our understanding of how this mechanism works needs to be revised. theoldest object in our sample is about 7.9 gyr or 9.7 gyr old depending onwhether thin or thick hydrogen layer models are used. the mean mass of oursample is 0.65 +/- 0.20 msun.

astro-ph;0102059	infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs: the onset of methane absorption  in l dwarfs and the l/t transition	we present infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with spectral types from mid-l tot. the 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m spectra of three dwarfs found by the sloan digital skysurvey contain absorption bands of both methane and carbon monoxide and bridgethe gap between late l and previously observed t dwarfs. these dwarfs form aclear spectral sequence, with ch$_{4}$ absorption increasing as the coabsorption decreases. water vapor band strengths increase in parallel with themethane bands and thus also link the l and t types. we suggest that objectswith detectable co and ch$_{4}$ in the h and k bands should define the earliestt subclasses. from observations of bright (k~$\leq$~13 mag) l dwarfs found by2mass, we find that the onset of detectable amounts of ch$_{4}$ occurs nearspectral type l5. for this spectral type methane is observable in the3.3~$\mu$m $\nu$$_{3}$ band only, and not in the overtone and combination bandsat h and k.

astro-ph;0108435	infrared photometry of late-m, l, and t dwarfs	we present zjhkl'm' photometry of a sample of 58 late-m, l, and t dwarfs,most of which are identified from the sloan digital sky survey and the twomicron all-sky survey. near-infrared spectra and spectral classifications formost of this sample are presented in a companion paper by geballe et al. wederive the luminosities of 18 dwarfs in the sample and the results imply thatthe effective temperature range for the l dwarfs in our sample is approximately2200-1300 k and for the t dwarfs 1300-800 k. we obtained new photometric dataat the united kingdom infrared telescope for: 42 dwarfs at z, 34 dwarfs at jhk,21 dwarfs at l', as well as m' data for two l dwarfs and two t dwarfs. the m'data provide the first accurate photometry for l and t dwarfs in this bandpass- for a t2 and a t5 dwarf, we find k-m'=1.2 and 1.6, respectively. these colorsare much bluer than predicted by models suggesting that co may be more abundantin these objects than expected, as has been found for the t6 dwarf gl 229b. wealso find that k-l' increases monotonically through most of the m, l, and tsubclasses, but it is almost constant between types l6 and t5. the degeneracyis probably due to the onset of methane absorption at the blue edge of the l'bandpass. the jhk colors of l dwarfs show significant scatter, suggesting thatthe fluxes in these bandpasses are sensitive to variations in photospheric dustproperties. the h-k colors of the later t dwarfs also show some scatter whichwe suggest is due to variations in pressure-induced molecular hydrogen opacity,which is sensitive to gravity and metallicity.

astro-ph;0108443	towards spectral classification of l and t dwarfs: infrared and optical  spectroscopy and analysis	we present 0.6-2.5um, r~400 spectra of twenty-seven cool, low luminositystars and substellar objects. based on these and previously published spectrawe develop a preliminary spectral classification system for l and t dwarfs. forlate l and t types the classification system is based entirely on four spectralindices in the 1-2.5um interval. two of these indices are derived from waterabsorption bands at 1.15um and 1.4um, the latter of which shows a smoothincrease in depth through the l and t sequences and can be used to classifyboth spectral types. the other two indices make use of methane absorptionfeatures in the h and k bands, with the k band index also applicable to mid tolate l dwarfs. continuum indices shortward of 1um used by previous authors toclassify l dwarfs are found to be useful only through mid l subclasses. weemploy the 1.5um water index and the 2.2um methane index to complete the lclassification through l9.5 and to link the new system with a modified versionof the 2mass ``color-d'' index. by correlating the depths of the methane andwater absorption features, we establish a t spectral sequence from types t0 tot8, based on all four indices, which is a smooth continuation of the lsequence. we reclassify two 2mass l8 dwarfs as l9 and l9.5 and identify onesdss object as l9. in the proposed system methane absorption appears in the kband approximately at l8, two subclasses earlier than its appearance in the hband. the l and t spectral classes are distinguished by the absence andpresence, respectively, of h band methane absorption.

astro-ph;0109331	infrared classification of l and t dwarfs	we use new and published medium resolution 0.6--2.5 $\mu$m spectra of l and tdwarfs to develop a unified classification system for both of these newspectral classes. two indices of the system at 1.2 $\mu$m and 1.5 $\mu$m arebased on nearby absorption bands of water vapor and two are associated withmethane bands near 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.2 $\mu$m. the 1.5 $\mu$m index is monotonicthrough the l and t sequences, and forms the backbone of the system; theindices for the other bands provide extensive, but only partial, coverage. wecorrelate the 1.5 $\mu$m index with continuum indices shortward of 1 $\mu$mdevised by others for classifying l dwarfs, in order to obtain a tight linkbetween optical and infrared classifications. our proposed system defines tenspectral subclasses for l (l0--l9) and nine for t (t0--t8). the boundarybetween l and t is defined to be the onset of absorption by methane in the hband. methane absorption in the k band near 2.2 $\mu$m is found to beginapproximately at l8.

astro-ph;0109360	infrared colors of l and t dwarfs	we discuss the behaviour of the jhkl'm' colors of l and t dwarfs, based onphotometric and spectroscopic data obtained at the united kingdom infraredtelescope in hawaii. we have measured the first accurate m' photometry for land t dwarfs. the k-m' colors of t dwarfs are much bluer than predicted bypublished models, suggesting that co may be more abundant than expected, as hasbeen found spectroscopically for the t6 dwarf gl 229b. we also find that k-l'increases monotonically through most of the m, l, and t subclasses, but it isapproximately constant between types l6 and t5, due to the onset of methaneabsorption at the blue edge of the l' bandpass. the jhk colors of l dwarfs showsignificant scatter, suggesting variations in the amount and properties ofphotospheric dust, and indicating that it may not be possible to associate aunique effective temperature with a given l spectral type. the h-k colors ofthe later t dwarfs also show some scatter which we suggest is due to variationsin pressure-induced molecular hydrogen opacity, which is sensitive to gravity(or age for a brown dwarf) and metallicity.

astro-ph;0312588	analysis of a very massive da white dwarf via the trigonometric parallax  and spectroscopic methods	by two different methods, we show that lhs 4033 is an extremely massive whitedwarf near its likely upper mass limit for destruction by unstable electroncaptures. from the accurate trigonometric parallax reported herein, theeffective temperature (t=10,900 k) and the stellar radius (r=0.00368 r_sun) aredirectly determined from the broad-band spectral energy distribution -- theparallax method. the effective temperature and surface gravity are alsoestimated independently from the simultaneous fitting of the observed balmerline profiles with those predicted from pure-hydrogen model atmospheres -- thespectroscopic method (t=10,760 k, log g=9.46). the mass of lhs 4033 is theninferred from theoretical mass-radius relations appropriate for white dwarfs.the parallax method yields a mass estimate of 1.310--1.330 m_sun, for interiorcompositions ranging from pure magnesium to pure carbon, respectively, whilethe spectroscopic method yields an estimate of 1.318--1.335 m_sun for the samecore compositions. this star is the most massive white dwarf for which a robustcomparison of the two techniques has been made.

astro-ph;0402475	l' and m' photometry of ultracool dwarfs	we have compiled l' and m' photometry of 63 single and binary m, l,and tdwarfs obtained at ukirt using the mko filter set. this compilation includesnew l' data for 8 l dwarfs and 13 t dwarfs and new m' data for 7 l dwarfs, 5 tdwarfs, and gl 229a. we compute l_bol, bc_k, and t_eff for 42 dwarfs whoseflux-calibrated jhk spectra, l' photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes areavailable, and we estimate these quantities for 9 other dwarfs whose parallaxesand flux-calibrated spectra have been obtained. bc_k is a well-behaved functionof near-ir spectral type with a dispersion of ~0.1 mag for types m6-t5; it issignificantly more scattered for types t5-t9. t_eff declines steeply andmonotonically for types m6-l7 and t4-t9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 k fortypes l7-t4 with assumed ages of ~3 gyr. this constant t_eff is evidenced bynearly unchanging values of l'-m' between types l6 and t3. we compare theobserved k, l', and m' luminosities of l and t dwarfs in our sample with thosepredicted by model atmospheres with varying surface gravities and sedimentationefficiencies. the models indicate that the l3-t4.5 dwarfs generally have highergravities (log g = 5.0-5.5) than the t6-t9 dwarfs (log g = 4.5-5.0). thepredicted m' luminosities of t dwarfs are 1.5-2.5 times larger than thosederived empirically for the t dwarfs in our sample. this discrepancy isattributed to absorption at 4.5-4.9 um by co, which is not expected under thecondition of chemical equilibrium assumed in the models. we determine that thel3 dwarf kelu-1 and the t0 dwarf sdss j0423-0414 are probable binary systems.we compute log(l_bol/l_sun) = -5.73 +/- 0.05 and t_eff = 600-750 k for the t9dwarf 2mass j0415-0935, which supplants gl 570d as the least luminous andcoolest brown dwarf presently known.

astro-ph;0510090	a unified near infrared spectral classification scheme for t dwarfs	a revised near infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is presented,based on and superseding prior schemes developed by burgasser et al. andgeballe et al., and defined following the precepts of the mk process. drawingfrom two large spectroscopic libraries of t dwarfs identified largely in thesloan digital sky survey and the two micron all sky survey, nine primaryspectral standards and five alternate standards spanning spectral types t0 tot8 are identified that match criteria of spectral character, brightness,absence of a resolved companion and accessibility from both northern andsouthern hemispheres. the classification of t dwarfs is formally made by thedirect comparison of near infrared spectral data of equivalent resolution tothe spectra of these standards. alternately, we have redefined five keyspectral indices measuring the strengths of the major h$_2$o and ch$_4$ bandsin the 1-2.5 micron region that may be used as a proxy to direct spectralcomparison. two methods of determining t spectral type using these indices areoutlined and yield equivalent results. these classifications are alsoequivalent to those from prior schemes, implying that no revision of existingspectral type trends is required. the one-dimensional scheme presented hereprovides a first step toward the observational characterization of the lowestluminosity brown dwarfs currently known. future extensions to incorporatespectral variations arising from differences in photospheric dust content,gravity and metallicity are briefly discussed. a compendium of all currentlyknown t dwarfs with updated classifications is presented.

astro-ph;0605037	sdss j1534+1615ab: a novel t dwarf binary found with keck laser guide  star adaptive optics and the potential role of binarity in the l/t transition	we have resolved the newly discovered t dwarf sdss j1534+1615 into a 0.11''binary using the keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics system. with anintegrated-light spectral type of t3.5, this binary provides a new benchmarkfor studying the distinctive j-band brightening previously noted among earlyand mid-t dwarfs, using two brown dwarfs with different spectral types buthaving a common metallicity and age and very similar surface gravities. weestimate spectral types of t1.5+/-0.5 and t5.5+/-0.5 for the two componentsbased on their near-ir colors, consistent with modeling the integrated-lightspectrum as the blend of two components. the observed near-ir flux ratios areunique compared to all previously known substellar binaries: the component thatis fainter at h and k' is brighter at j. this inversion of the near-ir fluxesis a manifestation of the j-band brightening within this individual binarysystem. therefore, sdss 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can beintrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/orrapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result fromphysical variations among the observed ensemble of t dwarfs (e.g., a range inmasses, ages and/or metallicities). we suggest that the apparently largeamplitude of the j-band brightening may be due to a high incidence ofunresolved binaries and that the true amplitude of the phenomenon could be moremodest. this scenario would imply that truly single objects in these spectralsubclasses are relatively rare, in agreement with the small effectivetemperature range inferred for the l/t transition.

astro-ph;0605639	a spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) spectral sequence of m, l, and t  dwarfs	we present a low-resolution (r = 90), 5.5-38 micron spectral sequence of asample of m, l, and t dwarfs obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard the spitzer space telescope. the spectra exhibit prominent absorptionbands of h_2o at 6.27 microns, ch_4 at 7.65 microns, and nh_3 at 10.5 micronsand are relatively featureless at lambda &gt; 15 microns. three spectral indicesthat measure the strengths of these bands are presented; h_2o absorptionfeatures are present throughout the mlt sequence while the ch_4 and nh_3 bandsfirst appear at roughly the l/t transition. although the spectra are, ingeneral, qualitatively well matched by synthetic spectra that include theformation of spatially homogeneous silicate and iron condensate clouds, thespectra of the mid-type l dwarfs show an unexpected flattening from roughly 9to 11 microns. we hypothesize that this may be a result of a population ofsmall silicate grains that are not predicted in the cloud models. the spectrumof the peculiar t6 dwarf 2mass j0937+2931 is suppressed from 5.5-7.5 micronsrelative to typical t6 dwarfs and may be a consequence of its mildlymetal-poor/high surface gravity atmosphere. finally, we compute bolometricluminosities of a subsample of the m, l, and t dwarfs by combining the irsspectra with previously published 0.6-4.1 micron spectra and find goodagreement with the values of golimowski et al. who use l'- and m'-bandphotometry and to account for the flux emitted at lambda &gt; 2.5 microns.

astro-ph;0609461	jhk observations of faint standard stars in the mauna kea near-infrared  photometric system	jhk photometry in the mauna kea observatory (mko) near-ir system is presentedfor 115 stars. of these, 79 are ukirt standards and 42 are lco standards. theaverage brightness is 11.5 mag, with a range of 10 to 15. the average number ofnights each star was observed is 4, and the average of the internal error ofthe final results is 0.011 mag. these jhk data agree with those reported byother groups to 0.02 mag. the measurements are used to derive transformationsbetween the mko jhk photometric system and the ukirt, lco and 2mass systems.the 2mass-mko data scatter by 0.05 mag for redder stars: 2mass-j includes h2ofeatures in dwarfs and mko-k includes co features in giants. transformationsderived for stars whose spectra contain only weak features cannot give accuratetransformations for objects with strong absorption features within a filterbandpasses. we find evidence of systematic effects at the 0.02 mag level in thephotometry of stars with j&lt;11 and h,k&lt;10.5. this is due to an underestimate ofthe linearity correction for stars observed with the shortest exposure times;very accurate photometry of stars approaching the saturation limits of infrareddetectors which are operated in double-read mode is difficult to obtain. fourstars in the sample, gspc s705-d, fs 116 (b216-b7), fs 144 (ser-ec84) and fs 32(feige 108), may be variable. 84 stars in the sample have 11&lt; j&lt; 15 and10.5&lt;h,k&lt;15, are not suspected to be variable, and have magnitudes with anestimated error &lt;0.027 mag; 79 of these have an error of &lt;0.020 mag. theserepresent the first published high-accuracy jhk stellar photometry in the mkophotometric system; we recommend these objects be employed as primary standardsfor that system [abridged].

astro-ph;0611062	physical parameters of two very cool t dwarfs	we present new infrared spectra of the t8 brown dwarf 2massj04151954-0935066: 2.9-4.1 micron spectra obtained with the infrared camera andspectrograph on the subaru telescope, and 5.2-14.5 micron spectra obtained withthe infrared spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope. we use these data andmodels to determine an accurate bolometric luminosity of log l_bol/l_sun=-5.67and to constrain the effective temperature, gravity, mass and age to 725-775k,log g=5.00-5.37, m=33-58 m_jupiter and age=3-10gyr. we perform the sameanalysis using published 0.6-15 micron spectra for the t7.5 dwarf 2massj12171110-0311131, for which we find a metal-rich composition ([fe/h]~0.3) andlog l_bol/l_sun=-5.31, t_eff=850-950k, log g=4.80-5.42, m=25-66m_jupiter andage=1-10gyr. these luminosities and effective temperatures straddle thosedetermined with the same method and models for gl 570d by saumon et al. (2006)and make 2mass j04151954-0935066 the coolest and least luminous t dwarf withwell-determined properties. we find that synthetic spectra generated by themodels reproduce the observed red through mid-infrared spectra of 2massj04151954-0935066 and 2mass j12171110-0311131 very well, except for knowndiscrepancies which are most likely due to the incomplete ch4 opacities. bothobjects show evidence of departures from strict chemical equilibrium and wediscuss this result in the context of other late t dwarfs where disequilibriumphenomena have been observed.

astro-ph;0701111	the late-t dwarf companion to the exoplanet host star hd 3651: a new  benchmark for gravity and metallicity effects in ultracool spectra	(abridged) we present near-ir photometry and spectroscopy of hd 3651b, thelow-luminosity, wide-separation (480 au) companion to the k0v exoplanet hoststar hd 3651a. we find a spectral type of t7.5+/-0.5, a temperature of 780-840k, and a mass of 40-72 mjup; its bolometric luminosity and effectivetemperature are among the lowest measured for any brown dwarf. we estimate anage of 3-12 gyr for the primary star hd 3651a and find that it is ~3x olderthan the k4v star gl 570a (1-5 gyr), the host star of the t7.5 dwarf gl 570d.hd 3651b belongs to the rare class of substellar objects that are companions tomain-sequence stars and thus provides a new benchmark for studying verylow-temperature objects. given their similar temperatures (within ~30 k) andmetallicities (within ~0.1 dex) but different ages, a comparison of hd 3651band gl 570d allows us to examine gravity-sensitive diagnostics in ultracoolspectra. we find that the expected signature of hd 3651b's higher surfacegravity due to its older age, namely a suppressed k-band flux relative to gl570d, is not seen. instead, the k-band flux of hd 3651b is enhanced compared togl 570d, indicative of a younger age. thus, the relative ages derived frominterpretation of t dwarf spectra and from stellar activity indicators appearto be in discord. one likely explanation is that the k-band fluxes are alsovery sensitive to metallicity differences. metallicity variations may be asimportant as surface gravity variations in causing spectral differences amongfield late-t dwarfs.

astro-ph;0701398	moderate resolution spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) observations of  m, l, and t dwarfs	we present 10 - 19 um moderate resolution spectra of ten m dwarfs, one ldwarf, and two t dwarf systems obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard the spitzer space telescope. the irs allows us to examine molecularspectroscopic features/lines at moderate spectral resolution in a heretoforeuntapped wavelength regime. these r~600 spectra allow for a more detailedexamination of clouds, non-equilibrium chemistry, as well as the molecularfeatures of h2o, nh3, and other trace molecular species that are the hallmarksof these objects. a cloud-free model best fits our mid-infrared spectrum of thet1 dwarf epsilon indi ba, and we find that the nh3 feature in epsilon indi bbis best explained by a non-equilibrium abundance due to vertical transport inits atmosphere. we examined a set of objects (mostly m dwarfs) in multiplesystems to look for evidence of emission features, which might indicate anatmospheric temperature inversion, as well as trace molecular species; however,we found no evidence of either.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

astro-ph;9807255	infrared colors at the stellar/substellar boundary	we present new infrared photometry for 61 halo and disk stars around thestellar/substellar boundary. these data are combined with available opticalphotometry and astrometric data to produce color--color and absolutemagnitude--color diagrams. the disk and halo sequences are compared to thepredictions of the latest model atmospheres and structural models.  we find good agreement between observation and theory except for knownproblems in the v and h passbands probably due to incomplete molecular data fortio, metal hydrides and h$_2$o. the metal--poor m subdwarfs are well matched bythe models as oxide opacity sources are less important in this case. the knownextreme m subdwarfs have metallicities about one--hundredth solar, and thecoolest subdwarfs have t$_{eff}\sim 3000$ k with masses $\sim$0.09m/m$_{\odot}$. the grainless models are not able to reproduce the fluxdistributions of disk objects with t$_{eff} &lt;$ 2500 k, however a preliminaryversion of the nextgen--dusty models which includes homogeneous formation andextinction by dust grains {\it is} able to match the colors of these very coolobjects. the least luminous objects in this sample are gd165b, three denisobjects --- dbd0205, dbd1058 and dbd1228 --- and kelu-1. these havet$_{eff}\sim$ 2000 k and are at or below the stellar limit with masses$\leq$0.075m/m$_{\odot}$. photometry alone cannot constrain these parametersfurther as the age is unknown, but published lithium detections for two ofthese objects (kelu-1 and dbd1228) imply that they are young (aged about 1 gyr)and substellar (mass $\leq$0.06m/m$_{\odot}$).

0810.4011	cool white dwarfs identified in the second data release of the ukirt  infrared deep sky survey	we have paired the second data release of the large area survey of the ukirtinfrared deep sky survey with the fifth data release of the sloan digital skysurvey to identify ten cool white dwarf candidates, from their photometry andastrometry. of these ten, one was previously known to be a very cool whitedwarf. we have obtained optical spectroscopy for seven of the candidates usingthe gmos-n spectrograph on gemini north, and have confirmed all seven as whitedwarfs. our photometry and astrometry indicates that the remaining two objectsare also white dwarfs. model analysis of the photometry and availablespectroscopy shows that the seven confirmed new white dwarfs, and the two newlikely white dwarfs, have effective temperatures in the range teff = 5400-6600k. our analysis of the previously known white dwarf confirms that it is cool,with teff = 3800 k. the cooling age for this dwarf is 8.7 gyr, while that ofthe nine ~6000 k white dwarfs is 1.8-3.6 gyr. we are unable to determine themasses of the white dwarfs from the existing data, and therefore we cannotconstrain the total ages of the white dwarfs. the large cooling age for thecoolest white dwarf in the sample, combined with its low estimated tangentialvelocity, suggests that it is an old member of the thin disk, or a member ofthe thick disk of the galaxy, with an age 10-11 gyr. the warmer white dwarfsappear to have velocities typical of the thick disk or even halo; these may bevery old remnants of low-mass stars, or they may be relatively young thin diskobjects with unusually high space motion.
