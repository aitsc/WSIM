0901.1237	star formation history in the smc: the case of ngc602	deep hst/acs photometry of the young cluster ngc 602, located in the remotelow density "wing" of the small magellanic cloud, reveals numerous pre-mainsequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. the resolvedstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation historyinto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, suchas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binaryfraction. to better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present anew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase withmetallicity appropriate for the small magellanic cloud (z = 0.004). we use astellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range ofstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formationhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitudediagrams. the derived present day mass function for ngc 602 is consistent withthat resulting from the synthetic diagrams. the star formation rate in theregion has increased with time on a scale of tens of myr, reaching $0.3-0.7\times 10^{-3} m_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 myr, comparable to what isfound in galactic ob associations. star formation is most complete in the maincluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of thenebula.

0909.2742	very low mass white dwarfs with a c-o core	the lower limit for the mass of white dwarfs (wds) with c-o core is commonlyassumed to be roughly 0.5 msun. as a consequence, wds of lower masses areusually identified as he-core remnants. however, when the initial mass of theprogenitor star is in between 1.8 and 3 msun, which corresponds to the socalled red giant (rgb) phase transition, the mass of the h-exhausted core atthe tip of the rgb is 0.3 &lt; m_h/msun &lt; 0.5. prompted by this well known resultof stellar evolution theory, we investigate the possibility to form c-o wdswith mass m &lt; 0.5 msun. the pre-wd evolution of stars with initial mass ofabout 2.3 msun, undergoing anomalous mass-loss episodes during the rgb phaseand leading to the formation of wds with he-rich or co-rich cores have beencomputed. the cooling sequences of the resulting wds are also described. weshow that the minimum mass for a c-o wd is about 0.33 msun, so that both he andc-o core wds can exist in the mass range 0.33-0.5 msun. the models computed forthe present paper provide the theoretical tools to indentify the observationalcounterpart of very low mass remnants with a c-o core among those commonlyascribed to the he-core wd population in the progressively growing sample ofobserved wds of low mass. moreover, we show that the central he-burning phaseof the stripped progeny of the 2.3 msun star lasts longer and longer as thetotal mass decreases. in particular, the m= 0.33 msun model takes about 800 myrto exhausts its central helium, which is more than three time longer than thevalue of the standard 2.3 msun star: it is, by far, the longest core-he burninglifetime. finally, we find the occurrence of gravonuclear instabilities duringthe he-burning shell phase.

0909.4661	stromgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. ii metallicity  distribution of red giants in omega centauri	we present new intermediate-band stroemgren photometry based on more than 300u,v,b,y images of the galactic globular cluster omega cen. optical data weresupplemented with new multiband near-infrared (nir) photometry (350 j,h,k_simages). the final optical-nir catalog covers a region of more than 20*20arcmin squared across the cluster center. we use different optical-nircolor-color planes together with proper motion data available in the literatureto identify candidate cluster red giant (rg) stars. by adopting differentstroemgren metallicity indices we estimate the photometric metallicity for~4,000 rgs, the largest sample ever collected. the metallicity distributionsshow multiple peaks([fe/h]_phot=-1.73+/-0.08,-1.29+/-0.03,-1.05+/-0.02,-0.80+/-0.04,-0.42+/-0.12and -0.07+/-0.08 dex) and a sharp cut-off in the metal-poor tail([fe/h]_phot&lt;=-2 dex) that agree quite well with spectroscopic measurements. weidentify four distinct sub-populations,namely metal-poor (mp,[fe/h]&lt;=-1.49),metal-intermediate (mi,-1.49&lt;[fe/h]&lt;=-0.93), metal-rich(mr,-0.95&lt;[fe/h]&lt;=-0.15) and solar metallicity (sm,[fe/h]~0). the last groupincludes only a small fraction of stars (~8+/-5%) and should be confirmedspectroscopically. moreover, using the difference in metallicity based ondifferent photometric indices, we find that the 19+/-1% of rgs are candidatecn-strong stars. this fraction agrees quite well with recent spectroscopicestimates and could imply a large fraction of binary stars. the stroemgrenmetallicity indices display a robust correlation with alpha-elements([ca+si/h]) when moving from the metal-intermediate to the metal-rich regime([fe/h]&gt;-1.7 dex).

0911.2840	uncertainties on the theoretical predictions for classical cepheid  pulsational quantities	the expected distribution of cepheids within the instability strip isaffected by several model inputs, reflecting upon the predictedperiod-luminosity relation. on the basis of new and updated sets ofevolutionary and pulsational models, we quantitatively evaluated the effects onthe theoretical pl relation of current uncertainties on the chemical abundancesof cepheids in the large magellanic cloud and on several physical assumptionsadopted in the evolutionary models. we analysed how the different factorsinfluence the evolutionary and pulsational observables and the resulting plrelation. as a result, we found that present uncertainties on the most relevanth and he burning reaction rates do not influence in a relevant way the loopextension in temperature. on the contrary, current uncertainties on the lmcchemical composition significantly affect the loop extension and also reflectin the morphology of the instability strip; however their influence on thepredicted pulsational parameters is negligible. we also discussed howovershooting and mass loss influence the ml relation and the pulsationalparameters. in summary, the present uncertainties on the physical inputsadopted in the evolutionary codes and in the lmc chemical composition arenegligible for the prediction of the main pulsational properties; the inclusionof overshooting in the previous h burning phase and/or of mass loss is expectedto significantly change the resulting theoretical pulsational scenario forcepheids, as well as the calibration of their distance scale. these systematiceffects are expected to influence the theoretical cepheid calibration of thesecondary distance indicators and in turn the resulting evaluation of thehubble constant.

0912.0824	on a new near-infrared method to estimate the absolute ages of star  clusters: ngc3201 as a first test case	we present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.this method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequenceturn-off (msto) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence(msk). this feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (nir) andin optical-nir color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. we took advantageof deep and accurate nir images collected with the multi-conjugate adaptiveoptics demonstrator temporarily available on the very large telescope and ofoptical images collected with the advanced camera for surveys wide field cameraon the hubble space telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate theabsolute age of the globular ngc3201 using both the msto and thedelta(msto-msk). we have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we foundthat the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.however, the errors of the ages based on the delta(msto-msk) method arepotentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected byuncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.current isochrones appear topredict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) nir and optical-nir colors than observed formagnitudes fainter than the msk.

1001.4442	pre-main sequence turn-on as a chronometer for young clusters: ngc346 as  a benchmark	we present a novel approach to derive the age of very young star clusters, byusing the turn-on (ton). the ton is the point in the color-magnitude diagram(cmd) where the pre-main sequence (pms) joins the main sequence (ms). in the msluminosity function (lf) of the cluster, the ton is identified as a peakfollowed by a dip. we propose that by combining the cmd analysis with themonitoring of the spatial distribution of ms stars it is possible to reliablyidentify the ton in extragalactic star forming regions. compared to alternativemethods, this technique is complementary to the turn-off dating and avoids thesystematic biases affecting the pms phase. we describe the method and itsuncertainties, and apply it to the star forming region ngc346, which has beenextensively imaged with the hubble space telescope (hst). this study extendsthe lf approach in crowded extragalactic regions and opens the way for futurestudies with hst/wfc3, jwst and from the ground with adaptive optics.

1002.2074	on the delta v_hb_bump parameter in globular clusters	we present new empirical estimates of the delta v_hb_bump parameter for 15galactic globular clusters (ggcs) using accurate and homogeneous ground-basedoptical data. together with similar evaluations available in the literature, weended up with a sample of 62 ggcs covering a very broad range in metal content(-2.16&lt;=[m/h]&lt;=-0.58 dex). adopting the homogeneous metallicity scale providedeither by kraft &amp; ivans (2004) or by carretta et al.

1004.2559	on the stellar content of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present u,b,v,i photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based onmore than 4,000 ccd images. special attention was given to the photometriccalibration, and the precision for the b,v,i bands is better than 0.01 mag. wecompared in the v,b-v and v,b-i color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) carina withthree globular clusters (gcs, m53, m55, m79). we find that only the moremetal-poor gcs (m55, [fe/h]=-1.85; m53, [fe/h]=-2.02 dex) provide a good matchwith the carina giant branch. we performed a similar comparison in the v,v-icmd with three smc intermediate-age clusters (iacs, kron3, ngc339, lindsay38).we find that the color extent of the sgb of the two more metal-rich iacs(kron3, [fe/h]=-1.08; ngc339, [fe/h]=-1.36 dex) is smaller than the range amongcarina's intermediate-age stars. however, the ridge line of the more metal-pooriac (lindsay38, [fe/h]=-1.59 dex) agrees quite well with the carinaintermediate-age stars. these findings indicate that carina's old stellarpopulation is metal-poor and seems to have a limited spread in metallicity(delta [fe/h]=0.2--0.3 dex). carina intermediate-age stars can hardly be moremetal-rich than lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. we alsofind that the synthetic cmd constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported byobservations. the above results are at odds with recent spectroscopicinvestigations suggesting that carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity(delta [fe/h]~1--2 dex). we present a new method to estimate the metallicity ofcomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump andthe middle of the rr lyrae instability strip. the observed colors of carina'sevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agreesquite well with spectroscopic measurements.

1006.5217	on the absolute age of the globular cluster m92	we present precise and deep optical photometry of the globular m92. data werecollected in three different photometric systems: sloan digital sky survey(g',r',i',z'; megacam@cfht), johnson-kron-cousins (b, v, i; variousground-based telescopes) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) vegamag (f475w,f555w, f814w; hubble space telescope). special attention was given to thephotometric calibration, and the precision of the ground-based data isgenerally better than 0.01 mag. we computed a new set of {\alpha}-enhancedevolutionary models accounting for the gravitational settling of heavy elementsat fixed chemical composition ([{\alpha}/fe]=+0.3, [fe/h]=-2.32 dex, y=0.248).the isochrones -- assuming the same true distance modulus ({\mu}=14.74 mag),the same reddening (e(b-v)=0.025+-0.010 mag), and the same reddening law --account for the stellar distribution along the main sequence and the red giantbranch in different color-magnitude diagrams (i',g'-i' ; i',g'-r' ; i',g'-z' ;i,b-i ; f814w,f475w-f814w). the same outcome applies to the comparison betweenthe predicted zero-age-horizontal-branch (zahb) and the hb stars. we also founda cluster age of 11 +/- 1.5 gyr, in good agreement with previous estimates. theerror budget accounts for uncertainties in the input physics and thephotometry. to test the possible occurrence of cno-enhanced stars, we alsocomputed two sets of {\alpha}- and cno-enhanced (by a factor of three) modelsboth at fixed total metallicity ([m/h]=-2.10 dex) and at fixed iron abundance.we found that the isochrones based on the former set give the same cluster age(11 +/- 1.5 gyr) as the canonical {\alpha}-enhanced isochrones. the isochronesbased on the latter set also give a similar cluster age (10 +/- 1.5 gyr). theseindings support previous results concerning the weak sensitivity of clusterisochrones to cno-enhanced chemical mixtures.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1201.4074	morphological and spectral properties of the w51 region measured with  the magic telescopes	the w51 complex hosts the supernova remnant w51c which is known to interactwith the molecular clouds in the star forming region w51b. in addition, apossible pulsar wind nebula cxo j192318.5+140305 was found likely associatedwith the supernova remnant. gamma-ray emission from this region was discoveredby fermi/lat (between 0.2 and 50 gev) and h.e.s.s. (&gt;1 tev). the spatialdistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of theemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or themolecular cloud. however, the modeling of the spectral energy distributionpresented by the fermi/lat collaboration suggests a hadronic emissionmechanism. we performed observations of the w51 complex with the magictelescopes for more than 50 hours. the good angular resolution in the medium(few hundred gev) to high (above 1 tev) energies allow us to performmorphological studies. we detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gammarays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. we extend the spectrumfrom the highest fermi/lat energies to \sim 5 tev and find that it follows asingle power law with an index of 2.58 \pm 0.07stat \pm 0.22syst . the mainpart of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find afeature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. the possible contribution ofthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence onenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. the broad band spectralenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies protonacceleration above 100 tev. this result, together with the morphology of thesource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions inthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud. these results shedlight on the long-standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays.

1204.1872	rr-lyrae-type pulsations from a 0.26-solar-mass star in a binary system	rr lyrae pulsating stars have been extensively used as tracers of old stellarpopulations for the purpose of determining the ages of galaxies, and as toolsto measure distances to nearby galaxies. there was accordingly considerableinterest when the rr lyr star ogle-blg-rrlyr-02792 was found to be a member inan eclipsing binary system4, as the mass of the pulsator (hitherto constrainedonly by models) could be unambiguously determined. here we report thatrrlyr-02792 has a mass of 0.26 m_sun and therefore cannot be a classical rrlyrae star. through models we find that its properties are best explained bythe evolution of a close binary system that started with 1.4 m_sun and 0.8m_sun stars orbiting each other with an initial period of 2.9 days. massexchange over 5.4 gyr produced the observed system, which is now in a veryshort-lived phase where the physical properties of the pulsator happen to placeit in the same instability strip of the h-r diagram occupied by rr lyrae stars.we estimate that samples of rr lyr stars may contain a 0.2 percentcontamination with systems similar to this one, implying that distancesmeasured with rr lyrae stars should not be significantly affected by thesebinary interlopers.

1303.2063	an eclipsing binary distance to the large magellanic cloud accurate to 2  per cent	in the era of precision cosmology it is essential to determine the hubbleconstant with an accuracy of 3% or better. currently, its uncertainty isdominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the large magellanic cloud(lmc) which as the second nearest galaxy serves as the best anchor point of thecosmic distance scale. observations of eclipsing binaries offer a uniqueopportunity to precisely and accurately measure stellar parameters anddistances. the eclipsing binary method was previously applied to the lmc butthe accuracy of the distance results was hampered by the need to model thebright, early-type systems used in these studies. here, we present distancedeterminations to eight long-period, late- type eclipsing systems in the lmccomposed of cool giant stars. for such systems we can accurately measure boththe linear and angular sizes of their components and avoid the most importantproblems related to the hot early-type systems. our lmc distance derived fromthese systems is demonstrably accurate to 2.2 % (49.97 +/- 0.19 (statistical)+/- 1.11 (systematic) kpc) providing a firm base for a 3 % determination of thehubble constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 % in the future.

1304.7658	cumulative physical uncertainty in modern stellar models. ii. the  dependence on the chemical composition	we extend our work on the effects of the uncertainties on the main inputphysics for the evolution of low-mass stars. we analyse the dependence of thecumulative physical uncertainty affecting stellar tracks on the chemicalcomposition. we calculated more than 6000 stellar tracks and isochrones, withmetallicity ranging from z = 0.0001 to 0.02, by changing the following physicalinputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1h(p,nu e+)2h,14n(p,gamma)15o and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductiveopacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. theanalysis was performed using a latin hypercube sampling design. we examine in astatistical way the dependence on the variation of the physical inputs of theturn-off (to) luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time (t_h), theluminosity and the helium core mass at the red-giant branch (rgb) tip, and thezero age horizontal branch (zahb) luminosity in the rr lyrae region. for thestellar tracks, an increase from z = 0.0001 to z = 0.02 produces a cumulativephysical uncertainty in to luminosity from 0.028 dex to 0.017 dex, while theglobal uncertainty on t_h increases from 0.42 gyr to 1.08 gyr. for the rgb tip,the cumulative uncertainty on the luminosity is almost constant at 0.03 dex,whereas the one the helium core mass decreases from 0.0055 m_sun to 0.0035m_sun. the dependence of the zahb luminosity error is not monotonic with z, andit varies from a minimum of 0.036 dex at z = 0.0005 to a maximum of 0.047 dexat z = 0.0001. regarding stellar isochrones of 12 gyr, the cumulative physicaluncertainty on the predicted to luminosity and mass increases respectively from0.012 dex to 0.014 dex and from 0.0136 m_sun to 0.0186 m_sun. consequently, forages typical of galactic globular clusters, the uncertainty on the age inferredfrom the to luminosity increases from 325 myr to 415 myr.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.02620	accreting pre-main sequence models and abundance anomalies in globular  clusters	we investigated the possibility of producing helium enhanced stars inglobular clusters by accreting polluted matter during the pre-main sequencephase. we followed the evolution of two different classes of pre-main sequenceaccreting models, one which neglects and the other that takes into account theprotostellar evolution.  we analysed the dependence of the final central helium abundance, of thetracks position in the hr diagram and of the surface lithium abundanceevolution on the age at which the accretion of polluted material begins and onthe main physical parameters that govern the protostellar evolution. the lateris the beginning of the late accretion and the lower are both the centralhelium and the surface lithium abundances at the end of the accretion phase andin zams (zero age main sequence). in order to produce a relevant increase ofthe central helium content the accretion of polluted matter should start atages lower than 1 myr. the inclusion of the protostellar evolution has a strongimpact on the zams models too. the adoption of a very low seed mass (i.e. 0.001m$_{\odot}$) results in models with the lowest central helium and surfacelithium abundances. the higher is the accretion rate and the lower is the finalhelium content in the core and the residual surface lithium. in the worst case-- i.e. seed mass 0.001 m$_\odot$ and accretion rate $\ge 10^{-5}$ m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ -- the central helium is not increased at all and the surface lithiumis fully depleted in the first few million years.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0112307	the tricky galactic cluster ngc2420	we discuss the cm diagram of the galactic cluster ngc2420 to the light ofcurrent theoretical predictions. by relying on the most recent updating of thephysical input, one finds too luminous theoretical he burning stars togetherwith the evidence for a misfitting of the lower portion of the ms. moreover onefinds two well known overshooting signatures, as given by i) the largeextension of the "hook" preceding the overall contraction gap, and ii) thescarcity of stars just at the end of the gap. we show that the overluminosityof he burning stars appears as a constant prediction of models based on updatedphysics, whereas alternative assumptions about the equation of state canaccount for the ms fitting. moreover, due to the scarse statisticalsignificance of the observational sample, one finds that overshootingsignatures can be present also in canonical (without overshooting) predictions.we conclude that, unfortunately, ngc2420 does not keep the promise to be ofhelp in costraining the actual dimensions of convective cores in h burning msstars, suggesting in the meantime that using clumping he burning stars astheoretical standard candle is at least a risky procedure. in this context theneed for firmer constraints about the reddening of galactic clusters is shortlydiscussed.

astro-ph;0209045	calibration of white dwarf cooling sequences: theoretical uncertainty	white dwarf luminosities are powerful age indicators, whose calibrationshould be based on reliable models. we discuss the uncertainty of some chemicaland physical parameters and their influence on the age estimated by means ofwhite dwarf cooling sequences. models at the beginning of the white dwarfsequence have been obtained on the base of progenitor evolutionary trackscomputed starting from the zero age horizontal branch and for a typical halochemical composition (z=0.0001, y=0.23). the uncertainties due to nuclearreaction rates, convection, mass loss and initial chemical composition arediscussed. then, various cooling sequences for a typical white dwarf mass(m=0.6 mo) have been calculated under different assumptions on some inputphysics, namely: conductive opacity, contribution of the ion-electroninteraction to the free energy and microscopic diffusion. finally we presentthe evolution of white dwarfs having mass ranging between 0.5 and 0.9 mo. mucheffort has been spent to extend the equation of state down to the lowtemperature and high density regime. an analysis of the latest improvement inthe physics of white dwarf interiors is presented. we conclude that at thefaint end of the cooling sequence (log l/lo=-5.5) the present overalluncertainty on the age is of the order of 20%, which correspond to about 3 gyr.we suggest that this uncertainty could be substantially reduced by improvingour knowledge of the conductive opacity (especially in the partially degenerateregime) and by fixing the internal stratification of c and o.

astro-ph;0310646	on the age and mass function of the globular cluster m4: a different  interpretation of recent deep hst observations	very deep images of the galactic globular cluster m4 (ngc 6121) through thef606w and f814w filters were taken in 2001 with the wfpc2 on board the hst. afirst published analysis of this data set (richer et al. 2002) produced theresult that the age of m4 is 12.7 +/- 0.7 gyr (hansen et al. 2002), thussetting a robust lower limit to the age of the universe. in view of the greatastronomical importance of getting this number right, we have subjected thesame data set to the simplest possible photometric analysis that completelyavoids uncertain assumptions about the origin of the detected sources. thisanalysis clearly reveals both a thin main sequence, from which can be deducedthe deepest statistically complete mass function yet determined for a globularcluster, and a white dwarf (wd) sequence extending all the way down to the 5sigma detection limit at i~27. the wd sequence is abruptly terminated atexactly this limit as expected by detection statistics. using our most recenttheoretical wd models (prada moroni &amp; straniero 2002) to obtain the expected wdsequence for different ages in the observed bandpasses, we find that the dataso far obtained do not reach the peak of the wd luminosity function, thenceonly allowing one to set a lower limit to the age of m4 of ~9 gyr. thus, theproblem of determining the absolute age of a globular cluster and, therefore,the onset of gc formation with cosmologically significant accuracy remainscompletely open. only observations several magnitudes deeper than the limitobtained so far would allow one to approach this objective.

astro-ph;0604157	the effect of heavy element opacity on pre-main sequence li depletion	recent 3-d analysis of the solar spectrum data suggests a significant changeof the solar chemical composition. this may affect the temporal evolution ofthe surface abundance of light elements since the extension of the convectiveenvelope is largely affected by the internal opacity value. we analyse theinfluence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convectiveenvelope of pre-main sequence (pms) stars and thus on pms lithium depletion.the surface li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of severalprocesses, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paperthus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. focusing on pms evolution,where the largest amount of li burning occurs, we computed stellar models forthree selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 msun, with z=0.013, y=0.27, alpha=1.9)by varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution inz. we analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at thetemperatures and densities of interest for li depletion. several mixtures wereobtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;we then calculated the corresponding pms li abundance evolution. we found thata mixture variation does change the li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,the li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavierthan o.

astro-ph;0606026	hot flashers and he dwarfs in galactic globulars	we revisit the evolutionary scenario for hot flasher low-mass structures,where mass loss delays the he flash till the initial phases of their whitedwarf cooling sequence. our aim has been to test the theoretical resultsvis-a-vis different assumptions about the efficiency of mass loss. to thispurpose, we present evolutionary models covering a fine grid of masses, asobtained assuming a single episode of mass loss in a red giant model of 0.86 mowith z=0.0015. we find a reasonable agreement with previous evolutionaryinvestigations, showing that for the given metallicity late hot flashers arepredicted to cover the mass range m=0.4975 to m= 0.4845 mo, all models ignitingthe he-flash with a mass of the h-rich envelope as given by about me=0.00050.the ignition mechanism is discussed in some details, showing the occurrence ofa bifurcation in the evolutionary history of stellar structures at the lowermass limit for he ignition. below such a critical mass, the structures miss thehe ignition, cooling down as a hot flasher-manque' he white dwarfs we predictthat these structures will cool down, reaching the luminosity logl/lo=-1 in atime at the least five times longer than the corresponding cooling time of anormal co white dwarf. on very general grounds, one expects that old stellarclusters with a sizeable population of hot flasher should likely produce atleast a similar amount of slow-cooling he white dwarfs. according to thisresult, in a cluster where 20% of red giants escape the he burning phase, oneexpects roughly twice as white dwarfs than in a normal cluster where all redgiants undergo their he flash

astro-ph;0608654	recovering the star formation rate in the solar neighborhood	this paper develops a method for obtaining the star formation histories of amixed, resolved population through the use of color-magnitude diagrams (cmds).the method provides insight into the local star formation rate, analyzing theobservations of the hipparcos satellite through a comparison with syntheticcmds computed for different histories with an updated stellar evolutionlibrary. parallax and photometric uncertainties are included explicitly andcorrected using the bayesian richardson-lucy algorithm. we first describe ourverification studies using artificial data sets. from this sensitivity study,the critical factors determining the success of a recovery for a known starformation rate are a partial knowledge of the imf and the age-metallicityrelation, and sample contamination by clusters and moving groups (specialpopulations whose histories are different than that of the whole sample).unresolved binaries are less important impediments. we highlight how theselimit the method. for the real field sample, complete to mv &lt; 3.5, we find thatthe solar neighborhood star formation rate has a characteristic timescale forvariation of about 6 gyr, with a maximum activity close to 3 gyr ago. thesimilarity of this finding with column integrated star formation rates mayindicate a global origin, possibly a collision with a satellite galaxy. we alsodiscuss applications of this technique to general photometric surveys of othercomplex systems (e.g. local group dwarf galaxies) where the distances are wellknown.

astro-ph;0702405	white dwarf cooling sequences, ii: luminosity functions	given the importance of white dwarfs (wds) in many fields of modernastrophysics, the precise knowledge of the actual degree of accuracy of theassociated theoretical predictions is a primary task. in the first paper of aseries dedicated to the modeling of wd structure and evolution we discussed thelimits of the available theoretical studies of cooling sequences. in thepresent work we extend this analysis to isochrones and luminosity functions ofwds belonging to old stellar systems, like globular or old disk clusters. thediscussion is focused on the most common da, those with a co core and an h-richenvelope. we discuss, in particular, the variation of the age derived from theobserved wd sequence caused by different assumptions about the conductiveopacity as well as that induced by changing the carbon abundance in the core.the former causes a global uncertainty of the order of 10% and the latter ofabout 5%. we discuss different choices of the initial-to-final mass relation,which induces an uncertainty of 8% on the gc age estimate.

astro-ph;9911432	the puzzling theoretical predictions for the luminosity of clumping he  burning stars	this paper deals with theoretical predictions for he burning models in arange of masses covering the so-called red giant branch phase transition.taking as a guideline the observational constraints given by hipparcosparallaxes to the predicted luminosity of models originated from red giantprogenitors with he core undergoing electron degeneracy, we compare models byvarious authors as recently appeared in the literature, disclosing sensitivedifferences in the predicted luminosity. the solidity of these theoreticalpredictions is investigated by exploring the effects of varying the assumptionsabout the efficiency of core overshooting or the amount of mass loss, givingquantitative estimates of the related uncertainties. however, one finds thattheoretical predictions concerning the luminosity of the red giant clump in thehipparcos sample is scarcely affected by these mechanisms.a comparison amongtheoretical predictions as recently given by different authors convincinglydemonstrates that the different luminosity predictions are the natural resultsof evolutionary codes with different - but all reasonable- input physics. inthis context observations suggests that stellar models based on the mostupdated input physics are possibly overestimating the luminosity of thesestructures, raising doubts on several current predictions concerning theluminosity of hb stars in galactic globulars.
