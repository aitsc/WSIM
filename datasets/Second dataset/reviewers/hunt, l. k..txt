0902.0796	probing star formation at low metallicity: the radio emission of super  star clusters in sbs0335-052	we present high-resolution radio continuum observations of the nascentstarburst in the metal-poor galaxy sbs 0335-052. these radio data were takenwith the very large array and include observations at 0.7cm, 1.3cm, 2cm, 3.6cm,and 6cm. these observations enable us to probe the thermal radio nebulaeassociated with the extremely young star-forming regions in this galaxy. twodiscrete and luminous star-forming regions are detected in the south of thegalaxy that appear to be associated with massive star clusters previouslyidentified at optical wavelengths. however, the remaining optically-identifiedmassive star clusters are not clearly associated with radio emission (eitherthermal or non-thermal) down to the sensitivity limits of these radio data. thespectral energy distributions of the two radio-detected clusters are consistentwith being purely thermal, and the entire region has an inferred ionizing fluxof ~1.2 x 10^ 53 s^-1, which is equivalent to ~12,000 "typical" o-type stars(type o7.5 v). the observations presented here have resolved out a significantcontribution from diffuse non-thermal emission detected previously, implying aprevious episode of significant star formation. the current star formation rate(sfr) for this southern region alone is ~1.3 m_sun yr^-1, or ~ 23m_sun yr^-1kpc^-2. this sfr derived from thermal radio emission also suggests thatprevious optical recombination line studies are not detecting a significantfraction of the current star formation in sbs 0335-052. from model fits to theradio spectral energy distribution, we infer a global mean density in the twoyoungest clusters of n_e &gt; 10^3-10^4 cm^-3. in addition, a comparison betweenthe compact and diffuse radio emission indicates that up to ~50% of theionizing flux could be leaking out of the compact hii regions.

0906.2493	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): xii. the head-on collision  in ngc1961	we present high-resolution co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the liner 2 galaxyngc1961. this galaxy is unusual among late-type (sc) disk galaxies in having avery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. we propose a head-oncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both theoff-centered rings and the inflated radius. this scenario is supported by thedetection of a steep velocity gradient in the co(1-0) map at the position of asouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. this peak wouldrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. we use numerical models todemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. while ram pressure strippingcould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce thestriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group inx-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.the collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on thesouthern side. we argue that ngc1961 has a strongly warped disk, which givesthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually moreedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisinglyhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. in addition, theoutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. the collisionde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

0910.2804	the size--density relation of extragalactic hii regions	we investigate the size--density relation in extragalactic hii regions, withthe aim of understanding the role of dust and different physical conditions inthe ionized medium. first, we compiled several observational data sets forgalactic and extragalactic hii regions and confirm that extragalactic hiiregions follow the same size (d)--density (n) relation as galactic ones.motivated by the inability of static models to explain this, we then modelledthe evolution of the size--density relation of hii regions by considering theirstar formation history, the effects of dust, and pressure-driven expansion. theresults are compared with our sample data whose size and density span roughlysix orders of magnitude. we find that the extragalactic size--density relationdoes not result from an evolutionary sequence of hii regions but ratherreflects a sequence with different initial gas densities (``densityhierarchy''). moreover, the size of many hii regions is limited by dustabsorption of ionizing photons, rather than consumption by ionizing neutralhydrogen. dust extinction of ionizing photons is particularly severe over theentire lifetime of compact hii regions with typical gas densities of greaterthan 10^3 cm^{-3}. hence, as long as the number of ionizing photons is used totrace massive star formation, much star-formation activity could be missed.such compact dense environments, the ones most profoundly obscured by dust,have properties similar to ``maximum--intensity starbursts''. this implies thatsubmillimeter and infrared wavelengths may be necessary to accurately assessstar formation in these extreme conditions both locally and at high redshift.

0912.2015	star formation in m33: the radial and local relations with the gas	in the local group spiral galaxy m33, we investigate the correlation betweenthe star formation rate (sfr) surface density, sigma_sfr, and the gas densitysigma_gas (molecular, atomic, and total). we also explore whether there areother physical quantities, such as the hydrostatic pressure and dust opticaldepth, which establish a good correlation with sigma_sfr. we use the ha,far-ultraviolet (fuv), and bolometric emission maps to infer the sfr locally atdifferent spatial scales, and in radial bins using azimuthally averaged values.most of the local analysis is done using the highest spatial resolution allowedby gas surveys, 180 pc. the kennicutt-schmidt (ks) law, sigma_sfr \propto(sigma_gas)^n is analyzed by three statistical methods. at all spatial scales,with ha emission as a sfr tracer, the ks indices n are always steeper thanthose derived with the fuv and bolometric emissions. we attribute this to thelack of ha emission in low luminosity regions where most stars form in smallclusters with an incomplete initial mass function at their high mass end. forazimuthally averaged values the depletion timescale for the molecular gas isconstant, and the ks index is n_h2 = 1.1 +- 0.1. locally, at a spatialresolution of 180 pc, the correlation between sigma_sfr and sigma_gas isgenerally poor, even though it is tighter with the molecular and total gas thanwith the atomic gas alone. considering only positions where the co j=1-0 lineis above the 2-sigma detection threshold and taking into account uncertaintiesin sigma_h2 and sigma_sfr, we obtain a steeper ks index than obtained withradial averages: n_h2 = 2.22 +- 0.07 (for fuv and bolometric sfr tracers),flatter than that relative to the total gas (n_htot = 2.59 +- 0.05).

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1012.3073	the spitzer/irac view of black hole - bulge scaling relations	we present a mid-ir investigation of the scaling relations betweensupermassive black hole masses (mbh) and the structural parameters of the hostspheroids in local galaxies. the work is based on two-dimensional bulge-diskdecompositions of spitzer/irac 3.6 um images of 57 galaxies with mbh estimates.our estimates of effective radii (re) and surface brightnesses, combined withvelocity dispersions (sigma) from the literature, define a fp relationconsistent with previous determinations but doubling the observed range in re.none of our galaxies is an outlier of the fp, demonstrating the accuracy of ourbulge-disk decomposition which also allows us to independently identifypseudobulges in our sample. we calibrate m/l at 3.6 um by using the tightmdyn-lbul relation (~0.1 dex of rms) and find that no color corrections arerequired to estimate the stellar mass. the 3.6 um luminosity is thus the besttracer of mstar yet studied. we then explore the connection between mbh andbulge structural parameters (luminosity, mass, effective radius). we find tightcorrelations of mbh with both 3.6 um bulge luminosity and dynamical mass(mbh/mdyn~1/1000), with rms of ~0.35 dex, similar to the mbh-sigma relation.our results are consistent with previous determinations at shorter wavelengths.by using our calibrated m/l, we rescale mbh-lbul to obtain the mbh-mstarrelation, which can be used as the local reference for high-z studies whichprobe the cosmic evolution of mbh-galaxy relations and where the stellar massis inferred directly from luminosity measurements. the analysis of pseudobulgesshows that 4 out of 9 lie on the scaling relations within the observed scatter,while those with small mbh are significantly displaced. we explore thedifferent origins for such behavior, while considering the possibility ofnuclear morphological components not reproduced by our two-dimensionaldecomposition.

1101.2626	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) xiv. the barred liner/seyfert  2 galaxy ngc 3627	we present co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the interacting barred liner/seyfert 2galaxy ngc 3627 obtained with the iram interferometer at resolutions of 2.1" x1.3" and 0.9" x 0.6", respectively. the molecular gas emission shows a nuclearpeak, an elongated bar-like structure of ~18" (~900 pc) diameter in both comaps and, in co(1-0), a two-arm spiral feature from r~9" (~450 pc) to r~16"(~800 pc). the inner ~18" bar-like structure, with a north/south orientation(pa = 14{\deg}), forms two peaks at the extremes of this elongated emissionregion. the kinematics of the inner molecular gas shows signatures ofnon-circular motions associated both with the 18" bar-like structure and thespiral feature detected beyond it. the 1.6 micron h-band 2mass image of ngc3627 shows a stellar bar with a pa = -21{\deg}, different from the pa (=14{\deg}) of the co bar-like structure, indicating that the gas is leading thestellar bar. the torques computed with the hst-nicmos f160w image and our pdbimaps are negative down to the resolution limit of our images, ~60 pc inco(2-1). if the bar ends at ~3 kpc, coincident with corotation (cr), thetorques are negative between the cr of the bar and the nucleus, down to theresolution limit of our observations. this scenario is compatible with arecently-formed rapidly rotating bar which has had insufficient time to slowdown because of secular evolution, and thus has not yet formed an innerlindblad resonance (ilr). the presence of molecular gas inside the cr of theprimary bar, where we expect that the ilr will form, makes ngc 3627 a potentialsmoking gun of inner gas inflow. the gas is fueling the central region, and ina second step could fuel directly the active nucleus.

1105.4877	calibrating extinction-free star formation rate diagnostics with 33ghz  free-free emission in ngc6946	abridged: using free-free emission measured in the ka-band (26-40ghz) for 10star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy ngc6946, including its starburstingnucleus, we compare a number of sfr diagnostics that are typically consideredto be unaffected by interstellar extinction: i.e., non-thermal radio (i.e.,1.4ghz), total infrared (ir; 8-1000um), and warm dust (i.e., 24um) emission,along with the hybrid (obscured + unobscured) indicators of h\alpha+24um anduv+ir. the 33ghz free-free emission is assumed to provide the most accuratemeasure of the current sfr. among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the24um, h\alpha+24um and uv+ir sfr calibrations are in good agreement with the33ghz free-free sfrs. however, each of the sfr calibrations relying on someform of dust emission overestimate the nuclear sfr by a factor of ~2. this ismore likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation ofnon-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in thenucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. sfrcalibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which onlyagree with the free-free sfrs for the nucleus, and underestimate the sfrs fromthe extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. this result likelyarises from the cr electrons decaying within the starburst region withnegligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.finally, we find that the sfrs estimated using the total 33ghz emission agreewell with the free-free sfrs due to the large thermal fractions present atthese frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. thus,rest-frame 33ghz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the sfrsof galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radiodata to account for the non-thermal emission.

1210.4448	the herschel fornax cluster survey i: the bright galaxy sample	we present herschel observations of the fornax cluster at 100, 160, 250, 350and 500u with a spatial resolution of 7 - 36 arc sec (10" = 1 kpc atd_fornax=17.9 mpc). we define a sample of 11 bright galaxies, selected at 500u,directly comparable with our past work on virgo. we find good agreement withprevious observations made by iras and planck. the fir luminosity density ishigher (factor of three) in fornax compared to virgo. the 100u (42.5-122.5u)luminosity is two orders of magnitude larger in fornax than in the local fieldas measured by iras. using stellar (l_{0.4-2.5}) and fir (l_{100-500})luminosities we estimate a mean optical depth of tau=0.4+/-0.1 - the same valueas virgo. for 10 of the 11 galaxies (ngc1399 excepted) we fit a modifiedblackbody curve (beta=2.0) to the seds to derive dust masses and temperaturesof 10^{6.54-8.35} m_0 and t=14.6-24.2k respectively, comparable to virgo. thederived stars-to-gas(atomic) and gas(atomic)-to-dust ratios vary from 1.1-67.6and 9.8-436.5 respectively, again consistent with virgo. fornax is a massoverdensity in stars and dust of about 120 compared to the local field (30 forvirgo). fornax and virgo are both a factor of 6 lower over densities ingas(atomic) than in stars and dust indicating loss of gas, but not dust andstars, in the cluster environment. as the brightest fir source in either fornaxand virgo, ngc1365 is detected by planck. the planck data fit the pacs/spiresed out to 1382u with no evidence of other sources of emission ('spinningdust', free-free, synchrotron). at the opposite end of the scale ngc1399 isdetected only at 500$\mu$m with the emission probably arising from the nuclearradio source rather than inter-stellar dust.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1301.2621	how does star formation proceed in the circumnuclear starburst ring of  ngc 6951?	gas inflowing along stellar bars is often stalled at the location ofcircumnuclear rings, that form an effective reservoir for massive starformation and thus shape the central regions of galaxies. however, how exactlystar formation is proceeding within these circumnuclear starburst rings issubject of debate. two main scenarios for this process have been put forward:in the first the onset of star formation is regulated by the total amount ofgas present in the ring with star forming starting once a mass threshold hasreached in a `random' position within the ring like `popcorn'. in the secondstar formation preferentially takes place near the locations where the gasenters the ring. this scenario has been dubbed `pearls-on-a-string'. here wecombine new optical ifu data covering the full stellar bar with existingmulti-wavelength data to study in detail the 580 pc radius circumnuclearstarburst ring in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6951. using hst archival datatogether with sauron and oasis ifu data, we derive the ages and stellar massesof star clusters as well as the total stellar content of the central region.adding information on the molecular gas distribution, stellar and gaseousdynamics and extinction, we find that the circumnuclear ring in ngc 6951 is~1-1.5 gyr old and has been forming stars for most of that time. we seeevidence for preferred sites of star formation within the ring, consistent withthe `pearls-on-a-string' scenario, when focusing on the youngest stellarpopulations. due to the ring's longevity this signature is washed out whenolder stellar populations are included in the analysis.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1304.1541	star formation rates in resolved galaxies: calibrations with near and  far infrared data for ngc5055 and ngc6946	we use the near--infrared br\gamma hydrogen recombination line as a referencestar formation rate (sfr) indicator to test the validity and establish thecalibration of the {\it herschel} pacs 70 \mu m emission as a sfr tracer forsub--galactic regions in external galaxies. br\gamma offers the doubleadvantage of directly tracing ionizing photons and of being relativelyinsensitive to the effects of dust attenuation. for our first experiment, weuse archival cfht br\gamma and ks images of two nearby galaxies: ngc\,5055 andngc\,6946, which are also part of the {\it herschel} program kingfish (keyinsights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel). we use theextinction corrected br\gamma emission to derive the sfr(70) calibration forh{\sc ii} regions in these two galaxies. a comparison of the sfr(70)calibrations at different spatial scales, from 200 pc to the size of the wholegalaxy, reveals that about 50% of the total 70\mu m emission is due to dustheated by stellar populations that are unrelated to the current star formation.we use a simple model to qualitatively relate the increase of the sfr(70)calibration coefficient with decreasing region size to the star formationtimescale. we provide a calibration for an unbiased sfr indicator that combinesthe observed h\alpha with the 70 \mu m emission, also for use in h{\sc ii}regions. we briefly analyze the pacs 100 and 160 \mu m maps and find thatlonger wavelengths are not as good sfr indicators as 70\mu m, in agreement withprevious results. we find that the calibrations show about 50% differencebetween the two galaxies, possibly due to effects of inclination.

1305.2923	mapping dust through emission and absorption in nearby galaxies	dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxyproperties. however, the link between dust and attenuation is notstraightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the kingfish projectallows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivityand ~1 kpc resolution. we present here new optical integral field unitspectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pcscale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in boththe balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. the stellar continuumreddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the balmerdecrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that thedistribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dustcontent. the brightest hii regions are observed to be preferentially located industy regions, and we do find a correlation between the balmer line reddeningand the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, butwe also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution onscales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. wecaution against the use of integrated a_v measures to infer global dustproperties.

1309.0817	towards a removal of temperature dependencies from abundance  determinations	the metal content of a galaxy is a key property for distinguishing betweenviable galaxy evolutionary scenarios, and it strongly influences many of thephysical processes in the interstellar medium. an absolute and robustdetermination of extragalactic metallicities is essential in constrainingmodels of chemical enrichment and chemical evolution, however, current gasphase abundance determinations from optical fine-structure lines are uncertainto 0.8 dex as conversion of these optical line fluxes to abundances is stronglydependent on the electron temperature of the ionized gas. in contrast, thefar-ir emission lines can be used to derive an o++ abundance that is relativelyinsensitive to temperature, while the ratio of the optical to far-ir linesprovides a consistent temperature to be used in the derivation of an o$^+$abundance. we present observations of the [o iii] 88 \micron\ fine-structureline in ngc 628 that were obtained as part of the kingfish program. these dataare combined with optical ifu data to derive oxygen abundances for seven hiiregions. we find the abundance of these regions to all lie between the high andlow values of strong line calibrations and in agreement with estimates thatassume temperature fluctuations are present in the hii regions.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1312.0944	alma observations of cool dust in a low-metallicity starburst,  sbs0335-052	we present atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) cycle 0 band 7observations of an extremely metal-poor dwarf starburst galaxy in the localuniverse, sbs0335-052 (12+log(o/h)~7.2). with these observations, dust isdetected at 870micron (alma band 7), but 87% of the flux in this band is due tofree-free emission from the starburst. we have compiled a spectral energydistribution (sed) of sbs0335-052 that spans almost 6 orders of magnitude inwavelength and fit it with a spherical dust shell heated by a single-agestellar population; the best-fit model gives a dust mass of (3.8+/-0.6)x10^4msun. we have also constructed a sed including herschel archival data forizw18, another low-metallicity dwarf starburst (12+log(o/h)=7.17), and fit itwith a similar model to obtain a dust mass of (3.4+/-1.0)x10^2 msun. comparedwith their atomic gas mass, the dust mass of sbs0335-052 far exceeds theprediction of a linear trend of dust-to-gas mass ratio with metallicity, whileizw18 falls far below. we use gas scaling relations to assess a putativemissing gas component in both galaxies and find that the missing, possiblymolecular, gas in sbs0335-052 is a factor of 6 times higher than the valueinferred from the observed hi column density; in izw18 the missing component is4 times smaller. ultimately, despite their similarly low metallicity, thedifferences in gas and dust column densities in sbs0335-052 and izw18 suggestthat metal abundance does not uniquely define star-formation processes. at somelevel, self-shielding and the survival of molecules may depend just as much ongas and dust column density as on metallicity. the effects of low metallicitymay at least be partially compensated for by large column densities in theinterstellar medium.

1401.3693	dissecting the origin of the submillimeter emission in nearby galaxies  with herschel and laboca	we model the infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution of 11nearby galaxies of the kingfish sample using spitzer and herschel data andcompare model extrapolations at 870um (using different fitting techniques) withlaboca 870um observations. we investigate how the differences betweenpredictions and observations vary with model assumptions or environment. atglobal scales, we find that modified blackbody models using realistic coldemissivity indices (beta_c=2 or 1.5) are able to reproduce the 870um observedemission within the uncertainties for most of the sample. low values(beta_c&lt;1.3) would be required in ngc0337, ngc1512 and ngc7793. at localscales, we observe a systematic 870um excess when using beta_=2.0. thebeta_c=1.5 or the draine and li (2007) models can reconcile predictions withobservations in part of the disks. some of the remaining excesses occur towardsthe centres and can be partly or fully accounted for by non-dust contributionssuch as co(3-2) or, to a lesser extent, free-free or synchrotron emission. inthree non-barred galaxies, the remaining excesses rather occur in the diskoutskirts. this could be a sign of a flattening of the submm slope (anddecrease of the effective emissivity index) with radius in these objects.

1401.4120	alma reveals the feeding of the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 1566	we report alma observations of co(3-2) emission in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. our aim is to investigate themorphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclearfueling and feedback phenomena. ngc 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radiusand a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. the alma fieldof view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals amolecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300~pc in size, which iscontributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques.  the spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds upin a pseudo-ring at the inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the nuclear bar.  this is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seendriving the gas inwards inside the ilr ring of the nuclear bar. this phenomenonshows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influenceon the gas, triggering its fueling.  the gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen throughextinction in hst images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mmcontinuum. this continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heatedby the interstellar radiation field. the hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) lines weresimultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. the hco+(4-3) line is3 times stronger than the hcn(4-3), as expected when star formation excitationdominates over active galactic nucleus (agn) heating. the co(3-2)/hco+(4-3)integrated intensity ratio is \sim 100.  the molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slightnon-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. theseperturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor agn feedback is detected.

0802.2775	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): ix. the decoupled bars and  gas inflow in ngc 2782	we present co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the starburst/seyfert 1 galaxy ngc2782, obtained with the iram interferometer. the co emission is aligned alongthe stellar nuclear bar of radius 1 kpc, configured in an elongated structurewith two spiral arms at high pitch angle. at the extremity of the nuclear bar,the co changes direction to trace two more extended spiral features at a lowerpitch angle. these are the beginning of two straight dust lanes, which arealigned parallel to an oval distortion, reminiscent of a primary bar, almostperpendicular to the nuclear one. the two embedded bars appear in spitzer iracnear-infrared images, and hst color images, although highly obscured by dust inthe latter. we compute the torques exerted by the stellar bars on the gas, andfind systematically negative average torques down to the resolution limit ofthe images, providing evidence of gas inflow tantalizingly close to the nucleusof ngc 2782. the observations are well reproduced by numerical simulations,including gas dissipation, which predict the secondary bar decoupling, theformation of an elongated ring at the 1 kpc-radius inner lindblad resonance(ilr) of the primary bar, and the gas inflow to the ilr of the nuclear bar. thepresence of molecular gas inside the ilr of the primary bar, transported by asecond nuclear bar, is a potential ``smoking gun''; the gas there is certainlyfueling the central starburst, and in a second step could fuel directly theagn.

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1408.5076	herschel observations of gamma-ray burst host galaxies: implications for  the topology of the dusty interstellar medium	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are indisputably related to starformation, and their vast luminosity in gamma rays pin-points regions of starformation independent of galaxy mass. as such, grbs provide a unique tool forstudying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. most ofour understanding of the properties of grb hosts (grbhs) comes from optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relativelylittle knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resideswithin grbhs. currently ~20% of grbs show evidence of significant amounts ofdust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, andthese grbs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than grbswith optically bright afterglows. in this paper we present herschelobservations of five grbhs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted tounderstand the dust attenuation properties within grbs better. despite thesensitivity of our herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample wasdetected (grbh 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate (sfr)of ~100mstar/yr, and which had a relatively high stellar mass(log[mstar]=10.34+0.09/-0.04). nevertheless, when considering a larger sampleof grbhs observed with herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the onlyfactor contributing to a herschel detection, and significant dust extinctionalong the grb sightline (a_{v,grb}&gt;1.5~mag) appears to be a considerably bettertracer of grbhs with high dust mass. this suggests that the extinguishing dustalong the grb line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ism, andthus those grbs with a_{v,grb}&gt;1~mag but with no host galaxy herscheldetections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within anintervening dense cloud.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1409.7123	[cii] 158 $\mu$m emission as a star formation tracer	the [cii] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutralinterstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (sfr)tracer. using the herschel kingfish sample of 46 nearby galaxies, weinvestigate the relation of [cii] surface brightness and luminosity with sfr.we conclude that [cii] can be used for measurements of sfr on both global andkiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strongactive galactic nuclei (agn). the uncertainty of the $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. the main source ofscatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm ircolors, and we provide an adjustment based on ir color that reduces thescatter. we show that the color-adjusted $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$,holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-agn luminous infraredgalaxies. using [cii] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate sfrsuffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting sfr in luminousinfrared galaxies even after ir color adjustment (although this depends on thesfr measure employed). we suspect that surface brightness relations are betterbehaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closelyrelated to the local far-uv field strength, most likely the main parametercontrolling the efficiency of the conversion of far-uv radiation into gasheating. a simple model based on starburst99 population-synthesis code toconnect sfr to [cii] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normalgalaxies.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

0705.3662	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) vii. ngc4569, a large scale  bar funnelling gas into the nuclear region	this work is part of the nuga survey of co emission in nearby activegalaxies. we present observations of ngc4569, a member of the virgo cluster. weanalyse the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in the central region andwe investigate a possible link to the strong starburst present at the nucleus.70% of the 1.1x10^9 msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20" is foundto be concentrated within the inner 800 pc and is distributed along the largescale stellar bar seen in near-infrared observations. a hole in the codistribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the halpha emission andblue light are emitted. the kinematics are modelled in three different ways,ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. this approach allowsus to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy andeventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits ina barred potential. fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circularmotions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s).fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify withconfidence the single inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the large scale bar.finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in aweakly barred potential constrained by the ilr radius reproduces theobservations well. the mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed basedon the best fit model solution. the gravitational torques implied by this modelare able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ilr down to 300 pc, althoughanother mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

astro-ph;0404301	the role of dust in "active" and "passive" low-metallicity star  formation	we investigate the role of dust in star formation activity of extremelymetal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies (bcds). observations suggest that starformation in bcds occurs in two different regimes: "active" and "passive". the"active" bcds host super star clusters (sscs), and are characterised by compactsize, rich h2 content, large dust optical depth, and high dust temperature; the"passive" bcds are more diffuse with cooler dust, and lack sscs and largeamounts of h2. by treating physical processes concerning formation of stars anddust, we are able to simultaneously reproduce all the above properties of bothmodes of star formation (active and passive). we find that the differencebetween the two regimes can be understood through the variation of the"compactness" of the star-forming region: an "active" mode emerges if theregion is compact (with radius $\la 50$ pc) and dense (with gas number density$\ga 500$ cm$^{-3}$). the dust, supplied from type ii supernovae in a compactstar-forming region, effectively reprocesses the heating photons into theinfrared and induces a rapid h2 formation over a period of several myr. thisexplains the high infrared luminosity, high dust temperature, and large h2content of active bcds. moreover, the gas in "active" galaxies cools ($\la 300$k) on a few dynamical timescales, producing a "run-away" star formation episodebecause of the favourable (cool) conditions. the mild extinction and relativelylow molecular content of passive bcds can also be explained by the same modelif we assume a diffuse region (with radius $\ga 100$ pc and gas number density$\la 100$ cm$^{-3}$). we finally discuss primordial star formation inhigh-redshift galaxies in the context of the "active" and "passive" starformation scenario.

astro-ph;0408469	circumnuclear structure and black hole fueling: hst/nicmos imaging of  250 active and normal galaxies	why are the nuclei of some galaxies more active than others? if most galaxiesharbor a central massive black hole, the main difference is probably in howwell it is fueled by its surroundings. we investigate the hypothesis that sucha difference can be seen in the detailed circumnuclear morphologies of galaxiesusing several quantitatively defined features, including bars, isophotaltwists, boxy and disky isophotes, and strong non-axisymmetric features inunsharp masked images. these diagnostics are applied to 250 high-resolutionimages of galaxy centers obtained in the near-infrared with nicmos on hst. toguard against the influence of possible biases and selection effects, we havecarefully matched samples of seyfert 1, seyfert 2, liner, starburst and normalgalaxies in their basic properties, taking particular care to ensure that eachwas observed with a similar average scale (10-15 parsecs per pixel). severalmorphological differences among our five different spectroscopicclassifications emerge from the analysis. the hii/starburst galaxies show thestrongest deviations from smooth elliptical isophotes, while the normalgalaxies and liners have the least disturbed morphology. the seyfert 2 galaxieshave significantly more twisted isophotes than any other category, and theearly-type seyfert 2s are significantly more disturbed than the early-typeseyfert 1s. the morphological differences between seyfert 1s and 2s suggestthat more is at work than simply the viewing angle of the central engine. theymay correspond to different evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0409542	local supermassive black holes and relics of active galactic nuclei	we summarize a study where we test the hypothesis that local black holes (bh)are relics of agn activity. we compare the mass function of bhs in the localuniverse with that expected from agn relics, which are bhs grown entirely withmass accretion during agn phases. the local bh mass function (bhmf) isestimated by applying the well-known correlations between bh mass, bulgeluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocityfunctions. the density of bhs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5msun mpc-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuity equation with theonly assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive bhs and thatmerging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf at z=0 is generatedmainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense thatsmaller bhs (mbh&lt;10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) with respect to moremassive ones (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that the bhmf of agn relicsis perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating the local bhs weremainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtained while satisfying,at the same time, the constraints imposed by the x-ray background. thecomparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the merging process is notimportant in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts (z&lt;3). ouranalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local bhs grew during agn phasesin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencieseff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the eddingtonluminosity. the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.510^8 yr for mbh&lt;10^7 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0505128	improved templates for photometric redshifts of submm sources	there is growing evidence that some star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1 arecharacterized by high efficiencies and specific star formation rates. in thelocal universe, these traits are shared by ``active'' blue compact dwarfgalaxies (bcds) with compact and dense star-forming regions. the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of these bcds are dominated by young massive starclusters, embedded in a cocoon of dust. in this letter, we incorporate thesebcd seds as templates for two samples of high-redshift galaxy populationsselected at submm wavelengths. because of the severe absorption of the opticallight, the featureless mid-infrared spectrum, and the relatively flat radiocontinuum, the dusty star-cluster seds are good approximations to most of thesubmm sources in our samples. in most cases, the active bcd seds fit theobserved photometric points better than the ``standard'' templates, m 82 andarp 220, and predict photometric redshifts significantly closer to thespectroscopic ones. our results strongly suggest that the embedded dusty starclusters in bcd galaxies are superior to other local templates such as m 82 andarp 220 in fitting distant submm starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0507070	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): iv. gravitational torques  and agn feeding	we discuss the efficiency of stellar gravity torques as a mechanism toaccount for the feeding of the central engines of four low luminosity agn:ngc4321, ngc4826, ngc4579 and ngc6951. these galaxies have been observed aspart of the nuga co project, aimed at the study of agn fueling mechanisms. ourcalculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flowsand discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough todrain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. resultsindicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the agn: in thefour cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,resulting in no inflow on these scales. as a possible solution for the paradox,we speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smallerradii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.alternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ilr of the barsin these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitivein due time against gravity torques. we find that viscosity can counteractmoderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring ofhigh gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. we propose anevolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert toproduce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of anygalaxy. in this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectlyrelated to that of the bar instabilities.

astro-ph;0507403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) iii. the warped liner ngc3718	we present the first interferometric observations of co(1-0) and co(2-1) lineemission from the warped liner ngc3718, obtained with the iram pdbi. this l1.9galaxy has a prominent dust lane and on kpc scales, a strongly warped atomicand molecular gas disk. the molecular gas is closely associated with the dustlane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mmcontinuum agn. a comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fullycover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained iram 30m single dishco(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavilyresolved by the pdbi map. after applying a short-spacing correction with theiram 30m data, we find in total six main source components within the dustlane: one associated with the nucleus, four symmetrically positioned on eitherside at galactocentric distances of about 1.3kpc and 4.0kpc from the center,and a sixth on the western side at ~3kpc with only a very weak easterncounterpart. in the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, weinterpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbitalcrowding. we further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpcscales, but continues down to 250pc. besides the sixth feature on the westernside, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western onesindicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in ngc3718 that cannot beexplained by the warp. indications for a small scale asymmetry are also seen inthe central 600pc. these asymmetries might be evidence for a tidal interactionwith a companion galaxy (large scales) and gas accretion onto the nucleus(small scales). our study of ngc3718 is part of the nuga project that aims atinvestigating the different processes of gas accretion onto agn.

astro-ph;0609733	time evolution of the radio continuum of young starbursts: the  importance of synchrotron emission	we investigate the radio spectral energy distributions (seds) of youngstar-forming galaxies and how they evolve with time. the duration andluminosity of the nonthermal radio emission from supernova remnants (snrs) areconstrained by using the observational radio seds of sbs 0335-052 and i zw 18,which are the two lowest-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies in the nearbyuniverse. the typical radio ``fluence'' for snrs in sbs 0335-052, that is theradio energy emitted per snr over its radiative lifetime, is estimated to be$\sim 6$--$22\times 10^{22} {\rm w hz^{-1} yr}$ at 5 ghz. on the other hand,the radio fluence in i zw 18 is $\sim 1$--$3\times 10^{22} {\rm w hz^{-1} yr}$at 5 ghz. we discuss the origin of this variation and propose scaling relationsbetween synchrotron luminosity and gas density. we have also predicted the timedependence of the radio spectral index and of the spectrum itself, for both the``active'' (sbs 0335-052) and ``passive'' (i zw 18) cases. these models enableus to roughly age date and classify radio spectra of star-forming galaxies intoactive/passive classes. implications for high-z galaxy evolution are alsodiscussed.

astro-ph;9808168	the disks of galaxies with seyfert and starburst nuclei: ii.  near-infrared structural properties	we have derived the near-infrared structural components of a sample ofseyfert and starburst (sbn) host galaxies by fitting the images of hunt et al.(1997,apjs,108,229) with a new two-dimensional decomposition algorithm. ananalysis of the fitted parameters shows that seyfert 1 and sbn bulges resemblenormal early-type bulges in structure and color, with (j-k)^c_b about 0.1 magredder than disk (j-k)^c_d. seyfert 2 bulges, instead, are bluer than normalwith (j-k)^c_b ~ (j-k)^c_d. seyfert disks (especially type 1), but not those ofsbns, are abnormally bright (in surface brightness), significantly more so thaneven the brightest normal disks. seyfert disks are also compact, but similar tothose in normal early-type spirals. for a given mass, seyferts and especiallysbns are abnormally rich in neutral hydrogen, and there is strong, albeitindirect, evidence for lower mass-to-light (m/l) ratios in seyfert and sbndisks, but for normal m/ls in their bulges. in seyferts and sbns, hi massfractions and m/l ratios are anticorrelated, and we attribute the high gas massfractions and low m/ls in sbns and several seyferts to ongoing star formation.such abundant gas in seyferts would be expected to inhibit bar formation, whichmay explain why active galaxies are not always barred.

astro-ph;9901410	morphology of the 12-micron seyfert galaxies: i. hubble types, axial  ratios, bars, and rings	we have compared the morphological characteristics of the 891 galaxies in theextended 12-micron sample (e12gs), and assessed the effect of the 12-micronselection criterion on galaxy properties. the normal spirals in the e12gs havethe same axial ratios, morphological types, and bar and ring fractions as othernormal spirals. the hii/starburst galaxies have a higher incidence of bars, andmore than twice the normal rate of "peculiar" morphologies, both of which areattributable to relatively recent disturbances. the galaxies with active nuclei(agns: seyferts and liners) have the same incidence of bars as normal spirals,but show rings significantly more often than normal galaxies or starbursts. theliners have elevated rates of inner rings, while the seyferts have outer ringfractions several times those in normal galaxies. the different formation timesof bars and rings suggest an interpretation of these differences. bars formrelatively quickly, and indicate that material is recently being transported(by redistribution of angular momentum) to the center of the galaxy, where itis likely to trigger a short (e.g., $\lesssim 10^8$ yrs) burst of starformation. outer rings may result from similar disturbances, but require muchmore time to form, while inner rings form in a shorter time, more comparable tobars. thus it may be that after an interaction or instability triggers aninfall of gas, the galaxy in the earliest stage is likely to show enhanced starformation in its center, while later it is more likely to show liner activity,and still later likely to be a seyfert.
