0901.3934	transient low-mass x-ray binary populations in elliptical galaxies ngc  3379 and ngc 4278	we propose a physically motivated and self-consistent prescription for themodeling of transient neutron star (ns) low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)properties, such as duty cycle (dc), outburst duration and recurrence time. weapply this prescription to the population synthesis (ps) models of field lmxbspresented by fragos et al. (2008), and compare the transient lmxb population tothe chandra x-ray survey of the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 4278,which revealed several transient sources (brassington et al., 2008, 2009). weare able to exclude models with a constant dc for all transient systems, whilemodels with a variable dc based on the properties of each system are consistentwith the observed transient populations. we predict that the majority of theobserved transient sources in these two galaxies are lmxbs with red giantdonors. our comparison suggests that lmxbs formed through evolution ofprimordial field binaries are dominant in globular cluster (gc) poor ellipticalgalaxies, while they still have a significant contribution in gc rich ones.

0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0902.2343	comparing gc and field lmxbs in elliptical galaxies with deep chandra  and hubble data	(abridged) we present a statistical study of the low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)populations of three nearby, old elliptical galaxies: ngc 3379, ngc 4278, andngc 4697. with a cumulative ~1 ms chandra acis observing time, we detect 90-170lmxbs within the d25 ellipse of each galaxy. cross-correlating chandra x-raysources and hst optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (gc) lmxbs and112 field lmxbs. in the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (lx &lt; 5x 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of gc-lmxbs, when comparedwith field sources. using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we findthat the incompleteness-corrected x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) of gc andfield lmxbs differ at ~4# significance at lx &lt; 5 x 1037 erg s-1. as previouslyreported, these xlfs are consistent at higher luminosities. our observationsmay indicate a potential predominance of gc-lmxbs with donors evolved beyondthe main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficientformation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. thefield lmxb xlf can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus alocalized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-lawwith a similar low-luminosity break. this xlf may be explained withns-red-giant lmxbs, contributing to ~15% of total lmxbs population at ~5x1037erg s-1. the difference in the gc and field xlfs is consistent with differentorigins and/or evolutionary paths between the two lmxb populations, although afraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in gcs.

0706.3927	the x-ray binary population in m33: ii. x-ray spectra and variability	in this paper we investigate the x-ray spectra and x-ray spectral variabilityof compact x-ray sources for 3 chandra observations of the local group galaxym33. the observations are centered on the nucleus and the star forming regionngc 604. in the observations 261 sources have been detected. for a total of 43sources the number of net counts is above 100, sufficient for a more detailedspectral fitting. of these sources, 25 have been observed in more than oneobservation, allowing the study of spectral variability on ~months timescales.a quarter of the sources are found to be variable between observations.however, except for two foreground sources, no source is variable within anyobservation above the 99% confidence level. only six sources show significantspectral variability between observations. a comparison of n_h values with hiobservations shows that x-ray absorption values are consistent with galacticx-ray binaries and most sources in m33 are intrinsically absorbed. the patternof variability and the spectral parameters of these sources are consistent withthe m33 x-ray source population being dominated by x-ray binaries: two thirdsof the 43 bright sources have spectral and timing properties consistent withx-ray binaries; we also find two candidates for super-soft sources and twocandidates for quasi-soft sources.

0908.0268	agn/starburst connection in action: the half million second rgs spectrum  of ngc1365	we present a deep (~5.8 days) 0.3-2 kev high-resolution spectrum of ngc1365,collected with the reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) on board xmm-newton.the spectrum is dominated by strong recombination lines of he- and h-liketransitions from carbon to silicon, as well as by l transitions from fexvii.the continuum is strong, especially in the 10 to 20 angstrom, range. formalfits require two optically thin, collisionally ionised plasma components, withtemperatures ~300 and ~640 ev. however, they leave the bulk of the forbiddencomponents of the he-alpha ovii and nvi triplets unaccounted for. thesefeatures can be explained as being produced by photoionised gas. ngc1365 istherefore the first obscured agn, whose high-resolution x-ray spectrum requiresboth collisional ionisation and photoionisation. the relative weakness ofphotoionisation does not stem from the intrinsic weakness of its agn, whosex-ray luminosity is ~10^{42} erg/s. we suggest that it may instead come fromthe line-of-sight from the active nucleus to the nlr being blocked by opticallythick matter in the broad line region, at the same time responsible for thelarge observed variation of the column density obscuring the x-ray activenucleus. alternatively, ngc1365 could host a remarkably luminous nuclearstarburst when compared to the agn accretion power [abriged].

0909.0741	the luminosity function of x-ray sources in spiral galaxies	x-ray sources in spiral galaxies can be approximately classified into bulgeand disk populations. the bulge (or hard) sources have x-ray colors which areconsistent with low mass x-ray binaries (lmxb) but the the disk sources havesofter colors suggesting a different type of source. in this paper, we furtherstudy the properties of hard and soft sources by constructing color segregatedx-ray luminosity functions (xlf) for these two populations. since the number ofsources in any given galaxy is small, we coadded sources from a sample ofnearby, face-on spiral galaxies observed by chandra as a large project in cycle2. we use simulations to carefully correct the xlf for completeness. thecomposite hard source xlf is not consistent with a single power-law fit. atluminosities lx&gt;3e38 ergs/s it is well fit by a power law with a slope that isconsistent with that found for sources in elliptical galaxies by kim andfabbiano 2004. this is supports the suggestion that the hard sources aredominated by lmxbs. in contrast, the high luminosity xlf of soft sources has aslope similar to the ``universal'' high mass x-ray binary xlf. some of thesesources are stellar mass black-hole binaries accreting at high rates in athermal/steep power law state. the softest sources have inferred disktemperatures that are considerably lower than found in galactic black holesbinaries. these sources are not well understood, but some may be super-softultra-luminous x-ray sources in a quiescent state as suggested by soria et al2009.

0909.5444	the highest resolution chandra view of photoionization and jet-cloud  interaction in the nuclear region of ngc 4151	we report high resolution imaging of the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151 obtained with a 50 ks chandra hrc observation. the hrc image resolves theemission on spatial scales of 0.5", ~30 pc, showing an extended x-raymorphology overall consistent with the narrow line region (nlr) seen in opticalline emission. removal of the bright point-like nuclear source and imagedeconvolution techniques both reveal x-ray enhancements that closely match thesubstructures seen in the hubble space telescope [oiii] image and prominentknots in the radio jet. we find that most of the nlr clouds in ngc 4151 have[oiii] to soft x-ray ratio ~10, despite the distance of the clouds from thenucleus. this ratio is consistent with the values observed in nlrs of someseyfert 2 galaxies, which indicates a uniform ionization parameter even atlarge radii and a density decreasing as $r^{-2}$ as expected for a nuclear windscenario. the [oiii]/x-ray ratios at the location of radio knots show an excessof x-ray emission, suggesting shock heating in addition to photoionization. weexamine various mechanisms for the x-ray emission and find that, in contrast tojet-related x-ray emission in more powerful agn, the observed jet parameters inngc 4151 are inconsistent with synchrotron emission, synchrotron self-compton,inverse compton of cmb photons or galaxy optical light. instead, our resultsfavor thermal emission from the interaction between radio outflow and nlr gasclouds as the origin for the x-ray emission associated with the jet. thissupports previous claims that frequent jet-ism interaction may explain why jetsin seyfert galaxies appear small, slow, and thermally dominated, distinct fromthose kpc scale jets in the radio galaxies.

1003.3236	the x-ray spectra of the luminous lmxbs in ngc 3379: field and globular  cluster sources	from a deep multi-epoch chandra observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379we report the spectral properties of eight luminous lmxbs (lx&gt;1.2e38 erg/s). wealso present a set of spectral simulations, produced to aid the interpretationof low-count single-component spectral modeling. these simulations demonstratethat it is possible to infer the spectral states of x-ray binaries from thesesimple models and thereby constrain the properties of the source. of the eightlmxbs studied, three reside within globular clusters, and one is a confirmedfield source. due to the nature of the luminosity cut all sources are eitherneutron star binaries emitting at or above the eddington luminosity or blackhole binaries. the spectra from these sources are well described bysingle-component models, with parameters consistent with galactic lmxbobservations, where hard-state sources have a range in photon index of 1.5-1.9and thermally dominated sources have inner disc temperatures between ~0.7-1.55kev. the large variability observed in the brightest globular cluster source(lx&gt;4e38 erg/s) suggests the presence of a black hole binary. at its mostluminous this source is observed in a thermally dominated state with kt=1.5kev, consistent with a black hole mass of ~4 msol. this observation providesfurther evidence that globular clusters are able to retain such massivebinaries. we also observed a source transitioning from a bright state (lx~1e39erg/s), with prominent thermal and non-thermal components, to a less luminoushard state (lx=3.8e38 erg/s, gamma=1.85). in its high flux emission this sourceexhibits a cool-disc component of ~0.14 kev, similar to spectra observed insome ultraluminous x-ray sources. such a similarity indicates a possible linkbetween `normal' stellar mass black holes in a high accretion state and ulxs.

1003.6133	revisit short term x-ray spectral variability of ngc 4151 with chandra	we present new x-ray spectral data for the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 4151observed with chandra for 200 ks. a significant acis pileup is present,resulting in a non-linear count rate variation during the observation. withpileup corrected spectral fitting, we are able to recover the spectralparameters and find consistency with those derived from unpiled events in theacis readout streak and outer region from the bright nucleus. the absorptioncorrected 2-10 kev flux of the nucleus varied between 6e-11 and 1e-10 ergs^{-1} cm^{-2}. similar to earlier chandra studies of ngc 4151 at a historicallow state, the photon indices derived from the same absorbed power-law modelare \gamma~0.7-0.9. however, we show that \gamma is highly dependent on theadopted spectral models. fitting the power-law continuum with a comptonreflection component gives \gamma~1.1. by including passage of non-uniformx-ray obscuring clouds, we can reproduce the apparent flat spectral states with\gamma~1.7, typical for seyfert 1 agns. the same model also fits the hardspectra from previous asca "long look" observation of ngc 4151 in the lowestflux state. the spectral variability during our observation can be interpretedas variations in intrinsic soft continuum flux relative to a compton reflectioncomponent that is from distant cold material and constant on short time scale,or variations of partially covering absorber in the line of sight towards thenucleus. an ionized absorber model with ionization parameter \log\xi ~ 0.8-1.1can also fit the low-resolution acis spectra. if the partial covering model iscorrect, adopting a black hole mass m_{bh} ~ 4.6e+7 msun we constrain thedistance of the obscuring cloud from the central black hole to be r&lt;~9light-days, consistent with the size of broad emission line region of ngc 4151from optical reverberation mapping.

1004.3391	the energy spectrum of anomalous x-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray  repeaters	assuming that axps and sgrs accrete matter from a fallback disk, we attemptto explain both the soft and the hard x-ray emission as the result of theaccretion process. we also attempt to explain their radio emission or the lackof it. we test the hypothesis that the power-law, hard x-ray spectra areproduced in the accretion flow mainly by bulk-motion comptonization of softphotons emitted at the neutron star surface. fallback disk models invokesurface dipole magnetic fields of $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ g, which is what weassume here. unlike normal x-ray pulsars, for which the accretion rate ishighly super-eddington, the accretion rate is approximately eddington in axpsand sgrs and thus the bulk-motion comptonization operates efficiently. as anillustrative example we reproduce both the hard and the soft x-ray spectra ofaxp 4u 0142+61 well using the xspec package comptb. our model seems to explainboth the hard and the soft x-ray spectra of axps and sgrs, as well as theirradio emission or the lack of it, in a natural way. it might also explain theshort bursts observed in these sources. on the other hand, it cannot explainthe giant x-ray outbursts observed in sgrs, which may result from theconversion of magnetic energy in local multipole fields.

1006.4935	the optical counterpart to igr j06074+2205: a be/x-ray binary showing  disc loss and v/r variability	present x-ray missions are regularly discovering new x/gamma-ray sources. theidentification of the counterparts of these high-energy sources at otherwavelengths is important to determine their nature. in particular, opticalobservations are an essential tool in the study of x-ray binary populations inour galaxy. the main goal of this work is to determine the properties of theoptical counterpart to the integral source igr j06074+2205, and study itslong-term optical variability. although its nature as a high-mass x-ray binaryhas been suggested, little is known about its physical parameters. we have beenmonitoring igr j06074+2205 since 2006 in the optical band. we present opticalphotometric bvri and spectroscopic observations covering the wavelength band4000-7000 a. the blue spectra allow us to determine the spectral type andluminosity class of the optical companion; the red spectra, together with thephotometric magnitudes, were used to derive the colour excess e(b-v) andestimate the distance. we have carried out the first detailed optical study ofthe massive component in the high-mass x-ray binary igr j06074+2205. we findthat the optical counterpart is a v=12.3 b0.5ve star located at a distance of~4.5 kpc. the monitoring of the halpha line reveals v/r variability and anoverall decline of its equivalent width. the halpha line has been seen torevert from an emission to an absorption profile. we attribute this variabilityto global changes in the structure of the be star's circumstellar disc whicheventually led to the complete loss of the disc. the density perturbation thatgives rise to the v/r variability vanishes when the disc becomes too small.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1201.4171	studying the asymmetry of the gc population of ngc 4261	we present an analysis of the globular cluster (gc) population of theelliptical galaxy ngc 4261 based on hst wfpc2 data in the b, v and i bands. westudy the spatial distribution of the gcs in order to probe the anisotropy inthe azimuthal distribution of the discrete x-ray sources in the galaxy revealedby chandra images (zezas et al. 2003). the luminosity function of our gc sample(complete at the 90% level for v_mag = 23.8 mag) peaks at v_mag = 25.1(-0.6)(+1.0) mag, which corresponds to a distance consistent with previousmeasurements. the colour distribution can be interpreted as being thesuperposition of a blue and red gc component with average colours v-i = 1.01(-0.06)(+0.06) mag and 1.27 (-0.08)(+0.06) mag, respectively. this isconsistent with a bimodal colour distribution typical of elliptical galaxies.the red gc's radial profile is steeper than that of the galaxy surfacebrightness, while the profile of the blue subpopulation looks more consistentwith it. the most striking finding is the significant asymmetry in theazimuthal distribution of the gc population about a ne-sw direction. the lackof any obvious feature in the morphology of the galaxy suggests that theasymmetry could be the result of an interaction or a merger.

0710.5126	the dearth of low-luminosity globular cluster lmxbs in ngc 3379	our campaign of deep monitoring observations with {\it chandra} of the nearbyelliptical galaxy ngc 3379 has lead to the detection of nine globular cluster(gc) and 53 field low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in the joint {\ithubble}/{\it chandra} field of view of this galaxy. comparing thesepopulations, we find a highly significant lack of gc lmxbs at the low (0.3-8kev) x-ray luminosities (in the $\sim 10^{36}$ to $\sim 4\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ range) probed with our observations. this result conflicts with theproposition that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. this lack of low-luminositysources in gcs is consistent with continuous lmxb formation due to stellarinteractions and with the transition from persistent to transient lmxbs. theobserved cut-off x-ray luminosity favors a predominance of lmxbs withmain-sequence donors instead of ultra-compact binaries with white-dwarf donors;ultra-compacts could contribute significantly only if their disks are notaffected by x-ray irradiation. our results suggest that current theories ofmagnetic stellar wind braking may work rather better for the unevolvedcompanions of gc lmxbs than for field lmxbs and cataclysmic variables in thegalaxy, where these companions may be somewhat evolved.

1202.2358	probing the x-ray binary populations of the ring galaxy ngc 1291	we present chandra studies of the x-ray binary (xrb) populations in the bulgeand ring regions of the ring galaxy ngc 1291. we detect 169 x-ray point sourcesin the galaxy, 75 in the bulge and 71 in the ring, utilizing the four availablechandra observations totaling an effective exposure of 179 ks. we reportphotometric properties of these sources in a point-source catalog. there are~40% of the bulge sources and ~25% of the ring sources showing &gt;3\sigmalong-term variability in their x-ray count rate. the x-ray colors suggest thata significant fraction of the bulge (~75%) and ring (~65%) sources are likelylow-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). the spectra of the nuclear source indicatethat it is a low-luminosity agn with moderate obscuration; spectral variabilityis observed between individual observations. we construct 0.3-8.0 kev x-rayluminosity functions (xlfs) for the bulge and ring xrb populations, taking intoaccount the detection incompleteness and background agn contamination. we reach90% completeness limits of ~1.5\times10^{37} and ~2.2\times10^{37} erg/s forthe bulge and ring populations, respectively. both xlfs can be fit with abroken power-law model, and the shapes are consistent with those expected forpopulations dominated by lmxbs. we perform detailed population synthesismodeling of the xrb populations in ngc 1291, which suggests that the observedcombined xlf is dominated by an old lmxb population. we compare the bulge andring xrb populations, and argue that the ring xrbs are associated with ayounger stellar population than the bulge sources, based on the relativeoverdensity of x-ray sources in the ring, the generally harder x-ray color ofthe ring sources, the overabundance of luminous sources in the combined xlf,and the flatter shape of the ring xlf.

1203.3159	a period distribution of x-ray binaries observed in the central region  of m31 with chandra and hst	almost all galactic black hole binaries with low mass donor stars aretransient x-ray sources; we expect most of the x-ray transients observed inexternal galaxies to be black hole binaries also. obtaining period estimatesfor extra-galactic transients is challenging, but the resulting perioddistribution is an important tool for modeling the evolution history of thehost galaxy. we have obtained periods, or upper limits, for 12 transients inm31, using an updated relation between the optical and x-ray luminosities. wehave monitored the central region of m31 with chandra for the last ~12 years,and followed up promising transients with hst; 4\sigma b magnitude limits foroptical counterparts are ~26--29, depending on crowding. we obtain periodestimates for each transient for both neutron star and black hole accretors.periods range from &lt;0.4 to 490+/-90 hours (&lt;0.97 to &lt;175 hrs if all are bhsystems). these m31 transients appear to be somewhat skewed towards shorterperiods than the milky way (mw) transients; indeed, comparing the m31 and mwtransients with survival analysis techniques used to account for some data withonly upper limits yield probabilities of ~0.02--0.08 that the two populationsare drawn from the same distribution. we also checked for a correlation betweenorbital period and distance from the nucleus, finding a 12% probability of nocorrelation. further observations of m31 transients will strengthen theseresults.

1205.2845	new insights into the be/x-ray binary system mxb 0656-072	the x-ray transient mxb 0656-072 is a poorly studied member of high-massx-ray binaries. based on the transient nature of the x-ray emission, thedetection of pulsations, and the early-type companion, it has been classifiedas a be x-ray binary (be/xrb). however, the flaring activity covering a largefraction of a giant outburst is somehow peculiar. our goal is to investigatethe multiwavelength variability of the high-mass x-ray binary mxb 0656-072. wecarried out optical spectroscopy and analysed all rxte archive data, performinga detailed x-ray-colour, spectral, and timing analysis of both normal (type-i)and giant (type-ii) outbursts from mxb 0656-072 this is the first detailedanalysis of the optical counterpart in the classification region (4000-5000 a).from the strength and ratio of the elements and ions, we derive an o9.5vespectral type, in agreement with previous classification. this confirms its benature. the characterisation of the be/xrb system relies on balmer lines inemission in the optical spectra, long-term x-ray variability, and the orbitalperiod vs. spin period and ew(h\alpha) relation. the peculiar feature thatdistinguishes the type-ii outburst is flaring activity, which occurs during thewhole outburst peak, before a smoother decay. we interpret it in terms ofmagneto-hydrodynamic instability. colour and spectral analysis reveal ahardening of the spectrum as the flux increases. we explored the aperiodicx-ray variability of the system for the first time, finding a correlation ofthe central frequency and rms of the main timing component with luminosity,which extends up to a "saturation" flux of 1e-8 erg/cm^2/s. a correlationbetween timing and spectral parameters was also found, pointing to aninterconnection between the two physical regions responsible for bothphenomenologies.

(2009), tailored to our new chandrapointings of ngc 4278. we attribute this discrepancy to the ps assumption thatthe transient population is composed of ns xrbs, as well as differences betweenthe statistical analysis and error estimates used in the model and ourobservations.

1210.7185	modeling the redshift evolution of the normal galaxy x-ray luminosity  function	emission from x-ray binaries (xrbs) is a major component of the total x-rayluminosity of normal galaxies, so x-ray studies of high redshift galaxies allowus to probe the formation and evolution of x-ray binaries on very longtimescales. in this paper, we present results from large-scale populationsynthesis models of binary populations in galaxies from z = 0 to 20. we use asinput into our modeling the millennium ii cosmological simulation and theupdated semi-analytic galaxy catalog by guo et al. (2011) to self-consistentlyaccount for the star formation history (sfh) and metallicity evolution of eachgalaxy. we run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known fromprevious studies to affect the evolution of xrbs. we use our models andobservationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to createtheoretical galaxy x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) for several redshift bins.models with low ce efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeperimf exponent, and high stellar wind mass loss rates best match observationalresults from tzanavaris &amp; georgantopoulos (2008), though they significantlyunderproduce bright early-type and very bright (lx &gt; 10d41) late-type galaxies.these discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission andsfhs, agn contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed low-mass xrbs. in ourhighest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emissionfor most bright galaxies. we also find that the evolution of the normal galaxyx-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by xrbs in galaxieswith x-ray luminosities between 10d40 and 10d41 erg/s.

1211.2804	deep chandra monitoring observations of ngc 4649: i. catalog of source  properties	we present the x-ray source catalog for the chandra monitoring observationsof the elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649. the galaxy has been observed with chandraacis-s3 in six separate pointings, reaching a total exposure of 299 ks. thereare 501 x-ray sources detected in the 0.3-8.0 kev band in the mergedobservation or in one of the six individual observations; 399 sources arelocated within the d_25 ellipse. the observed 0.3-8.0 kev luminosities of these501 sources range from 9.3x10^{36} erg/s to 5.4x10^{39} erg/s. the 90%detection completeness limit within the d_25 ellipse is 5.5x10^{37} erg/s.based on the surface density of background active galactic nuclei (agns) anddetection completeness, we expect ~45 background agns among the catalog sources(~15 within the d_25 ellipse). there are nine sources with luminosities greaterthan 10^{39} erg/s, which are candidates for ultraluminous x-ray sources. thenuclear source of ngc 4649 is a low-luminosity agn, with an intrinsic 2.0-8.0kev x-ray luminosity of 1.5x10^{38} erg/s. the x-ray colors suggest that themajority of the catalog sources are low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). we findthat 164 of the 501 x-ray sources show long-term variability, indicating thatthey are accreting compact objects. we discover four transient candidates andanother four potential transients. we also identify 173 x-ray sources (141within the d_25 ellipse) that are associated with globular clusters (gcs) basedon hubble space telescope and ground-based data; these lmxbs tend to be hostedby red gcs. although ngc 4649 has a much larger population of x-ray sourcesthan the structurally similar early-type galaxies, ngc 3379 and ngc 4278, yetthe x-ray source properties are comparable in all three systems.

1212.1124	chandra observations of the collisional ring galaxy ngc 922	in this paper we report on chandra observations of the starburst galaxy ngc922. ngc 922 is a drop-through ring galaxy with an expanding ring of starformation, similar in many respects to the cartwheel galaxy. the cartwheelgalaxy is famous for hosting 12 ulx, most of which are in the star formingring. this is the largest number of ulx seen in a single system, and has led tospeculation that the low metallicity of the cartwheel (0.3 solar) may optimizethe conditions for ulx formation. in contrast, ngc 922 has metallicity nearsolar. the chandra observations reveal a population of bright x-ray sources,including 7 ulx. the number of ulx in ngc 922 and the cartwheel scales with thestar formation rate: we do not find any evidence for an excess of sources inthe cartwheel. simulations of the binary population in these galaxies suggestthat the ulx population in both systems is dominated by systems with strongwind accretion from supergiant donors onto direct-collapse bhs. the simulationscorrectly predict the ratio of the number of sources in ngc 922 and thecartwheel. thus it would appear that the the metallicity of the cartwheel isnot low enough to see a difference in the ulx population compared to ngc 922.

1212.5373	an accretion model for the anomalous x-ray pulsar 4u 0142+61	we propose that the quiescent emission of axps/sgrs is powered by accretionfrom a fallback disk, requiring magnetic dipole fields in the range10^{12}-10^{13} g, and that the luminous hard tails of their x-ray spectra areproduced by bulk-motion comptonization in the radiative shock near the bottomof the accretion column. this radiation escapes as a fan beam, which is partlyabsorbed by the polar cap photosphere, heating it up to relatively hightemperatures. the scattered component and the thermal emission from the polarcap form a polar beam. we test our model on the well-studied axp 4u 0142+61,whose energy-dependent pulse profiles show double peaks, which we ascribe tothe fan and polar beams. the temperature of the photosphere (kt~0.4 kev) isexplained by the heating effect. the scattered part forms a hard component inthe polar beam. we suggest that the observed high temperatures of the polarcaps of axps/sgrs, compared with other young neutron stars, are due to theheating by the fan beam. using beaming functions for the fan beam and the polarbeam and taking gravitational bending into account, we fit the energy-dependentpulse profiles and obtain the inclination angle and the angle between the spinaxis and the magnetic dipole axis, as well as the height of the radiative shockabove the stellar surface. we do not explain the high luminosity bursts, whichmay be produced by the classical magnetar mechanism operating in super-strongmultipole fields.

1405.2069	the x-ray luminosity functions of field low mass x-ray binaries in  early-type galaxies: evidence for a stellar age dependence	we present direct constraints on how the formation of low-mass x-ray binary(lmxb) populations in galactic fields depends on stellar age. in this pilotstudy, we utilize chandra and hubble space telescope (hst) data to detect andcharacterize the x-ray point source populations of three nearby early-typegalaxies: ngc 3115, 3379, and 3384. the luminosity-weighted stellar ages of oursample span 3-10 gyr. x-ray binary population synthesis models predict that thefield lmxbs associated with younger stellar populations should be more numerousand luminous per unit stellar mass than older populations due to the evolutionof lmxb donor star masses. crucially, the combination of deep chandra and hstobservations allows us to test directly this prediction by identifying andremoving counterparts to x-ray point sources that are unrelated to the fieldlmxb populations, including lmxbs that are formed dynamically in globularclusters, galactic stars, and background agn/galaxies. we find that the "young"early-type galaxy ngc 3384 (~2-5 gyr) has an excess of luminous field lmxbs(l_x &gt; (5-10) x 10^37 erg/s) per unit k-band luminosity (l_k; a proxy forstellar mass) than the "old" early-type galaxies ngc 3115 and 3379 (~8-10 gyr),which results in a factor of ~2-3 excess of lx/lk for ngc 3384. this result isconsistent with the x-ray binary population synthesis model predictions;however, our small galaxy sample size does not allow us to draw definitiveconclusions on the evolution field lmxbs in general. we discuss how futuresurveys of larger galaxy samples that combine deep chandra and hst data couldprovide a powerful new benchmark for calibrating x-ray binary populationsynthesis models.

1503.04819	spatial structures in the globular cluster distribution of the ten  brightest virgo galaxies	we report the discovery of significant localized structures in the projectedtwo-dimensional (2d) spatial distributions of the globular cluster (gc) systemsof the ten brightest galaxies in the virgo cluster. we use catalogs of gcsextracted from the hst acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) imaging data,complemented, when available, by additional archival acs data. these structureshave projected sizes ranging from $\sim\!5$ arcsec to few arc-minutes($\sim\!1$ to $\sim\!25$ kpc). their morphologies range from localized,circular, to coherent, complex shapes resembling arcs and streams. the largeststructures are preferentially aligned with the major axis of the host galaxy. afew relatively smaller structures follow the minor axis. differences in theshape and significance of the gc structures can be noticed by investigating thespatial distribution of gcs grouped by color and luminosity. the largestcoherent gc structures are located in low-density regions within the virgocluster. this trend is more evident in the red gc population, believed to formin mergers involving late-type galaxies. we suggest that gc over-densities maybe driven by either accretion of satellite galaxies, major dissipationlessmergers or wet dissipation mergers. we discuss caveats to these scenarios, andestimate the masses of the potential progenitors galaxies. these masses rangein the interval $10^{8.5}\!-\!10^{9.5}$ solar masses, larger than those of thelocal group dwarf galaxies.

1504.01398	studying the evolution of galaxies in compact groups over the past 3  gyr. i. the nuclear activity	we present the first -- of a series -- study of the evolution of galaxies incompact groups over the past 3 gyr. this paper focuses on the evolution of thenuclear activity and how it has been affected by the dense environment of thegroups. our analysis is based on the largest multiwavelength compact groupsample to-date, containing complete ultraviolet-to-infrared (uv-to-ir)photometry for 1,770 isolated groups (7,417 galaxies). we classified thenuclear activity of the galaxies based on optical emission line andmid-infrared diagnostic methods, as well as using spectral energy distributionfitting. we observe a 15% increase on the number of the agn-hosting late-typegalaxies found in dynamically old groups, over the past 3 gyr, accompanied bythe corresponding decrease of their circumnuclear star formation. comparing ourcompact group results with those of local isolated field and interacting pairgalaxies, we find no differences in the agn at the same redshift range. basedon both optical and mid-ir colour classifications, we report the absence ofseyfert 1 nuclei and we attribute this to the low accretion rates, caused bythe depletion of gas. we propose that the observed increase of liner andseyfert 2 nuclei (at low-z's), in the early-type galaxies of the dynamicallyyoung groups, is due to the morphological transformation of lenticular intoelliptical galaxies. finally, we show that at any given stellar mass, galaxiesfound in dynamically old groups are more likely to host an agn. our findingssuggest that the depletion of gas, due to past star formation and tidalstripping, is the major mechanism driving the evolution of the nuclear activityin compact groups of galaxies.

1505.00789	the 0.3-30 kev spectra of powerful starburst galaxies: nustar and  chandra observations of ngc 3256 and ngc 3310	we present nearly simultaneous chandra and nustar observations of twoactively star-forming galaxies within 50 mpc: ngc 3256 and ngc 3310. bothgalaxies are detected by both chandra and nustar, which together provide thefirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 kev. the x-rayemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by chandra; we find that hotgas dominates the e &lt; 1-3 kev emission while ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs)dominate at e &gt; 1-3 kev. the nustar galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies followsteep power-law distributions with gamma ~ 2.6 at e &gt; 5-7 kev, similar to thespectra of bright individual ulxs and other galaxies that have been studied bynustar. we find that both ngc 3256 and ngc 3310 have x-ray detected sourcescoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep nustar spectra of bothgalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity agn or non-agn innature (e.g., ulxs or crowded x-ray sources that reach l2-10 kev ~ 10^40 erg/scannot be ruled out). combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 kev spectra ofngc 3256 and ngc 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forminggalaxies m83 and ngc 253, we analyze the sfr-normalized spectra of thesestarburst galaxies. the spectra of all four galaxies show sharply decliningpower-law slopes above 3-6 kev due to ulx populations. our observationstherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,ulxs). this result is similar to the super-eddington accreting ulxs that havebeen studied individually in a targeted nustar ulx program. we also find thatngc 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of x-ray emission over the otherstar-forming galaxies. we argue that the excess is most likely explained by therelatively low metallicity of the young stellar population in ngc 3310.

astro-ph;0009211	chandra high-resolution camera observations of the luminous x-ray source  in the starburst galaxy m82	we have analyzed chandra high resolution camera observations of the starburstgalaxy m82, concentrating on the most luminous x-ray source. we find a positionfor the source of $\rm r.a. = 09^h 55^m 50^s.2, decl. = +69^{\circ} 40\arcmin46\arcsec.7$ (j2000) with a $1\sigma$ radial error of $0.7\arcsec$. theaccurate x-ray position shows that the luminous source is not at the dynamicalcentre of m82 nor coincident with any suggested radio agn candidate. the sourceis highly variable between observations, which suggests that the source is acompact object and not a supernova or remnant. there is no significant shortterm variability within the observations. dynamical friction and the off-centerposition place an upper bound of $10^{5} - 10^{6} m_{\odot}$ on the mass of theobject, depending on its age. the x-ray luminosity suggests a compact objectmass of at least $500 m_{\odot}$. thus, the luminous source in m82 mayrepresent a new class of compact object with a mass intermediate between thoseof stellar mass black hole candidates and supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0109198	chandra observations of the luminous ir galaxy ngc3256	we present a detailed analysis of high-resolution chandra observations of themerger system ngc3256, the most ir luminous galaxy in the nearby universe. thex-ray data show that several discrete sources embedded in complex diffuseemission contribute ~&gt;20 of the total emission (l_x^tot ~8e41 ergs/s in the0.5-10 kev energy range). the compact sources are hard and extremely bright andtheir emission is probably dominated by accretion driven processes. both galaxynuclei are detected with l_x ~3-10e40 ergs/s. no evidence is found for thepresence of an active nucleus in the southern nucleus, contrary to previousspeculation. once the discrete sources are removed, the diffuse component has asoft spectrum which can be modelled by the superposition of 3 thermal plasmacomponents with temperatures kt = 0.6, 0.9 and 3.9 kev. alternatively, thelatter component can be described as a power-law with index gamma ~3. someevidence is found for a radial gradient of the amount of absorption andtemperature of the diffuse component. we compare the x-ray emission withoptical, halpha and nicmos images of ngc3256 and find a good correlationbetween the inferred optical/near-ir and x-ray extinctions. although inversecompton scattering could be important in explaining the hard x-rays seen in thecompact sources associated with the nuclei, the observed diffuse emission isprobably of thermal origin. the observed x-ray characteristics support ascenario in which the powerful x-ray emission is driven solely by the currentepisode of star formation.

astro-ph;0203175	the x-ray source population of "the antennae" galaxies: x-ray properties  from chandra and multiwavelength associations	[abridged] we investigate the nature of the luminous x-ray source populationdetected in a (72 ks) chandra acis-s observation of ngc 4038/39, the antennaegalaxies. we derive the average x-ray spectral properties of sources indifferent luminosity ranges, and we correlate the x-ray positions with radio,ir, and optical hst data. the x-ray sources are predominantly associated withyoung stellar clusters, indicating that they belong to the young stellarpopulation. based on both their co-added x-ray spectrum, and on the lack ofassociated radio emission, we conclude that the ultra luminous x-ray sources(ulxs), with lx&gt;10^{39} erg\s, are not young compact supernova remnants (snr),but accretion binaries. while their spectrum is consistent with those of ulxsstudied in nearby galaxies, and interpreted as the counterparts of intermediatemass black-holes (m &gt;10-1000 \msun), comparison with the position ofstar-clusters suggests that some of the ulxs may be runaway binaries, thussuggesting lower-mass binary systems. the co-added spectrum of the sources inthe 3x10^{38}-10^{39} erg\s luminosity range is consistent with those ofgalactic black-hole candidates. these sources are also on average displacedfrom neighboring star clusters. the softer spectrum of the less luminoussources suggests the presence of snrs or of hot interstellar medium (ism) inthe chandra source extraction area. comparison with hi and co observationsshows that most sources are detected in the outskirts of large concentrationsof gas. the absorbing columns inferred from these observations would indeedabsorb x-rays up to 5 kev, so there may be several hidden x-ray sources.associated with these obscured regions we find 6 sources with heavily absorbedx-ray spectra and absorption-corrected luminosities in the ulx range.

0705.3977	new flaring of an ultraluminous x-ray source in ngc 1365	we have studied a highly variable ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) in thefornax galaxy ngc 1365, with a series of 12 chandra and xmm-newton observationsbetween 2002 and 2006. in 2006 april, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 kev band (similar to the maximum luminosity foundby asca in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. the x-rayspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. when thesource is seen at x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional softthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)contributes ~ 1/4 of the x-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute &lt; 10%of the flux. at the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detectedaround 0.5-2 kev; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. thepower-law is always hard, with a photon index gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter attimes), as is generally the case with bright ulxs. we speculate that thissource and perhaps most other bright ulxs are in a high/hard state: as theaccretion rate increases well above the eddington limit, more and more power isextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,and is used to power a comptonizing corona, jet or wind. the observed thermalcomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius betweenouter standard disk and comptonizing inner region moves further out and tolower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. this produces theobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. based on x-ray luminosity andspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass~ 50-150 msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).

astro-ph;0304554	a variable ultraluminous supersoft x-ray source in "the antennae":  stellar-mass black hole or white dwarf?	the chandra monitoring observations of the antennae (ngc 4038/39) have led tothe discovery of a variable, luminous, supersoft source (sss). this source isonly detected at energies below 2 kev and, in 2002 may, reached count ratescomparable to those of the nine ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) detected inthese galaxies. spectral fits of the sss data give acceptable results only fora $\sim$100--90 ev blackbody spectrum with an intrinsic absorption column of$n_{\rm h} \sim 2-3 \times 10^{21} \rm cm^{-2}$. for a distance of 19 mpc, thebest-fit observed luminosity increases from 1.7$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 1999december to 8.0$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 2002 may. the intrinsic,absorption-corrected best-fit luminosity reaches 1.4$\times 10^{40}$ \ergs in2002 may. the assumption of unbeamed emission would suggest a black hole of$\ga$100\msun. however, if the emission is blackbody at all times, as suggestedby the steep soft spectrum, the radiating area would have to vary by a factorof $\sim10^3$, inconsistent with gravitational energy release from within a fewschwarzschild radii of a black hole. viable explanations for the observedproperties of the sss are provided by anisotropic emission from either anaccreting nuclear-burning white dwarf or an accreting stellar-mass black hole.

astro-ph;0309467	comparing chandra and sirtf observations for obscured starbursts and agn  at high redshift	tracking the star formation rate to high redshifts requires knowledge of thecontribution from both optically visible and obscured sources. the dusty,optically-obscured galaxies can be located by x-ray and infrared surveys. toestablish criteria for selecting such sources based only on x-ray and infraredsurveys, we determine the ratio of infrared to x-ray brightness that would beobserved by sirtf and chandra for objects with the same spectral shapes asnearby starbursts if seen at high redshift. the parameter ir/x is defined asir/x = (flux density observed in sirtf mips 24 $\mu$m filter in mjy)/(totalflux observed within 0.5-2.0 kev in units of 10^-16 ergs\s\cm^2). based onobservations of ngc 4038/39 (``the antennae''), ngc 3690+ic 694 (arp 299 or mkn171), m 82, and arp 220, nine starburst regions are compared using mid-infraredspectra taken by the infrared space observatory (iso) and x-ray spectraobtained with chandra . the ir/x are determined as they would appear for 1&lt;z&lt;3.the mean ir/x over this redshift range is 1.3 and is not a significant functionof redshift or luminosity, indicating that sirtf surveys reaching 0.4 mjy at 24$\mu$m should detect the same starbursts as deep cxo surveys detect at a fluxof 0.3x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. the lower bound of ir/x for starbursts is about 0.2,suggesting that objects with ir/x smaller than this have an agn x-ray componentin addition to the starburst. values of ir/x for the obscured agn within ngc1068, the circinus galaxy, and ngc 6240 are also determined for comparisonalthough interpretation is complicated by the circumnuclear starbursts in thesegalaxies. any sources found in surveys having ir/x&gt;4 would not match any of theobjects considered.

astro-ph;0310200	x-ray binary populations: the luminosity function of ngc1569	using the population synthesis code startrack we construct the firstsynthetic x-ray binary populations for direct comparison with the x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of ngc 1569 observed with chandra.  our main goal is to examine whether it is possible to reproduce the xlf shapewith our models, given the current knowledge for the star-formation history ofthis starburst galaxy. we thus produce hybrid models meant to represent the twostellar populations: one old, metal-poor with continuous star-formation for 1.5gyr and another recent and metal-rich population. to examine the validity ofthe models we compare xlfs calculated for varying ages of the populations andvarying relative weights for the star-formation rates in the two populations.  we find that, for typical binary evolution parameters, it is indeed possibleto quite closely match the observed xlf shape.  the robust match is achieved for an age of the young population and a ratioof star formation rates in the two populations that are within factors of 1.5and 2, respectively, of those inferred from hst observations of ngc 1569.  in view of this encouraging first step, we discuss the implications of ourx-ray binary models and their potential as tools to study binary populations ingalaxies.
