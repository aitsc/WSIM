0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1005.2412	herschel-atlas: dust temperature and redshift distribution of spire and  pacs detected sources using submillimetre colours	we present colour-colour diagrams of detected sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field from 100 to 500 microns using both pacs and spire.we fit isothermal modified black bodies to the spectral energy distribution(sed) to extract the dust temperature of sources with counterparts in galaxyand mass assembly (gama) or sdss surveys with either a spectroscopic or aphotometric redshift. for a subsample of 330 sources detected in at least threefir bands with a significance greater than 3 $\sigma$, we find an average dusttemperature of $(28 \pm 8)$k. for sources with no known redshift, we populatethe colour-colour diagram with a large number of seds generated with a broadrange of dust temperatures and emissivity parameters, and compare to colours ofobserved sources to establish the redshift distribution of this sample. foranother subsample of 1686 sources with fluxes above 35 mjy at 350 microns anddetected at 250 and 500 microns with a significance greater than 3$\sigma$, wefind an average redshift of $2.2 \pm 0.6$.

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1106.1994	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the gama galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1)	using the complete gama-i survey covering ~142 sq. deg. to r=19.4, of which~47 sq. deg. is to r=19.8, we create the gama-i galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1),generated using a friends-of-friends (fof) based grouping algorithm. ouralgorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock gama lightcones,constructed from lambda-cdm n-body simulations populated with semi-analyticgalaxies. recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopersand are median unbiased in the most important respects. g3cv1 contains 14,388galaxy groups (with multiplicity &gt;= 2$), including 44,186 galaxies out of apossible 110,192 galaxies, implying ~40% of all galaxies are assigned to agroup. the similarities of the mock group catalogues and g3cv1 are multiple:global characteristics are in general well recovered. however, we do find anoticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in gama comparedto the mocks. additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatialcompleteness, g3cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with 5 or moremembers, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. thesetwo differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included ofthe current gama lightcone mock. further studies using a variety of galaxyformation models are required to confirm their exact origin.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.1636	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the mass-metallicity relationship	context: the mass-metallicity relationship (mmr) of star-forming galaxies iswell-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to itsexact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. aims: we measurethe mmr in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we compare our measuredmmr to that measured in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and study thedependence of the mmr on various selection criteria to identify potentialcauses for disparities seen in the literature. methods: we use strong emissionline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. we then apply a range ofselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in theinferred mmr. results: the shape and position of the mmr can differsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.after selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we findthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in gama is inreasonable agreement with that found in the sdss despite the difference in theluminosity range probed. conclusions: in view of the significant variations ofthe mmr brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteriaand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the mmr fromdifferent surveys and studies directly. we also conclude that there could be amodest level of evolution over 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.35 within the gama sample.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1302.4276	gama/h-atlas: linking the properties of sub-mm detected and undetected  early-type galaxies: i. z$\le$0.06 sample	we present two large, nearby (0.013$\le$z$\le$0.06) samples of early-typegalaxies (etgs): a visually classified sample of 220 etgs, created usingsource-matched data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) database withfir/sub-mm detections from $herschel$-atlas; and a visually classified sampleof 551 etgs which are undetected with $herschel$-atlas. active galactic nuclei(agn) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.these samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detectedversus undetected etgs. we find similarities in the stellar mass distributionsof the two etg samples but testing other properties uncovers significantdifferences. the sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentrationand s\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which maybe linked to the presence of dust in the former. optical and uv-optical coloursare also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recentstar formation. the intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times largerfor the sub-mm detected etgs. surface densities and groups data from the gamadatabase are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dustyetgs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty etgs in the nearby universe,although environments of the brightest etgs are shown to differ the least.modified planck functions are fit to the h-atlas detected pacs and spire fluxesfor etgs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$mspire band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of t$_{d}$=22.1k,with a range of 9-30k. the corresponding mean dust mass is1.8$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$, with a range of(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$. the dust masses calculated from thesefits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellarmass and bluer colours.

1304.3889	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the connection between metals,  specific-sfr, and hi gas in galaxies: the z-ssfr relation	we study the interplay between gas phase metallicity (z), specific starformation rate (ssfr) and neutral hydrogen gas (hi) for galaxies of differentstellar masses. our study uses spectroscopic data from gama and sdss starforming galaxies, as well as hi-detection from the alfalfa and gass publiccatalogues. we present a model based on the z-ssfr relation that shows that ata given stellar mass, depending on the amount of gas, galaxies will followopposite behaviours. low-mass galaxies with a large amount of gas will showhigh ssfr and low metallicities, while low-mass galaxies with small amounts ofgas will show lower ssfr and high metallicities. in contrast, massive galaxieswith a large amount of gas will show moderate ssfr and high metallicities,while massive galaxies with small amounts of gas will show low ssfr and lowmetallicities. using alfalfa and gass counterparts, we find that the amount ofgas is related to those drastic differences in z and ssfr for galaxies of asimilar stellar mass.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.1583	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): a deeper view of the mass, metallicity,  and sfr relationships	a full appreciation of the role played by gas metallicity (z), star-formationrate (sfr), and stellar mass is fundamental to understanding how galaxies formand evolve. the connections between these three parameters at differentredshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide importantconstraints for galaxy evolution models. using data from the sloan digital skysurvey-data release 7 (sdss-dr7) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)surveys we study the relationships and dependencies between sfr, z, and stellarmass, as well as the fundamental plane for star-forming galaxies. we combineboth surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ~ 0.36. thegama and sdss surveys complement each other when analyzing the relationshipsbetween sfr, mass and z. we present evidence for sfr and metallicity evolutionto z ~ 0.2. we study the dependencies between sfr, mass, z, and specificstar-formation rate (ssfr) on the m-z, m-sfr, m-ssfr, z-sfr, and z-ssfrrelations, finding strong correlations between all. based on thosedependencies, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the differentbehaviour observed between low and high mass galaxies. finally, our analysisallows us to confirm the existence of a fundamental plane, for which mass=f(z,sfr) in star-forming galaxies.

1306.2424	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): linking star formation histories and  stellar mass growth	we present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (m* &lt;10^10 msun) galaxies from observations within the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. for ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, we calculate starformation rates (sfr) and specific star formation rates (ssfr = sfr/m*) fromspectroscopic halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived frombalmer decrements. we find a dependence of ssfr on stellar mass, such thatssfrs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and forthe full sample, ssfrs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. we usesimple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories toinvestigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale andthe formation redshift. we find that parametrizations previously fit to samplesof z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of ssfrs and stellar massesobserved in the gama sample between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32. in particular, a large numberof low-mass (m* &lt; 10^10 msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher ssfrsthan can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. for such alarge number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such highssfrs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining sfhwith stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.

1306.5752	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): witnessing the assembly of the cluster  abell 1882	we present a combined optical and x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abell1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding therecent assembly history of this system. our optical data consist of spectradrawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, which lends itself tothis kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopiccompleteness. we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detectand characterize substructure. we complement the optical data with x-ray datataken with both chandra and xmm. our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors twomain components, a1882a and a1882b, which have a projected separation of 2mpcand a line of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. the primarysystem, a1882a, has velocity dispersion sigma_v=500km/s and chandra (xmm)temperature kt=3.57kev (3.31kev) while the secondary, a1882b, hassigma_v=457km/s and chandra (xmm) temperature kt=2.39kev (2.12kev). the opticaland x-ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within theuncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a(m_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}msolar) when compared with a1882b(m_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}msolar). we interpret the a1882a/a1882b system as beingobserved prior to a core passage. supporting this interpretation is the largeprojected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for arecent (&lt;2gyr) major interaction in the x-ray data. two-body analyses indicatethat a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutionsstrongly favored. we compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for thespectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers ofa1882a and a1882b, respectively. these blue fractions do not differsignificantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusterswith similar mass and redshift.

1308.2985	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): resolving the role of environment in  galaxy evolution	we present observations of 18 galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey made with the spiral optical integral field unit (ifu) on theanglo-australian telescope. the galaxies are selected to have a narrow range instellar mass (6x10^9msolar &lt; m* &lt;2x10^10 msolar) in order to focus on theeffects of environment. local galaxy environments are measured quantitativelyusing 5th nearest neighbour surface densities. we find that the total starformation rates (sfr) measured from the ifu data are consistent with total sfrsmeasured from aperture correcting either gama or sloan digital sky surveysingle-fibre observations. the mean differences are sfr_gama/sfr_ifu =1.26+/-0.23, sigma=0.90 and for the sloan digital sky survey we similarly findsfr_brinchmann/sfr_ifu = 1.34+/-0.17, sigma=0.67. examining the relationshipswith environment, we find off-centre and clumpy halpha emission is notsignificantly dependent on environment, being present in 2/7 (29^+20_-11 percent) galaxies in high-density environments (&gt;0.77 mpc^-2), and 5/11(45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (&lt;0.77 mpc^-2). wefind a weak but not significant relationship of the total star formation ratesof star-forming galaxies with environment. due to the size of our sample andthe scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possiblesfr dependence on environment. examining the spatial distribution of the halphaemission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radialprofile of star-forming galaxies with environment. if these observations areborne out in larger samples this would infer that any environment-drivenstar-formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the`infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependentmanner (an `in-situ evolution' model).

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

1411.2557	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): bivariate functions of h$\alpha$ star  forming galaxies	we present bivariate luminosity and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$ starforming galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. whileoptically deep spectroscopic observations of gama over a wide sky area enablethe detection of a large number of $0.001&lt;{sfr}_{h\alpha}$ (m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$)$&lt;100$ galaxies, the requirement for an h$\alpha$ detection intargets selected from an $r$-band magnitude limited survey leads to anincompleteness due to missing optically faint star forming galaxies. using$z&lt;0.1$ bivariate distributions as a reference we model the higher-$z$distributions, thereby approximating a correction for the missing opticallyfaint star forming galaxies to the local sfr and stellar mass densities.furthermore, we obtain the $r$-band lfs and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$star forming galaxies from the bivariate lfs. as our sample is selected on thebasis of detected h$\alpha$ emission, a direct tracer of on-going starformation, this sample represents a true star forming galaxy sample, and isdrawn from both photometrically classified blue and red sub-populations, thoughmostly from the blue population. on average 20-30% of red galaxies at allstellar masses are star forming, implying that these galaxies may be dusty starforming systems.

1412.2141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy luminosity function within  the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on geometricenvironment within the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. the tidal tensorprescription, based on the hessian of the pseudo-gravitational potential, isused to classify the cosmic web and define the geometric environments: for agiven smoothing scale, we classify every position of the surveyed region,$0.04&lt;{z}&lt;0.26$, as either a void, a sheet, a filament or a knot. we considerhow to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the hessian in orderto partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. we find asignificant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between differentgeometric environments; the normalisation, characterised by $\phi^{*}$ in aschechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots.the turnover magnitude, characterised by $m^*$, brightens by approximately$0.5$ mag from voids to knots. however, we show that the observed modulationcan be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. wetherefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on thegalaxy luminosity function.

1507.07588	new hi 21-cm absorbers at low and intermediate redshifts	we present the results of a survey for intervening hi 21-cm absorbers atintermediate and low redshift (0&lt;z&lt;1.2). for our total sample of 24 systems, weobtained high quality data for 17 systems, the other seven being severelyaffected by radio frequency interference (rfi). five of our targets are lowredshift (z&lt;0.17) optical galaxies with small impact parameters (&lt;20 kpc)toward radio-bright background sources. two of these were detected in 21-cmabsorption, showing narrow, high optical depth absorption profiles, thenarrowest having a velocity dispersion of only 1.5 km/s, which puts an upperlimit on the kinetic temperature of t_k&lt;270 k. combining our observations withresults from the literature, we measure a weak anti-correlation between impactparameter and integral optical depth in local (z&lt;0.5) 21-cm absorbers. ofeleven caii and mgii systems searched, two were detected in 21-cm absorption,and six were affected by rfi to a level that precludes a detection. for thesetwo systems at z~0.6 we measure spin temperatures of t_s=(65+/-17) k andt_s&gt;180 k. a subset of our systems were also searched for oh absorption, but nodetections were made.

0705.2528	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the connection between close pairs and  asymmetry; implications for the galaxy merger rate	we compare the use of galaxy asymmetry and pair proximity for measuringgalaxy merger fractions and rates for a volume limited sample of 3184 galaxieswith -21 &lt; m(b) -5 log h &lt; -18 mag. and 0.010 &lt; z &lt; 0.123 drawn from themillennium galaxy catalogue. our findings are that:  (i) galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolatedgalaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. at least 35%of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc andvelocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry andare therefore likely to be physically bound.  (ii) among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are eitherinteracting systems or merger remnants. however, a significant fraction ofgalaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars orare fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. merger rates calculated viaasymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sourcesof contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.  (iii) close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods ofmeasuring the merger rate. galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries aresensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.  (iv) the merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetriesis about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}.these results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (dependingon the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate withredshift up to z ~1.

1508.06186	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the bright void galaxy population in  the optical and mid-ir	we examine the properties of galaxies in the galaxies and mass assembly(gama) survey located in voids with radii $&gt;10~h^{-1}$ mpc. utilising the gamaequatorial survey, 592 void galaxies are identified out to z~0.1 brighter than$m_{r} = -18.4$, our magnitude completeness limit. using the $w_{\rm{h\alpha}}$vs. [nii]/h$\alpha$ (whan) line strength diagnostic diagram, we classify theirspectra as star forming, agn, or dominated by old stellar populations. forobjects more massive than $5\times10^{9}$ m$_{\odot}$, we identify a sample of26 void galaxies with old stellar populations classed as passive and retiredgalaxies in the whan diagnostic diagram, else they lack any emission lines intheir spectra. when matched to wise mid-ir photometry, these passive andretired galaxies exhibit a range of mid-ir colour, with a number of voidgalaxies exhibiting [4.6]-[12] colours inconsistent with completely quenchedstellar populations, with a similar spread in colour seen for a randomly drawnnon-void comparison sample. we hypothesise that a number of these galaxies hostobscured star formation, else they are star forming outside of their centralregions targeted for single fibre spectroscopy. when matched to a randomlydrawn sample of non-void galaxies, the void and non-void galaxies exhibitsimilar properties in terms of optical and mid-ir colour, morphology, and starformation activity, suggesting comparable mass assembly and quenchinghistories. a trend in mid-ir [4.6]-[12] colour is seen, such that both void andnon-void galaxies with quenched/passive colours &lt;1.5 typically have masseshigher than $10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, where internally driven processes play anincreasingly important role in galaxy evolution.

1509.02159	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): projected galaxy clustering	we measure the projected 2-point correlation function of galaxies in the 180deg$^2$ equatorial regions of the gama ii survey, for four different redshiftslices between z = 0.0 and z=0.5. to do this we further develop the cole (2011)method of producing suitable random catalogues for the calculation ofcorrelation functions. we find that more r-band luminous, more massive andredder galaxies are more clustered. we also find that red galaxies havestronger clustering on scales less than ~3 $h^{-1}$ mpc. we compare to twodifferent versions of the galform galaxy formation model, lacey et al (inprep.) and gonzalez-perez et al. (2014), and find that the models reproduce thetrend of stronger clustering for more massive galaxies. however, the modelsunder predict the clustering of blue galaxies, can incorrectly predict thecorrelation function on small scales and under predict the clustering in oursample of galaxies with ~3$l_r$ . we suggest possible avenues to explore toimprove these cluster- ing predictions. the measurements presented in thispaper can be used to test other galaxy formation models, and we make themeasurements available online to facilitate this.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

1512.04264	the xxl survey. ii. the bright cluster sample: catalogue and luminosity  function	context. the xxl survey is the largest survey carried out by the xmm-newtonsatellite and covers a total area of 50 square degrees distributed over twofields. it primarily aims at investigating the large-scale structures of theuniverse using the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nucleias tracers of the matter distribution.  aims. this article presents the xxl bright cluster sample, a subsample of 100galaxy clusters selected from the full xxl catalogue by setting a lower limitof $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{erg \,s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$ on the source flux within a1$^{\prime}$ aperture.  methods. the selection function was estimated using a mixture of monte carlosimulations and analytical recipes that closely reproduce the source selectionprocess. an extensive spectroscopic follow-up provided redshifts for 97 of the100 clusters. we derived accurate x-ray parameters for all the sources. scalingrelations were self-consistently derived from the same sample in otherpublications of the series. on this basis, we study the number density,luminosity function, and spatial distribution of the sample.  results. the bright cluster sample consists of systems with masses between$m_{500}=7\times 10^{13}$ and $3\times 10^{14} m_\odot$, mostly located between$z=0.1$ and 0.5. the observed sky density of clusters is slightly below thepredictions from the wmap9 model, and significantly below the predictions fromthe planck 2015 cosmology. in general, within the current uncertainties of thecluster mass calibration, models with higher values of $\sigma_8$ and/or$\omega_m$ appear more difficult to accommodate. we provide tight constraintson the cluster differential luminosity function and find no hint of evolutionout to $z\sim1$. we also find strong evidence for the presence of large-scalestructures in the xxl bright cluster sample and identify five newsuperclusters.

astro-ph;0108239	the proximity effect in a close group of qsos	we present an analysis of the proximity effect in a sample of ten 2 aresolution qso spectra of the ly alpha forest at &lt;z&gt; = 2.9. rather thaninvestigating variations in the number density of individual absorption lineswe employ a novel technique that is based on the statistics of the transmittedflux itself. we confirm the existence of the proximity effect at the &gt; 99 percent confidence level. we derive a value for the mean intensity of theextragalactic background radiation at the lyman limit of j = 3.5^{+3.5}_{-1.3}x 10^{-22} ergs/s/cm^2/hz/sr. this value assumes that qso redshifts measuredfrom high ionization lines differ from the true systemic redshifts by ~800km/s. we find evidence at a level of 2.6 sigma that the significance of theproximity effect is correlated with qso lyman limit luminosity. allowing forknown qso variability the significance of the correlation reduces to 2.1 sigma.the qsos form a close group on the sky and the sample is thus well suited foran investigation of the foreground proximity effect, where the ly alpha forestof a background qso is influenced by the uv radiation from a nearby foregroundqso. from the complete sample we find no evidence for the existence of thiseffect, implying either that j &gt; 20 x 10^{-22} ergs/s/cm^2/hz/sr or that qsosemit at least a factor of 1.4 less ionizing radiation in the plane of the skythan along the line of sight to earth. we do however find one counter-example.our sample includes the fortunate constellation of a foreground qso surroundedby four nearby background qsos. these four spectra all show underdenseabsorption within +/-3000 km/s of the redshift of the foreground qso.

astro-ph;0207555	the millennium galaxy catalogue: 16 &lt; b_mgc &lt; 24 galaxy counts and the  calibration of the local galaxy luminosity function	the millennium galaxy catalogue (mgc) is a 37.5 deg^2, medium-deep, b-bandimaging survey along the celestial equator, taken with the wide field camera onthe isaac newton telescope. the survey region is contained within the regionsof both the two degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and the sloandigital sky survey early data release (sdss-edr). the survey has a uniformisophotal detection limit of 26 mag arcsec^-2 and it provides a robust,well-defined catalogue of stars and galaxies in the range 16 &lt;= b_mgc &lt; 24 mag.  here we describe the survey strategy, the photometric and astrometriccalibration, source detection and analysis, and present the galaxy numbercounts that connect the bright and faint galaxy populations within a singlesurvey. we argue that these counts represent the state of the art and use themto constrain the normalizations (phi*) of a number of recent estimates of thelocal galaxy luminosity function. we find that the 2dfgrs, sdss commissioningdata (cd), eso slice project, century survey, durham/ukst, mt stromlo/apm,ssrs2, and nog luminosity functions require a revision of their published phi*values by factors of 1.05 +/- 0.05, 0.76 +/- 0.10, 1.02 +/- 0.22, 1.02 +/-0.16, 1.16 +/- 0.28, 1.75 +/- 0.37, 1.40 +/- 0.26 and 1.01 +/- 0.39,respectively. after renormalizing the galaxy luminosity functions we find amean local $\bj$ luminosity density of j_{b_j} = (1.986 +/- 0.031) x 10^8 hl_{\odot} mpc^-3.

astro-ph;0506635	the millennium galaxy catalogue: dynamically close galaxy pairs and the  global merger rate	we derive the number of dynamically close companions per galaxy ($n_c$) andtheir total luminosity ($l_c$) for galaxies in the millennium galaxy catalogue:$n_c$ is similar to the fraction of galaxies in close pairs and is directlyrelated to the galaxy merger rate. we find $n_c=0.0174 \pm 0.0015$ and$l_c=(252 \pm 30) \times 10^6$ $l_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-22 &lt; m_b -5 \logh &lt; -19$ with $&lt;z&gt;=0.123$ and $n_c=0.0357 \pm 0.0027$, $l_c= (294 \pm 31)\times 10^6 l_{\odot}$ for galaxies with $-21 &lt; m_b -5 \log h &lt; -18$, with$&lt;z&gt;=0.116$. the integrated merger rate to $z=1$ for both samples is about 20%, but this depends sensitively on the fraction of kinematic pairs that aretruly undergoing a merger (assumed here to be 50%), the evolution of the mergerrate (here as $(1+z)^3$) and the adopted timescale for mergers (0.2 and 0.5 gyrfor each sample, respectively). galaxies involved in mergers tend to bemarginally bluer than non-interacting galaxies and show an excess of bothearly-type and very late-type objects and a deficiency of intermediate-typespirals. this suggests that interactions and mergers partly drive the starformation and morphological evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;0508365	the millennium galaxy catalogue: on the natural sub-division of galaxies	the distribution of global photometric, spectroscopic, structural andmorphological parameters for a well defined sample of 350 nearby galaxies hasbeen examined. the usual trends were recovered demonstrating that e/s0 galaxiesare redder, more quiescent, more centrally concentrated and possess largersersic indices than later type galaxies.  multivariate statistical analyses were performed to examine the distributionof all parameters simultaneously. the main result of these analyses was theexistence of only two classes of galaxies, corresponding closely to early andlate types. linear discriminant analysis was able to reproduce theclassifications of early and late types galaxies with high success, but furtherrefinement of galaxy types was not reproduced in the distribution of observedgalaxy properties. a principal components analysis showed that the majorvariance of the parameter set corresponded to a distinction between early andlate types, highlighting the importance of the distinction. a hierarchicalclustering analysis revealed only two clear natural classes within theparameter set, closely corresponding to early and late types. early and latetypes are clearly distinct and the distinction is of fundamental importance. incontrast, late types from sa to irr are smoothly distributed throughout theparameter space.  a population of galaxies classified by eye as elliptical/lenticular, andexhibiting concentration indices similar to early-types were found to have asignificant star-formation activity. these galaxies are preferentially faint,suggesting they are low-mass systems.

astro-ph;0604211	the millennium galaxy catalogue: a census of local compact galaxies	we use the millennium galaxy catalogue (mgc) to study the effect of compactgalaxies on the local field galaxy luminosity function. here we observationallydefine as `compact' galaxies that are too small to be reliably distinguishedfrom stars using a standard star-galaxy separation technique. in particular, weestimate the fraction of galaxies that are misclassified as stars due to theircompactness. we have spectroscopically identified all objects to b_mgc = 20 magin a 1.14 deg^2 sub-region of the mgc, regardless of morphology. from thesedata we develop a model of the high surface brightness incompleteness andestimate that ~1 per cent of galaxies with b_mgc &lt; 20 mag are misclassified asstars, with an upper limit of 2.3 per cent at 95 per cent confidence. however,since the missing galaxies are preferentially sub-l* their effect on the faintend of the luminosity function is substantially amplified: we find that theycontribute ~6 per cent to the total luminosity function in the range -17 &lt; m_b&lt; -14 mag, which raises the faint end slope alpha by 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}.their contribution to the total b-band luminosity density is ~2 per cent.roughly half of the missing galaxies have already been recovered throughspectroscopy of morphologically stellar targets selected mainly by colour. wefind that the missing galaxies mostly consist of intrinsically small, blue,star-forming, sub-l* objects. in combination with the recent results of driveret al. (2005) we have now demonstrated that the mgc is free from both high andlow surface brightness selection bias for giant galaxies (m_b &lt;~ -17 mag).dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, are significantly affected by theseselection effects. to gain a complete view of the dwarf population will requireboth deeper and higher resolution surveys.
