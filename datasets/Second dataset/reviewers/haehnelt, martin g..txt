0905.1689	growing the first bright quasars in cosmological simulations of  structure formation	we employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the growth ofmassive black holes (bhs) at high redshifts subject to bh merger recoils fromgravitational wave emission. we select the most massive dark matter halo at z=6from the millennium simulation, and resimulate its formation at much higherresolution including gas physics and a model for bh seeding, growth andfeedback. assuming that the initial bh seeds are relatively massive, of theorder of 10^5 msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloesof mass 10^9-10^10 msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassivebhs (smbhs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extendededdington-limited accretion periods. the properties of the simulated smbhs areconsistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated bh massesand bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within thehost halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions ofthe host galaxy. after a peak in the bh accretion rate at z=6, the most massivebh has become sufficiently massive for the growth to enter into a much slowerphase of feedback-regulated accretion. we explore the full range of expectedrecoils and radiative efficiencies, and also consider models with spinning bhs.in the most `pessimistic' case where bh spins are initially high, we find thatthe growth of the smbhs can be potentially hampered if they grow mostly inisolation and experience only a small number of mergers. whereas bh kicks canexpel a substantial fraction of low mass bhs, they do not significantly affectthe build up of the smbhs. on the contrary, a large number of bh mergers hasbeneficial consequences for the growth of the smbhs by considerably reducingtheir spin.

0912.1345	faint extended lyalpha emission due to star formation at the centre of  high-column density qso absorption systems	we use detailed lyalpha radiative transfer calculations to further test theclaim of rauch et al. (2008) that they have detected spatially extended faintlyalpha emission from the elusive host population of damped lyalpha absorptionsystems (dlas) in their recent ultra-deep spectroscopic survey. we investigatethe spatial and spectral distribution of lyalpha emission due to star-formationat the centre of dlas, and its dependence on the spatial and velocity structureof the gas. our model simultaneously reproduces the observed properties of dlasand the faint lyalpha emitters, including the velocity width and column densitydistribution of dlas and the large spatial extent of the emission of the faintemitters. our modelling confirms previous suggestions that dlas arepredominately hosted by dark matter (dm) halos in the mass range10^{9.5}-10^{12} m_sun, and are thus of significantly lower mass than thoseinferred for l_* lyman break galaxies (lbgs). our modelling suggests that dmhalos hosting dlas retain up to 20% of the cosmic baryon fraction in the formof neutral hydrogen, and that star formation at the centre of the halos isresponsible for the faint lyalpha emission. the scattering of a significantfraction of the lyalpha emission to the observed radii, which can be as largeas 50 kpc or more, requires the amplitude of the bulk motions of the gas at thecentre of the halos to be moderate. the observed space density and sizedistribution of the emitters together with the incidence rate of dlas suggeststhat the lyalpha emission due to star formation has a duty cycle of ~ 25%.

1001.3415	a first direct measurement of the intergalactic medium temperature  around a quasar at z=6	the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (igm) provides an indirectprobe of both the hi and heii reionisation epochs. current constraints on theigm temperature from the lya forest are restricted to the redshift range2&lt;z&lt;4.5, limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of hi reionisationtoward higher redshift. in this work, we present the first direct measurementof the igm temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the doppler widths oflya absorption lines in the proximity zone of sdss j0818+1722. we use a highresolution (r= 40000) keck/hires spectrum in combination with detailednumerical modelling to obtain the temperature at mean density,t_0=23600\pm^5000_6900k (\pm^9200_9300k) at 68 (95) per cent confidenceassuming a prior probability 13500k&lt;t_0&lt;38500 k following hi and heiireionisation. this enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of hireionisation, z_h, within 33 comoving mpc of sdss j0818+1722. if the quasarreionises the heii in its vicinity, then in the limit of instantaneousreionisation we infer z_h&lt;9.0 (11.0) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assumingphotoheating is the dominant heat source and that hi reionisation is driven byionising sources with soft spectra, typical of population ii stars. if the hiand heii in the igm around sdss j0818+1722 are instead reionised simultaneouslyby a population of massive metal-free stars, characterised by very hardionising spectra, we obtain a tighter upper limit of z_h&lt;8.4 (9.4). initiatingreionisation at higher redshifts produces temperatures which are too low withrespect to our constraint unless the hi ionising sources or the quasar itselfhave spectra significantly harder than typically assumed.

1003.2422	the effect of neutrinos on the matter distribution as probed by the  intergalactic medium	we present a suite of full hydrodynamical cosmological simulations thatquantitatively address the impact of neutrinos on the (mildly non-linear)spatial distribution of matter and in particular on the neutral hydrogendistribution in the intergalactic medium (igm), which is responsible for theintervening lyman-alpha absorption in quasar spectra. the free-streaming ofneutrinos results in a (non-linear) scale-dependent suppression of powerspectrum of the total matter distribution at scales probed by lyman-alphaforest data which is larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25% andstrongly redshift dependent. by extracting a set of realistic mock quasarspectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probabilitydistribution function and flux power spectrum. the differences in the matterpower spectra translate into a ~2.5% (5%) difference in the flux power spectrumfor neutrino masses with sigma m_{\nu} = 0.3 ev (0.6 ev). this rather smalleffect is difficult to detect from present lyman-alpha forest data and nearlyperfectly degenerate with the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum ascharacterised by sigma_8. if the results of the numerical simulations arenormalized to have the same sigma_8 in the initial conditions, then neutrinosproduce a smaller suppression in the flux power of about 3% (5%) for sigmam_{\nu} = 0.6$ ev (1.2 ev) when compared to a simulation without neutrinos. wepresent constraints on neutrino masses using the sloan digital sky survey fluxpower spectrum alone and find an upper limit of sigma m_{\nu} &lt; 0.9$ ev (2sigma c.l.), comparable to constraints obtained from the cosmic microwavebackground data or other large scale structure probes.

1008.2622	detection of extended he ii reionization in the temperature evolution of  the intergalactic medium	we present new measurements of the temperature of the intergalactic medium(igm) derived from the lyman-alpha forest over 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.8. the small-scalestructure in the forest of 61 high-resolution qso spectra is quantified using anew statistic, the curvature, and the conversion to temperature calibratedusing a suite of hydrodynamic simulations. at each redshift we focus onobtaining the temperature at an optimal overdensity probed by the lyman-alphaforest, t(delta), where the temperature is nearly a one-to-one function of thecurvature regardless of the slope of the temperature-density relation. themedian 2-sigma statistical uncertainty in these measurements is 8 per cent,though there may be comparable systematic errors due to the unknown amount ofjeans smoothing in the igm. we use our t(delta) results to infer thetemperature at the mean density, t0. even for a maximally steeptemperature-density relation, t0 must increase from ~8000 k at z ~ 4.4 to&gt;~12000 k at z ~ 2.8. this increase is not consistent with the monotonicdecline in t0 expected in the absence of he ii reionization. we thereforeinterpret the observed rise in temperature as evidence of he ii reionizationbeginning at z &gt;~ 4.4. the evolution of t0 is consistent with an end to he iireionization at z ~ 3, as suggested by opacity measurements of the he iilyman-alpha forest, although the redshift at which t0 peaks will dependsomewhat on the evolution of the temperature-density relation. these newtemperature measurements suggest that the heat input due to the reionization ofhe ii dominates the thermal balance of the igm over an extended period withdelta_z &gt;~ 1.

1101.3319	galactic winds and extended lya emission from the host galaxies of high  column density qso absorption systems	we present 3d resonant radiative transfer simulations of the spatial andspectral diffusion of the lya radiation from a central source in the hostgalaxies of high column density absorption systems at z ~ 3. the radiativetransfer simulations are based on a suite of cosmological galaxy formationsimulations that reproduce a wide range of observed properties of damped lyaabsorption systems. the lya emission is predicted to be spatially extended upto several arcsec, and the spectral width of the lya emission is broadened toseveral hundred (in some case more than thousand) km/s. the distribution andthe dynamical state of the gas in the simulated galaxies is complex, the latterwith significant contributions from rotation and both in- and out-flows. theemerging lya radiation extends to gas with column densities of n_hi ~ 10^{18}cm^{-2} and its spectral shape varies strongly with viewing angle. the strongdependence on the central \hi column density and the hi velocity field suggeststhat the lya emission will also vary strongly with time on timescales of a fewdynamical times of the central region. such variations with time should beespecially pronounced at times where the host galaxy undergoes a major mergerand/or starburst. depending on the pre-dominance of in- or out-flow along agiven sightline and the central column density, the spectra show prominent bluepeaks, red peaks or double-peaked profiles. both spatial distribution andspectral shape are very sensitive to details of the galactic windimplementation. stronger galactic winds result in more spatially extended lyaemission and - somewhat counterintuitively - a narrower spectral distribution.

1105.4876	filamentary infall of cold gas and escape of lyman alpha and hydrogen  ionizing radiation from an interacting high-redshift galaxy	we present observations of a peculiar lyman alpha-emitting galaxy at redshift3.344, discovered in a deep, blind spectroscopic survey for faint lyman alphaemitters with the magellan ii telescope in the hubble ultra deep field (hudf).the galaxy exhibits complex lyman alpha emission, including an extended,asymmetric component that is partially suppressed by damped lyman alphaabsorption, and two spatially elongated, narrow emission features. archival hstacs imaging shows evidence for tidal disruption of the stellar component. thisv=27 galaxy appears to give us unprecedented insights into two fundamentalstages in the formation of structure at high redshift: the inflow of gas intoordinary galaxies, and the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalacticmedium. neutral hydrogen, falling in partly in form of a narrow filament,appears to emit fluorescent lyman alpha photons induced by the stellar ionizingflux escaping from the disturbed galaxy. the in-falling material may representprimary cold accretion or an interaction-triggered inflow. the rate of ionizingphotons required by the observed lyman alpha emission is consistent with therate of photons produced by the observed stellar population, with roughly 50percent of ionizing photons escaping from the immediate galaxy and encounteringthe in-falling gas. the observational properties of the galaxy lend support toa picture where galaxy interactions facilitate the escape of both lyman alphaand ionizing radiation. we argue that galaxies like the present object may becommon at high redshift. this galaxy may therefore be a late example of aninteracting population of dwarf galaxies contributing significantly to thereionization of the universe.

1106.6089	how neutral is the intergalactic medium surrounding the redshift z=7.085  quasar ulas j1120+0641?	the quasar ulas j1120+0641 at redshift z=7.085 has a highly ionised near zonewhich is smaller than those around quasars of similar luminosity at z~6. thespectrum also exhibits evidence for a damping wing extending redward of thesystemic lya redshift. we use radiative transfer simulations in a cosmologicalcontext to investigate the implications for the ionisation state of theinhomogeneous igm surrounding this quasar. our simulations show that thetransmission profile is consistent with an igm in the vicinity of the quasarwith a volume averaged hi fraction of f_hi&gt;0.1 and that ulas j1120+0641 hasbeen bright for 10^6--10^7 yr. the observed spectrum is also consistent withsmaller igm neutral fractions, f_hi ~ 10^-3--10-4, if a damped lya system in anotherwise highly ionised igm lies within 5 proper mpc of the quasar. this is,however, predicted to occur in only ~5 per cent of our simulated sight-linesfor a bright phase of 10^6--10^7 yr. unless ulas j1120+0641 grows during aprevious optically obscured phase, the low age inferred for the quasar adds tothe theoretical challenge of forming a 2x10^9 m_sol black hole at this highredshift.

1109.4416	massive neutrinos and the non-linear matter power spectrum	we perform an extensive suite of n-body simulations of the matter powerspectrum, incorporating massive neutrinos in the range m = 0.15-0.6 ev, probingthe non-linear regime at scales k &lt; 10 hmpc-1 at z &lt; 3. we extend the widelyused halofit approximation to account for the effect of massive neutrinos onthe power spectrum. in the strongly non-linear regime halofit systematicallyover-predicts the suppression due to the free-streaming of the neutrinos. themaximal discrepancy occurs at k ~ 1 hmpc-1, and is at the level of 10% of thetotal suppression. most published constraints on neutrino masses based onhalofit are not affected, as they rely on data probing the matter powerspectrum in the linear or mildly non-linear regime. however, predictions forfuture galaxy, lyman-alpha forest and weak lensing surveys extending to morenon-linear scales will benefit from the improved approximation to thenon-linear matter power spectrum we provide. our approximation reproduces theinduced neutrino suppression over the targeted scales and redshiftssignificantly better. we test its robustness with regard to changingcosmological parameters and a variety of modelling effects.

1110.0539	improved measurements of the intergalactic medium temperature around  quasars: possible evidence for the initial stages of he-ii reionisation at  z~6	we present measurements of the intergalactic medium (igm) temperature within~5 proper mpc of seven luminous quasars at z~6. the constraints are obtainedfrom the doppler widths of lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasarnear-zones and build upon our previous measurement for the z=6.02 quasar sdssj0818+1722. the expanded data set, combined with an improved treatment ofsystematic uncertainties, yields an average temperature at the mean density oflog (t_0/k) = 4.21 \pm 0.03 (\pm^0.06_0.07) at 68 (95) per cent confidence fora flat prior distribution over 3.2 &lt; log (t_0/k) &lt; 4.8. in comparison,temperatures measured from the general igm at z~5 are ~0.3 dex cooler, implyingan additional source of heating around these quasars which is not yet presentin the general igm at slightly lower redshift. this heating is most likely dueto the recent reionisation of he-ii in vicinity of these quasars, which havehard, non-thermal ionising spectra. the elevated temperatures may thereforerepresent evidence for the earliest stages of he-ii reionisation in the mostbiased regions of the high-redshift universe. the temperature as a function ofdistance from the quasars is consistent with being constant, log(t_0/k)~4.2,with no evidence for a line-of-sight thermal proximity effect. however, thelimited extent of the quasar near-zones prevents the detection of he-iiiregions larger than ~5 proper mpc. under the assumption the quasars havereionised the he-ii in their vicinity, we infer the data are consistent with anaverage optically bright phase of duration in excess of 10^6.5 yr. thesemeasurements represent the highest-redshift igm temperature constraints todate, and thus provide a valuable data set for confronting models of h-ireionisation.

1204.5753	detection of dark galaxies and circum-galactic filaments fluorescently  illuminated by a quasar at z=2.4	a deep narrow-band survey for ly-alpha emission carried out on the vlt-fors2has revealed 98 ly-alpha candidates down to a flux limit of 4.e-18 erg/s/cm^2in a volume of 5500 comoving mpc^3 at z=2.4 centered on the hyperluminousquasar he0109-3518. the properties of the detected sources in terms of their i)equivalent width distribution, ii) luminosity function, and iii) the averageluminosity versus projected distance from the quasar, all suggest that a largefraction of these objects have been fluorescently "illuminated" by he0109-3518.this conclusion is supported by comparison with detailed radiative transfersimulations of the effects of the quasar illumination. 18 objects have arest-frame equivalent width (ew0) larger than 240a, the expected limit forly-alpha emission powered by population ii star formation and 12 sources amongthese do not have any continuum counterpart in a deep v-band imaging of thesame field. for these, a stacking analysis indicates ew0&gt;800a, effectivelyruling out ly-alpha powered by internal star formation. these sources are thusthe best candidates so far for proto-galactic clouds or "dark" galaxies athigh-redshift, whose existence has recently been suggested by severaltheoretical studies. assuming they are mostly ionized by the quasar radiation,we estimate that their gas masses would be about 10^9 msun implying that theirstar formation efficiencies (sfe) are less than 1.e-11 yr^-1 several timesbelow the sfe of the most gas-rich dwarf galaxies locally, and five hundredtimes lower than typical massive star-forming galaxies at z~2. we have alsodiscovered extended, filamentary gas, also likely illuminated by the quasar,around some of the brightest continuum-detected sources with ew0&gt;240a. thisemission is compatible with the expectations for circum-galactic cold streamsbut other origins, including tidal stripping, are also possible.

1206.2680	extended and filamentary lyman alpha emission from the formation of a  protogalactic halo at z=2.63	we report the observation of a further asymmetric, extended lyman alphaemitting halo at z=2.63, from our ultra-deep, long-slit spectroscopic survey offaint high redshift emitters, undertaken with magellan ldss3 in the goods-sfield. the lya emission, detected over more than 30 kpc, is spatiallycoincident with a concentration of galaxies visible in deep broad-band imaging.while these faint galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts cannot withcertainty be associated with one another or with the lya emission, there are anumber of compelling reasons why they very probably form a milky way halo-massgroup at the lya redshift. a filamentary structure, possibly consisting of lyaemission at very high equivalent width, and evidence for disturbed stellarpopulations, suggest that the properties of the emitting region reflect ongoinggalaxy assembly, with recent galaxy mergers and star formation occurring in thegroup. hence, the lya provides unique insights into what is probably a key modeof galaxy formation at high redshifts. the lya emission may be powered bycooling radiation or spatially extended star formation in the halo, but isunlikely to be fluorescence driven by either an agn or one of the galaxies. thespatial profile of the emission is conspicuously different from that of typicallya emitters or lyman break galaxies, which is consistent with the picture thatextended emission of this kind represents a different stage in the galaxyformation process. faint, extended lya emitters such as these may be lower-massanalogues of the brighter lya blobs. our observations provide further,circumstantial evidence that galaxy mergers may promote the production and / orescape of ionizing radiation, and that the halos of interacting galaxies may besignificant sources for ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.

1307.5854	the environment of bright qsos at z ~ 6: star forming galaxies and x-ray  emission	we employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate models inwhich the supermassive black holes (bhs) powering luminous z ~ 6 qsos grow frommassive seeds. we simulate at high resolution 18 fields sampling regions withdensities ranging from the mean cosmic density all the way to the highest sigmapeaks in the millennium simulation volume. only in the most massive halos, bhscan grow to masses up to ~ 10^9 msun by z ~ 6 without invoking super-eddingtonaccretion. accretion onto the most massive bhs becomes limited by thermal agnfeedback by z ~ 9-8 with further bh growth proceeding in short eddingtonlimited bursts. our modelling suggests that current flux-limited surveys ofqsos at high redshift preferentially detect objects at their peak luminosityand therefore miss a substantial population of qsos powered by similarlymassive bhs but with low accretion rates. to test whether the required hosthalo masses are consistent with the observed galaxy environment of z ~ 6 qsos,we produce realistic rest-frame uv images of our simulated galaxies. withoutstrong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of bright galaxieslarger than observed by a factor ten or more. supernova-driven galactic windsreduce the predicted numbers to a level consistent with observations indicatingthat stellar feedback was already very efficient at high redshifts. we havefurther investigated the effect of thermal agn feedback on the surrounding gas.our adopted agn feedback prescription drives mostly energy-driven highlyanisotropic outflows with gas speeds of &gt;= 1000 km/s to distances of &gt;= 10 kpcconsistent with observations. the spatially extended thermal x-ray emissionaround bright qsos powered by these outflows can exceed by large factors theemission expected without agn feedback and is an important diagnostic of themechanism whereby agn feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.

(2011). we infer weak oi absorbers (ew &gt; 0.1 a) to have typical hi columndensities in the range of sub-dlas, densities of 80 times the mean baryonicdensity and metallicities of about 1/500 th solar. this is similar to themetallicity inferred at similar overdensities at z~3, suggesting that the metalenrichment of the circumgalactic medium around low-mass galaxies has alreadyprogressed considerably by z~6. the apparently rapid evolution of the incidencerates for oi absorption over the redshift range 5&lt;z&lt;6 mirrors that ofself-shielded lyman-limit systems at lower redshift and is mainly due to therapid decrease of the meta-galactic photo-ionization rate at z&gt;5. we predictthe incidence rate of oi absorbers to continue to rise rapidly with increasingredshift as the igm becomes more neutral. if the distribution of metals extendsto lower density regions, oi absorbers will allow the metal enrichment of theincreasingly neutral filamentary structures of the cosmic web to be probed.

1312.4962	numerical resolution effects on simulations of massive black hole seeds	we have performed high-resolution numerical simulations with thehydrodynamical amr code enzo to investigate the formation of massive seed blackholes in a sample of six dark matter haloes above the atomic cooling threshold.the aim of this study is to illustrate the effects of varying the maximumrefinement level on the final object formed. the virial temperatures of thesimulated haloes range from $\rm{t} \sim 10000\ \rm{k} - 16000\ \rm{k}$ andthey have virial masses in the range $\rm{m} \sim 2 \times 10^7 \rm{m_{\odot}}$to $\rm{m} \sim 7 \times 10^7 \rm{m_{\odot}}$ at $z \sim 15$. the outcome ofour six fiducial simulations is both generic and robust. a rotationallysupported, marginally gravitationally stable, disk forms with an exponentialprofile. the mass and scale length of this disk depends strongly on the maximumrefinement level used. varying the maximum refinement level by factors between1 / 64 to 256 times the fiducial level illustrates the care that must be takenin interpreting the results. the lower resolution simulations show tentativeevidence that the gas may become rotationally supported out to 20 pc while thehighest resolution simulations show only weak evidence of rotational supportdue to the shorter dynamical times for which the simulation runs. the higherresolution simulations do, however, point to fragmentation at small scales ofthe order of $\sim 100$ au. in the highest resolution simulations a centralobject of a few times $10^2\ \rm{m_{\odot}}$ forms with multiple stronglybound, jeans unstable, clumps of $\sim 10\ \rm{m_{\odot}}$ and radii of 10 - 20au suggesting the formation of dense star clusters in these haloes.

1406.2691	feedback from active galactic nuclei: energy- versus momentum-driving	we employ hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code arepo toinvestigate the role of energy and momentum input from active galactic nuclei(agn) in driving large-scale galactic outflows. we start by reproducinganalytic solutions for both energy- and momentum-driven outflowing shells insimulations of a spherical isolated dark matter potential with gas inhydrostatic equilibrium and with no radiative cooling. we confirm that for thissimplified setup, galactic outflows driven by a momentum input rate of orderl_edd/c can establish an m_bh - sigma relation with slope and normalisationsimilar to that observed. we show that momentum input at a rate of l_edd/c ishowever insufficient to drive efficient outflows once cooling and gas inflowsas predicted by cosmological simulations at resolved scales are taken intoaccount. we argue that observed large-scale agn-driven outflows are insteadlikely to be energy-driven and show that such outflows can reach momentumfluxes exceeding 10 l_edd/c within the innermost 10 kpc of the galaxy. theoutflows are highly anisotropic, with outflow rates and a velocity structurefound to be inadequately described by spherical outflow models. we verify thatthe hot energy-driven outflowing gas is expected to be strongly affected bymetal-line cooling, leading to significant amounts (&gt;10^9 m_sun) of entrainedcold gas.

1411.0678	fast cold gas in hot agn outflows	observations of the emission from spatially extended cold gas around brighthigh-redshift qsos reveal surprisingly large velocity widths exceeding 2000 kms^(-1), out to projected distances as large as 30 kpc. the high velocity widthshave been interpreted as the signature of powerful agn-driven outflows.naively, these findings appear in tension with hydrodynamic models in whichagn-driven outflows are energy-driven and thus very hot with typicaltemperatures t = 10^6-7 k. using the moving-mesh code arepo, we perform'zoom-in' cosmological simulations of a z = 6 qso and its environment,following black hole growth and feedback via energy-driven outflows. in thesimulations, the qso host galaxy is surrounded by a clumpy circum-galacticmedium pre-enriched with metals due to supernovae-driven galactic outflows. asa result, part of the agn-driven hot outflowing gas can cool radiatively,leading to large amounts (&gt; 10^9 m_sun) of cold gas comoving with the hotbipolar outflow. this results in velocity widths of spatially extended cold gassimilar to those observed. we caution, however, that gas inflows, randommotions in the deep potential well of the qso host galaxy and cooling ofsupernovae-driven winds contribute significantly to the large velocity width ofthe cold gas in the simulations, complicating the interpretation ofobservational data.

1505.01853	calibrating cosmological radiative transfer simulations with lyman alpha  forest data: evidence for large spatial uv background fluctuations at z ~ 5.6  - 5.8 due to rare bright sources	we calibrate here cosmological radiative transfer simulation with aton/ramseswith a range of measurements of the lyman alpha opacity from qso absorptionspectra. we find the lyman alpha opacity to be very sensitive to the exacttiming of hydrogen reionisation. models reproducing the measured evolution ofthe mean photoionisation rate and average mean free path reach overlap at z ~ 7and predict an accelerated evolution of the lyman alpha opacity at z &gt; 6consistent with the rapidly evolving luminosity function of lyman alphaemitters in this redshift range. similar to "optically thin" simulations ourfull radiative transfer simulations fail, however, to reproduce thehigh-opacity tail of the lyman alpha opacity pdf at z &gt; 5. we argue that thisis due to spatial uv fluctuations in the post-overlap phase of reionisation onsubstantially larger scales than predicted by our source model, where theionising emissivity is dominated by large numbers of sub-l* galaxies. wefurther argue that this suggests a significant contribution to the ionising uvbackground by much rarer bright sources at high redshift.

astro-ph;0007369	the correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion in  hierarchical galaxy formation models	recent work has demonstrated that there is a tight correlation between themass of a black hole and the velocity dispersion of the bulge of its hostgalaxy. we show that the model of kauffmann &amp; haehnelt, in which bulges andsupermassive black holes both form during major mergers, produces a correlationbetween m_bh and sigma with slope and scatter comparable to the observedrelation. in the model, the m_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter thanthe correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlationbetween bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. there are two reasons forthis: i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersionbut not on the formation epoch of the bulge, whereas the stellar masses of theprogenitors depend on both; ii) mergers between galaxies move black holes alongthe observed m_bh - sigma relation, even at late times when the galaxies aregas-poor and black holes grow mainly by merging of pre-existing black holes. weconclude that the small scatter in the observed m_bh - sigma relation isconsistent with a picture in which bulges and black holes form over a widerange in redshift.

astro-ph;0010631	an ionizing uv background dominated by massive stars	we discuss implications of a stellar-dominated uv background at highredshifts. the composite spectrum of 29 lbgs evaluated by steidel etal (2000)at &lt;z&gt;=3.4 can be well fit by a stellar population with ongoing star formation,a salpeter initial mass function, modest or negligible dust reddening, and nointrinsic hi photoelectric absorption. fading starbursts in which starformation has ceased for 10^7 yr or more cannot reproduce the observed fluxshortward of 1 ryd.the escape fraction of h-ionizing photons must be close to100 percent for the observed sample of lbgs. the spectrum of ionizing photonsproduced by a stellar population with ongoing star formation is similar to thatof qsos between 1 and 3 ryd, becomes softer between 3 and 4 ryd and dropssharply shortward of 4 ryd. a galaxy-dominated uv background appearsinconsistent with the observed heii/hi opacity ratio at z=2.4, but might beable to explain the siiv/civ abundances measured at z&gt;3 in absorption spectra.a scenario may be emerging where star-forming galaxies reionized intergalactichydrogen at $z&gt;6$ and dominate the 1 ryd metagalactic flux at z&gt;3, withquasi-stellar sources taking over at low redshifts. if the large amplitude ofthe h-ionizing flux estimated by steidel etal is correct, hydrodynamicalsimulations of structure formation in the igm require a baryon density (toexplain the observed lyalpha opacity in absorption spectra) which is similar toor larger than that favoured by recent cmb experiments, and is inconsistentwith standard nucleosynthesis values.

astro-ph;0112096	feeding black holes at galactic centres by capture from isothermal cusps	we estimate the rate at which stars are captured by supermassive black holes(bhs) in the centres of bulges and elliptical galaxies assuming that theseinitially had an isothermal cusp (rho ~ r^{-2} with velocity dispersionsigma_*). if radial orbits can be adequately replenished a bh can growsignificantly by capturing stars and particles of the dark halo; the lattercould be up to 20--40 percent of the total mass captured. a tight relation m_bh10^8 (sigma_*/200\kms)^5 between bh hole mass and stellar velocity dispersionarises at the high mass end m_bh &gt;= 10^8 m_sun if these giant bhs growprimarily by swallowing stars. for smaller masses a gradual flattening of therelation and an increase of the scatter are expected due to tidal disruption ofstars. at moderate redshifts when bright galaxies may still possess isothermalcusps tidal disruption flares may be as frequent as 10^{-4} -- 10^{-2} yr^{-1}per galaxy, a few percent of the supernovae rate. efficient randomization ofthe orbits can occur when the dense cores of infalling satellites sink to thesphere of influence of the bh by dynamical friction. efficient replenishment ofthe loss cone of radial orbits can also explain why the supermassive binary bhsexpected in hierarchically merging galaxies do generally coalesce, as suggestedby the observed relation between bh mass and the inferred mass of stars ejectedfrom an isothermal cusp.

astro-ph;0208215	multiple black holes in galactic bulges	we study the number and interaction rates of supermassive black holes ingalactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation inwhich the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. in brightellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binaryblack hole is large. central binaries must therefore merge in less than ahubble time -- otherwise there will be too much scatter in the m-sigma relationand too many off-center galactic nuclei. we propose that binary black holes areable to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger qso activityin galaxies. if this is the case, less than 10 percent of faint ellipticals and40 percent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holeswith near equal masses at their centres. this binary may be ejected away fromthe centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 percentof the most luminous ellipticals. the number of low mass black holes that caninteract with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxyluminosity. in most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre ofthe galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminousellipticals, an average of 10 low mass black holes interact with the centralsupermassive object after this time. it is expected that stars will be ejectedfrom galaxy cores as these low mass-ratio binaries harden. multiple black holesin galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematictrends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function ofluminosity.

astro-ph;0307379	hierarchical build-up of galactic bulges and the merging rate of  supermassive binary black holes	the hierarchical build-up of galactic bulges should lead to the build-up ofpresent-day supermassive black holes by a mixture of gas accretion and mergingof supermassive black holes. the tight relation between black hole mass andstellar velocity dispersion is thereby a strong argument that the supermassiveblack holes in merging galactic bulges do indeed merge. otherwise the ejectionof supermassive black holes by gravitational slingshot would lead to excessivescatter in this relation. at high redshift the coalescence of massive blackhole binaries is likely to be driven by the accretion of gas in the majormergers signposted by optically bright qso activity. if massive black holesonly form efficiently by direct collapse of gas in deep galactic potentialwells with v_c &gt; 100 km/s as postulated in the model of kauffmann &amp; haehnelt(2000) lisa expects to see event rates from the merging of massive binary blackholes of about 0.1-1 yr^{-1} spread over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5. if,however, the hierarchical build-up of supermassive black holes extends topre-galactic structures with significantly shallower potential wells eventrates may be as high as 10-100 yr^{-1} and will be dominated by events fromredshift z &gt; 5.

astro-ph;0311209	galactic winds and the lya forest	we study the effect of galactic outflows on the lya forest. the winds aremodelled as fully ionised spherical bubbles centered around galactic haloes.the observed flux probability distribution and flux power spectrum limit thevolume filling factor of bubbles to be less than 10%. we have compared the meanflux as a function of distance from haloes with the adelberger etal (assp)measurement. a model with bubbles of constant radius of 1.5mpc/h surroundingthe most massive haloes matches the high transmissivity at separations&lt;0.5mpc/h, but the increase of the transmissivity at small scales is moregradual than observed. at separations &lt;0.5mpc/h, our estimate of the cosmicvariance error is $\delta f\sim 0.3$, 30% higher than that of assp. thedifficulty in matching the rise in the transmissivity at small separations iscaused by residual absorption of neutral hydrogen lying physically outside thebubbles but having a redshift position similar to the haloes. the flux level isthus sensitive to the amplitude of the coherent velocity shear near haloeswhich increases with halo mass in the simulation. a model where lbgs arestarbursts in small mass haloes matches the observations with smaller bubblesize than one where more massive haloes host the lbgs. a starburst model with abubble radius of 1mpc/h and a volume filling factor of 2% is consistent withthe assp measurements at the 1-1.5$\sigma$ level. if this model is correct thesharp rise of the transmissivity at small separation in the assp sample is dueto cosmic variance and is expected to become more moderate for a larger sample.

(1993) which croft et al. used. for the smaller optical depth weobtain a ~ 20% higher value for the rms fluctuation amplitude of the matterdensity. by combining the amplitude of the matter power spectrum inferred fromthe lyman-alpha forest with the amplitude on large scales inferred frommeasurements of the cmb we obtain constraints on the primordial spectral indexn and the normalisation sigma_8. for values of the mean optical depth favouredby high-resolution spectra, the inferred linear power spectrum is consistentwith a lambdacdm model with a scale-free (n=1) primordial power spectrum.

astro-ph;0508177	cosmological and astrophysical parameters from the sdss flux power  spectrum and hydrodynamical simulations of the lyman-alpha forest	(abridged) the flux power spectrum of the lyman-alpha forest in quasar (qso)absorption spectra is sensitive to a wide range of cosmological andastrophysical parameters and instrumental effects. modelling the flux powerspectrum in this large parameter space to an accuracy comparable to thestatistical uncertainty of large samples of qso spectra is very challenging. weuse here a coarse grid of hydrodynamical simulations run with gadget-2 toobtain a ``best guess'' model around which we calculate a finer grid of fluxpower spectra using a taylor expansion of the flux power spectrum to firstorder. we find that the sdss flux power spectrum alone is able to constrain awide range of parameters including the amplitude of the matter power spectrumsigma_8, the matter density omega_m, the spectral index of primordial densityfluctuations n, the effective optical depth tau_eff and its evolution. thethermal history of the intergalactic medium (igm) is, however, poorlyconstrained and the sdss data favour either an unplausibly large temperature oran unplausibly steep temperature-density relation. by enforcing a thermalhistory of the igm consistent with that inferred from high-resolution qsospectra, we find the following values for the best fitting model (assuming aflat universe with a cosmological constant and zero neutrino mass): omega_m=0.28 \pm 0.03, n=0.95\pm0.04, \sigma_8=0.91\pm0.07 (1\sigma error bars).weargue that the major uncertainties in this measurement are still systematicrather than statistical.

astro-ph;0604310	the lyman-alpha forest and wmap year three	a combined analysis of cosmic microwave background (cmb) and lyman-a forestdata allows to constrain the matter power spectrum from small scales of about 1mpc/h all the way to the horizon scale. the long lever arm and complementarityprovided by such an analysis has previously led to a significant tightening ofthe constraints on the shape and the amplitude of the power spectrum ofprimordial density fluctuations. we present here a combined analysis of thewmap three year results with lyman-a forest data. the amplitude of the matterpower spectrum sigma_8 and the spectral index ns inferred from the jointanalysis with high resolution lyman-a forest data and low resolution lyman-aforest data as analyzed by viel &amp; haehnelt (2006) are consistent with the newwmap results to within 1 sigma. the joint analysis with the mainly lowresolution data as analysed by mcdonald et al. (2005) suggests a value ofsigma_8 which is ~ 2 sigma higher than that inferred from the wmap three yeardata alone. the joint analysis of the three year wmap and the lyman-a forestdata also does not favour a running of the spectral index. the best fit valuesfor a combined analysis of the three year wmap data, other cmb data, 2df andthe lyman-a forest data are (sigma_8, ns) = (0.78\pm 0.03,0.96 \pm 0.01).

astro-ph;0606638	numerical simulations of the lyman-alpha forest - a comparison of  gadget-2 and enzo	we compare simulations of the lyman-alpha forest performed with two differenthydrodynamical codes, gadget-2 and enzo. a comparison of the dark matter powerspectrum for simulations run with identical initial conditions show differencesof 1-3% at the scales relevant for quantitative studies of the lyman-alphaforest. this allows a meaningful comparison of the effect of the differentimplementations of the hydrodynamic part of the two codes. using the samecooling and heating algorithm in both codes the differences in the temperatureand the density probability distribution function are of the order of 10%.these differences can be mainly attributed to a slight mismatch in theresolution. the differences are smaller than or equal to the effects of boxsizeand resolution on these statistics. once resolution effects are taken intoaccount the differences in the flux power spectrum - the statistics most widelyused for estimating the matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters fromlyman-alpha forest data - are about 5%. this is again smaller than or equal tothe effects of boxsize and resolution. numerical uncertainties due to aparticular implementation of solving the hydrodynamic or gravitationalequations appear therefore to contribute only moderately to the error budget inestimates of the flux power spectrum from numerical simulations. we furtherfind that the differences in the flux power spectrum for enzo simulations runwith and without adaptive mesh refinement are also of order 5% or smaller. thelatter require 10 times less cpu time making the cpu time requirement similarto that of a version of gadget-2 that is optimised for lyman-alpha forestsimulations.

astro-ph;0607331	the nature and evolution of the highly ionized near-zones in the  absorption spectra of z~6 quasars	we use state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations combined with a 1dradiative transfer code to assess the extent to which the highly ionizedregions observed close to z~6 quasars, which we refer to as near-zones, canconstrain the ionization state of the surrounding igm. we find the appearancein lya absorption of a quasar hii ionization front expanding into a neutral igmcan be very similar to a classical proximity zone, produced by the enhancementin ionizing flux close to a quasar embedded in a highly ionized igm. theobserved sizes of these highly ionized near-zones and their redshift evolutioncan be reproduced for a wide range of igm neutral hydrogen fractions forplausible values of the luminosity and lifetime of the quasars. the observednear-zone sizes at the highest observed redshifts are equally consistent with asignificantly neutral and a highly ionized surrounding igm. strongerconstraints on the igm neutral hydrogen fraction can be obtained by consideringthe relative size of the near-zones in the lya and lyb regions of a quasarspectrum. a large sample of high quality quasar absorption spectra withaccurate determinations of near-zone sizes and their redshift evolution in boththe lya and lyb regions should confirm or exclude the possibility that theuniverse is predominantly neutral at the highest observed redshifts. the widthof the discrete absorption features in these near-zones will contain importantadditional information on the ionization state and the previous thermal historyof the igm at these redshifts.

astro-ph;0609081	probing the growth of supermassive black holes at z&gt;6 with lofar	hii regions surrounding supermassive black holes (bhs) in an otherwise stillneutral intergalactic medium (igm) are likely to be the most easily detectablesources by future 21cm experiments like lofar. we have made predictions for thesize distribution of such hii regions for several physically motivated modelsfor bh growth at high redshift and compared this to the expected lofarsensitivity to these sources. the number of potentially detectable hii regionsdoes not only depend on the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium andthe decoupling of the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen from the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature, but is also strongly sensitive to therate of growth of bhs at high redshift. if the supermassive bhs at redshift 6were built up via continuous eddington-limited accretion from low mass seed bhsat high redshift, then lofar is not expected to detect isolated qso hii regionsat redshifts much larger than 6, and only if the igm is still significantlyneutral. if the high-redshift growth of bhs starts with massive seed bhs and isdriven by short-lived accretion events following the merging of bh hostinggalaxies then the detection of hii regions surrounding supermassive bhs mayextend to redshifts as large as 8-9 but is still very sensitive to the redshiftto which the igm remains significantly neutral. the most optimistic predictionsare for a model where the supermassive bhs at z&gt;6 have grown slowly. hiiregions around supermassive bhs may then be detected to significantly largerredshifts.

astro-ph;0703306	the observed ionization rate of the intergalactic medium and the  ionizing emissivity at z &gt;5: evidence for a photon starved and extended epoch  of reionization	we use a large set of hydrodynamical simulations, combined with measurementsof the lyman alpha opacity of the igm taken from the literature, to obtainrobust estimates for the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom at z=5 and 6.we find the photoionization rate drops by a factor of two and four,respectively, compared to our recent measurements at z = 2 - 4. the number ofionizing photons emitted by known sources at z=5 and 6, based on anextrapolation of source numbers below the detection limit and standardassumptions for the relationship between the ionizing emissivity and observedluminosity density at 1500 angstroms, are in reasonable agreement with thephotoionization rates inferred from the lyman alpha forest if the escapefraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is large (&gt;= 20 per cent). claims tothe contrary may be attributed to the adoption of an unduly high value for theclumping factor of ionized hydrogen. using physically motivated assumptions forthe mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionizationrate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. in comovingunits the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshiftrange 2-6 and corresponds to 1.5-3 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over atime interval corresponding to the age of the universe at z=6. this stronglysuggests that the epoch of reionization was photon-starved and extended.[abridged]

astro-ph;9410079	momentum transfer by an internal source of ionizing radiation - an  important feedback process during galaxy formation ?!	the role of momentum transfer (``radiation pressure'') due to an internalsource of ionizing radiation for the formation of baryonic structures isinvestigated. fully-ionized self-gravitating gaseous objects can beradiation-pressure supported on a characteristic length scale $d_{\rm rp} \sim100 \pc - 3 \kpc$. on smaller scales momentum transfer due to ionizingradiation will be the dominant force and for spherical collapsing objects ofmass $\la 10^{10}\msol$ a complete bounce is possible. a population of massivestars and/or accretion onto a central compact object are natural sources ofionizing radiation in newly-forming baryonic structures. radiation pressure istherefore likely to play an important role for the dynamical and thermalevolution of the intergalactic medium and the mass-to-light ratio of smallgalaxies. the effect will be especially important for hierarchical cosmogonieswhere galactic structures build up by merging of smaller objects. radiationpressure due to ionizing radiation might furthermore be responsible forsubstructures of size $d_{\rm rp}$ in the stellar component of large galaxies.

astro-ph;9507077	using the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich effect to determine the peculiar  velocities of clusters of galaxies	we have investigated the possibility of inferring peculiar velocities forclusters of galaxies from the doppler shift of scattered cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) photons. we find that if the core radius of the gasdistribution or the beam size of the instrument is larger than 3-7 arcminutes,then the maximum attainable signal-to-noise ratio is determined by confusionwith primary fluctuations. for smaller angular scales, ``cosmic confusion'' isless important and instrumental noise and/or foreground emission will be thelimiting factor. for a cluster with the optical depth of the coma cluster andfor an optimal filtering technique, typical one-sigma errors span the widerange from 400 to 1600 km/s, depending on the cosmological model, theresolution of the instrument and the core radius of the cluster. the resultshave important implications for the design of future high-resolution surveys ofthe cmb. individual peculiar velocities will be measurable only for a few fastmoving clusters at intermediate redshift unless cosmic fluctuations are smallerthan most standard cosmological scenarios predict. however, a reliablemeasurement of bulk velocities of ensembles of x-ray bright clusters will bepossible on very large scales (100-500 mpc/h).

astro-ph;9706201	damped lyman alpha absorbers at high redshift -- large disks or galactic  building blocks?	we investigate the nature of the physical structures giving rise to dampedlyman alpha absorption systems (dlas) at high redshift. in particular, weexamine the suggestion that rapidly rotating large disks are the only viableexplanation for the characteristic observed asymmetric profiles of lowionization absorption lines. we demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations ofgalaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumpscan reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of theabsorption profiles equally well. the velocity broadening in the simulatedclumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging. theobserved velocity width correlates with the virial velocity of the dark matterhalo of the forming protogalactic clump (v_{wid} ~ 0.6 times v_{vir} for themedian values with a large scatter of order a factor two between differentlines-of-sight). the typical virial velocity of the halos required to give riseto the dlas population is about 100 km/s and most standard hierarchicalstructure formation scenarios can easily account even for the largest observedvelocity widths. we conclude that the evidence that dlas at high redshift arerelated to large rapidly rotating disks with v_circ &gt;= 200 km/s is notcompelling.

astro-ph;9712259	high-redshift galaxies, their active nuclei and central black holes	we demonstrate that the luminosity function of the recently detectedpopulation of star-forming galaxies and the qso luminosity function at z=3 canbe matched with the mass function of dark matter haloes predicted byhierarchical cosmogonies for lifetimes of optically bright qsos in the range10^6 to 10^8 yr. we suggest that the mass of supermassive black holes may belimited by the back-reaction of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in aself-gravitating disc. this would imply a relation of black hole to halo massof the form m_bh ~(v_halo)^5 and a typical duration of the optically bright qsophase of a few times 10^7 yr. the high integrated mass density of black holesinferred from recent black hole mass estimates in nearby galaxies may indicatethat the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing bluelight is smaller than previously assumed. we discuss three possible accretionmodes with low optical emission efficiency: (i) accretion at far above theeddington rate, (ii) accretion obscured by dust, and (iii) accretion below thecritical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for ahubble time. we further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency mightbe closely related to the origin of the hard x-ray background and that theionizing background might be progressively dominated by stars rather than qsosat higher redshift.

0809.5056	a joint model for the emission and absorption properties of damped lyman  alpha absorption systems	the recently discovered population of ultra-faint extended line emitters canaccount for the majority of the incidence rate of damped lyman alpha systems(dlas) at z ~ 3 if the line emission is interpreted as ly alpha. we show herethat a model similar to that proposed by haehnelt, steinmetz, &amp; rauch (2000),which explains the incidence rate and kinematics of dlas in the context of$\lambda$cdm models for structure formation, also reproduces the sizedistribution of the new population of faint ly alpha emitters for plausibleparameters. this lends further support to identification of the emitters withthe hitherto elusive population of dla host galaxies. the observed incidencerate of dlas together with the observed space density and size distribution ofthe emitters suggest a duty cycle of ~ 0.2 - 0.4 for the ly alpha emission fromdla host galaxies. we further show that ly alpha cooling is expected tocontribute little to the ly alpha emission for the majority of emitters. thisleaves centrally concentrated star formation at a rate of a few tenthsm_sun/yr, surrounded by extended ly alpha halos with radii up to 30-50 kpc, asthe most plausible explanation for the origin of the emission. both theluminosity function of ly alpha emission and the velocity width distribution oflow ionization absorption require that galaxies inside dark matter (dm) haloswith virial velocities &lt; 50 - 70 km/s contribute little to the incidence rateof dlas at z ~ 3, suggesting that energy and momentum input due to starformation efficiently removes gas from these halos. galaxies with dm halos withvirial velocities of 100 - 150 km/s appear to account for the majority of dlahost galaxies. dla host galaxies at z ~ 3 should thus become the buildingblocks of typical present-day galaxies.

0810.0024	the formation of compact massive self-gravitating discs in metal-free  haloes with virial temperatures of ~ 13000-30000 k	we have used the hydrodynamical amr code enzo to investigate the dynamicalevolution of the gas at the centre of dark matter haloes with virial velocitiesof ~ 20 - 30 kms and virial temperatures of ~ 13000-30000 k at z ~ 15 in acosmological context. the virial temperature of the dark matter haloes is abovethe threshold where atomic cooling by hydrogen allows the gas to cool andcollapse. we neglect cooling by molecular hydrogen and metals, as may beplausible if h_2 cooling is suppressed by a meta-galactic lyman-wernerbackground or an internal source of lyman-werner photons, and metal enrichmenthas not progressed very far. the gas in the haloes becomes gravitationallyunstable and develops turbulent velocities comparable to the virial velocitiesof the dark matter haloes. within a few dynamical times it settles into anearly isothermal density profile over many decades in radius losing most ofits angular momentum in the process. about 0.1 - 1 % of the baryons, at thecentre of the dark matter haloes, collapse into a self-gravitating, fat,ellipsoidal, centrifugally supported exponential disc with scale-length of ~0.075-0.27 pc and rotation velocities of 25-60 kms. we are able to follow thesettling of the gas into centrifugal support and the dynamical evolution of thecompact disc in each dark matter halo for a few dynamical times. the dynamicalevolution of the gas at the centre of the haloes is complex. in one of thehaloes the gas at the centre fragments into a triple system leading to strongtidal perturbations and eventually to the in-fall of a secondary smaller clumpinto the most massive primary clump. the formation of centrifugally supportedself-gravitating massive discs is likely to be an important intermediary stageen route to the formation of a massive black hole seed.

0810.2802	pathways to massive black holes and compact star clusters in  pre-galactic dark matter haloes with virial temperatures &gt; 10000k	large dynamic range numerical simulations of atomic cooling driven collapseof gas in pre-galactic dm haloes with t_vir ~ 10000 k show that the gas loses90% and more of its angular momentum before rotational support sets in. in afraction of these haloes where the metallicity is low and uv radiationsuppresses h_2 cooling, conditions are thus very favourable for the rapidbuild-up of massive black holes. depending on the progression of metalenrichment, the continued suppression of h_2 cooling by external and internaluv radiation and the ability to trap the entropy produced by the release ofgravitational energy, the gas at the centre of the halo is expected to form asupermassive star, a stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-eddingtonaccretion rates or a compact star-cluster undergoing collisional run-away ofmassive stars at its centre. in all three cases a massive black hole ofinitially modest mass finds itself at the center of a rapid inflow of gas withinflow rates of ~ 1 m_solar\yr. the massive black hole will thus grow quicklyto a mass of 10^5 to 10^6 m_solar until further inflow is halted either byconsumption of gas by star formation or by the increasing energy and momentumfeedback from the growing massive black hole. conditions for the formation ofmassive seed black holes in this way are most favourable in haloes with t_vir ~15000 k and v_vir ~ 20 km\s with less massive haloes not allowing collapse ofgas by atomic cooling and more massive haloes being more prone tofragmentation. this should imprint a characteristic mass on the mass spectrumof an early population of massive black hole seeds in pre-galactic haloes whichwill later grow into the observed population of supermassive black holes ingalactic bulges.
