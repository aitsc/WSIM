0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0902.3392	evolution of cluster red-sequence galaxies from redshift 0.8 to 0.4:  ages, metallicities and morphologies	we present a comprehensive analysis of the stellar population properties(age, metallicity and the alpha-element enhancement [e/fe]) and morphologies ofred-sequence galaxies in 24 clusters and groups from z~0.75 to z~0.45. thedataset, consisting of 215 spectra drawn from the eso distant cluster survey,constitutes the largest spectroscopic sample at these redshifts for which suchan analysis has been conducted. analysis reveals that the evolution of thestellar population properties of red-sequence galaxies depend on their mass:while the properties of most massive are well described by passive evolutionand high-redshift formation, the less massive galaxies require a more extendedstar formation history. we show that these scenarios reproduce the index-sigmarelations as well as the galaxy colours. the two main results of this work are(1) the evolution of the line-strength indices for the red-sequence galaxiescan be reproduced if 40% of the galaxies with sigma &lt; 175 km/s entered thered-sequence between z=0.75 to z=0.45, in agreement with the fraction derivedin studies of the luminosity functions, and (2) the percentage the red-sequencegalaxies exhibiting early-type morphologies (e and s0) decreases by 20% fromz=0.75 to z=0.45. this can be understood if the red-sequence gets populated atlater times with disc galaxies whose star formation has been quenched. weconclude that the processes quenching star formation do not necessarily producea simultaneous morphological transformation of the galaxies entering thered-sequence.

0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0906.4443	very deep spectroscopy of the coma cluster line of sight: exploring new  territories	environmental effects have an important influence on cluster galaxies, butstudies at very faint magnitudes (r&gt;21) are almost exclusively based onimaging. we present here a very deep spectroscopic survey of galaxies on theline of sight to coma, based on redshifts obtained with vlt/vimos for 715galaxies in the unprecedented magnitude range 21&lt;r&lt;23 (absolute magnitude -14to -12). we confirm the substructures previously identified in coma by adami etal. (2005a), and identify three new ones. we detect many groups behind coma: alarge structure at z~0.5, the sdss great wall, and a large and very youngstructure at z~0.054. these structures account for the mass maps derived from arecent weak lensing analysis by gavazzi et al. (2009). the orbits of dwarfgalaxies are probably anisotropic and radial, and could originate from fieldgalaxies radially falling into the cluster. spectral characteristics of comadwarf galaxies show that red or absorption line galaxies have larger stellarmasses and are older than blue or emission line galaxies. r&lt;22 galaxies showless prominent absorption lines than r&gt;22 galaxies. this trend is less clearfor field galaxies, suggesting that part of the faint coma galaxies could havebeen recently injected from the field following the ngc 4911 group infall. wepresent a list of five ultra compact dwarf galaxy candidates. we also globallyconfirm spectroscopically our previous results on the galaxy luminosityfunctions and find that dwarf galaxies follow a red sequence similar to thatdrawn by bright galaxies. dwarf galaxies are very abundant in coma, and arepartly field galaxies that have fallen onto the cluster along filaments.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.3905	the role of environment in the morphological transformation of galaxies  in 9 intermediate redshift clusters	[abridged] we analyze a sample of 9 massive clusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6 observedwith megacam in 4 photometric bands (g,r,i,z) from the core to a radius of 5mpc (~4000 galaxies). galaxy cluster candidates are selected using photometricredshifts computed with hyperz. morphologies are estimated with galsvm in twobroad morphological types (early-type and late-type). we examine themorphological composition of the red-sequence and the blue-cloud and study therelations between galaxies and their environment through the morphology-densityrelations (t-sigma) and the morphology-radius relation (t-r) in a mass limitedsample (log(m/msol)&gt;9.5). we find that the red sequence is already in place atz~0.5 and it is mainly composed of very massive (log(m/msol)&gt;11.3) early-typegalaxies. these massive galaxies seem to be already formed when they enter thecluster, probably in infalling groups, since the fraction remains constant withthe cluster radius. their presence in the cluster center could be explained bya segregation effect reflecting an early assembly history. any evolution thattakes place in the galaxy cluster population occurs therefore at lower masses(10.3&lt;log(m/msol)&lt;11.3). for these galaxies, the evolution, is mainly driven bygalaxy-galaxy interactions in the outskirts as revealed by the t-sigmarelation. finally, the majority of less massive galaxies (9.5&lt;log(m/msol)&lt;10.3)are late-type galaxies at all locations, suggesting that they have not startedthe morphological transformation yet even if this low mass bin might beaffected by incompleteness.

0707.0566	coma cluster object populations down to m_r~-9.5	this study follows a recent analysis of the galaxy luminosity functions andcolour-magnitude red sequences in the coma cluster (adami et al. 2007). weanalyze here the distribution of very faint galaxies and globular clusters inan east-west strip of $\sim 42 \times 7$ arcmin$^2$ crossing the coma clustercenter (hereafter the cs strip) down to the unprecedented faint absolutemagnitude of m$_r \sim -9.5$. this work is based on deep images obtained at thecfht with the cfh12k camera in the b, r, and i bands. the analysis shows thatthe observed properties strongly depend on the environment, and thus on thecluster history. when the cs is divided into four regions, the westernmostregion appears poorly populated, while the regions around the brightestgalaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 (ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 being masked) aredominated by faint blue galaxies. they show a faint luminosity function slopeof -2, very significantly different from the field estimates. results arediscussed in the framework of galaxy destruction (which can explain part of thevery faint galaxy population) and of structures infalling on to coma.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.4910	looking for the first galaxies: lensing or blank fields?	the identification and study of the first galaxies remains one of the mostexciting topics in observational cosmology. the determination of the bestpossible observing strategies is a very important choice in order to build up arepresentative sample of spectroscopically confirmed sources at high-z (z&gt;7),beyond the limits of present-day observations. this paper is intended toprecisely adress the relative efficiency of lensing and blank fields in theidentification and study of galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12. the detection efficiency andfield-to-field variance are estimated from direct simulations of both blank andlensing fields observations. the presence of a strong-lensing cluster along theline of sight has a dramatic effect on the number of observed sources, with apositive magnification bias in typical ground-based ``shallow'' surveys(ab&lt;~25.5). the positive magnification bias increases with the redshift ofsources and decreases with both depth of the survey and the size of thesurveyed area. the maximum efficiency is reached for lensing clusters atz~0.1-0.3. observing blank fields in shallow surveys is particularlyinefficient as compared to lensing fields if the uv lf for lbgs is stronglyevolving at z&gt;~7. also in this case, the number of z&gt;8 sources expected at thetypical depth of jwst (ab~28-29) is much higher in lensing than in blank fields(e.g. a factor of ~10 for ab&lt;~28). blank field surveys with a large field ofview are needed to prove the bright end of the lf at z&gt;6-7, whereas lensingclusters are particularly useful for exploring the mid to faint end of the lf.

0910.5418	photometric redshifts and cluster tomography in the eso distant cluster  survey	this paper reports the results obtained on the photometric redshiftsmeasurement and accuracy, and cluster tomography in the eso distant clustersurvey (ediscs) fields. photometric redshifts were computed using twoindependent codes (hyperz and g. rudnick's code). the accuracy of photometricredshifts was assessed by comparing our estimates with the spectroscopicredshifts of ~1400 galaxies in the 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 domain. the accuracy for galaxiesfainter than the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degradedversion of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample. the accuracyof photometric redshifts is typically sigma(delta z/(1+z)) ~ 0.05+/-0.01,depending on the field, the filter set, and the spectral type of the galaxies.the quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two insigma(delta z/(1+z)) between the brightest (i~22) and the faintest (i~24-24.5)galaxies in the ediscs sample. the photometric determination of clusterredshifts in the ediscs fields using a simple algorithm based on photoz is inexcellent agreement with the spectroscopic values (delta(z) ~0.03-0.04 in thehigh-z sample and ~0.05 in the low-z sample). we also developed a method thatuses both photz codes jointly to reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter thanthe spectroscopic limit. when applied to the spectroscopic sample, this methodrejects ~50-90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retainingat least 90% of all confirmed members. photometric redshifts are found to beparticularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies inlarge surveys. they enable efficient and complete pre-selection of clustermembers for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the clusterredshifts, and provide a means of determining cluster membership.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1001.2168	infrared properties of the sdss-maxbcg galaxy clusters	the physics of galaxy clusters has proven to be influenced by severalprocesses connected with their galactic component which pollutes the icm withmetals, stars and dust. however, it is not clear whether the presence ofdiffuse dust can play a role in clusters physics since a characterisation ofthe ir properties of galaxy clusters is yet to be completely achieved. we focuson the recent work of giard et al. (2008) who performed a stacking analysis ofthe iras data in the direction of several thousands of galaxy clusters,providing a statistical characterisation of their ir luminosity and redshiftevolution. we model the ir properties of the galactic population of thesdss-maxbcg clusters (0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3) in order to check if it accounts for theentire observed signal and to constrain the possible presence of othercomponents, like dust in the icm. starting from the optical properties of thegalaxy members, we estimate their emission in the 60 and 100 micron iras bandsmaking use of modeled seds of different spectral types (e/s0, sa, sb, sc andstarburst). we also consider the evolution of the galacticpopulation/luminosity with redshift. our results indicate that the galacticemission, which is dominated by the contribution of star-forming galaxies, isconsistent with the observed signal. in fact, our model slightly overestimatesthe observed fluxes, with the excess being concentrated in low-redshiftclusters (z &lt;~ 0.17). this indicates that, if present, the ir emission fromintracluster dust must be very small. we obtain an upper limit on thedust-to-gas mass ratio in the icm of z_d &lt;~ 5 10^-5. the excess in luminosityobtained at low redshift constitutes an indication that the cluster environmentis driving a process of star-formation quenching in its galaxy members.

1002.4299	ultraluminous x-ray sources out to z~0.3 in the cosmos field	using chandra observations we have identified a sample of seven off-nuclearx-ray sources, in the redshift range z=0.072-0.283, located within opticallybright galaxies in the cosmos survey. using the multi-wavelength coverageavailable in the cosmos field, we study the properties of the host galaxies ofthese ulxs. in detail, we derived their star formation rate from h_alphameasurements and their stellar masses using sed fitting techniques with the aimto compute the probability to have an off-nuclear source based on the hostgalaxy properties. we divide the host galaxies in different morphologicalclasses using the available acs/hst imaging. we find that our ulxs candidatesare located in regions of the sfr versus m$_star$ plane where one or moreoff-nuclear detectable sources are expected. from a morphological analysis ofthe acs imaging and the use of rest-frame colours, we find that our ulxs arehosted both in late and early type galaxies. finally, we find that the fractionof galaxies hosting a ulx ranges from ~0.5% to ~0.2% going from l[0.5-2 kev]=3x 10^39 erg s^-1 to l[0.5-2 kev]= 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1004.2790	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field (xmm-cosmos):  demography and multiwavelength properties of obscured and unobscured luminous  agn	we report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ksec),contiguous (2 deg^2) xmm-newton survey of the cosmos field. xmm-newton hasdetected ~800 x-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5x10^{-16},~3x10^{-15}, and ~7x10^{-15} erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kevbands, respectively. the work is complemented by an extensive collection ofmulti-wavelength data from 24 micron to uv, available from the cosmos survey,for each of the x-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for ~50% ofthe sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. the xmm andmultiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the x-ray sourceshave optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have irac counterparts, and 1394 (~78%)have mips 24micron detections. thanks to the redshift completeness (almost100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the x-rayluminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density oflogl_x&gt;44.5 agn is at z~2. spectroscopically-identified obscured and unobscuredagn, as well as normal and starforming galaxies, present well-defined opticaland infrared properties. we devised a robust method to identify a sample of~150 high redshift (z&gt;1), obscured agn candidates for which opticalspectroscopy is not available. we were able to determine that the fraction ofthe obscured agn population at the highest (l_x&gt;10^{44} erg s^{-1}) x-rayluminosity is ~15-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providingan important observational constraint for x-ray background synthesis. westudied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energydistribution of a prototypical type 2 qso, caught in a stage transitioning frombeing starburst dominated to agn dominated, which was possible to isolate onlythanks to the combination of x-ray and infrared observations.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1009.0645	the fundamental plane of ediscs galaxies - the effect of size evolution	we study the evolution of spectral early-type galaxies in clusters, groupsand the field up to redshift 0.9 using the ediscs dataset. we measure re, ie,and sigma for 154 cluster and 68 field galaxies. we study the evolution of thezero point of the fundamental plane (fp) and confirm results in the literature,but now also for the low cluster velocity dispersion regime. the mass-to-lightratio varies as delta log m/l_b=(-0.54+-0.01)z=(-1.61+-0.01)log(1+z) inclusters, independent of their velocity dispersion. the evolution is stronger(delta log m/l_b=(-0.76+-0.01)z=(-2.27+-0.03)log(1+z)) for field galaxies. thefp residuals correlate with galaxy mass and become progressively negative atlow masses. the effect is visible at z&gt;=0.7 for cluster galaxies and at z&gt;=0.5for field galaxies. we investigate the size evolution of our galaxy sample. wefind that the half-luminosity radius for a galaxy with a dynamical or stellarmass of 2x10^11 msol varies as (1+z)^{-1.0+-0.3} for both cluster and fieldgalaxies. at the same time, stellar velocity dispersions grow with redshift, as(1+z)^{0.59+-0.10} at constant dynamical mass, and as (1+z)^{0.34+- 0.14} atconstant stellar mass. the measured size evolution reduces to re (1+z)^{-0.5+-0.2} and sigma (1+z)^{0.41+-0.08}, at fixed dynamical masses, and re(1+z)^{-0.68+-0.4} and sigma (1+z)^{0.19+-0.10}, at fixed stellar masses, whenthe progenitor bias (galaxies that locally are of spectroscopic early-type, butnot very old, disappear from the ediscs high-redshift sample; these galaxiestend to be large in size) is taken into account. taken together, the variationsin size and velocity dispersion imply that the luminosity evolution withredshift derived from the zero point of the fp is somewhat milder than thatderived without taking these variations into account.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.2908	a bright z=5.2 lensed submillimeter galaxy in the field of abell 773:  hlsj091828.6+514223	during our herschel lensing survey (hls) of massive galaxy clusters, we havediscovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster abell 773,which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=5.2429.this source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered byherschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mjy at 500\micron)and its high redshift. the dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not thecluster itself. the source has a far-infrared (fir) luminosity of l_fir= 1.110^{14}/\mu lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. wereport here the redshift identification through co lines with the iram-30m, andthe analysis of the gas excitation, based on co(7-6), co(6-5), co(5-4) detectedat iram and the co(2-1) at the evla. all lines decompose into a wide and strongred component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ulirg) co-to-h2 conversion ratio, the h2mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu mo, of which one third is in a cool component. from theci line we derive a ci/h2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that inother ulirgs. the h2o line is strong only in the red velocity component, withan intensity ratio i(h_2o)/i(co) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local firradiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (agn) component. we detect the[nii]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. it shows comparable blue andred components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gasflows.

1205.1064	the cosmos density field: a reconstruction using both weak lensing and  galaxy distributions	the cosmos field has been the subject of a wide range of observations, with anumber of studies focusing on reconstructing the 3d dark matter density field.typically, these studies have focused on one given method or tracer. in thispaper, we reconstruct the distribution of mass in the cosmos field out to aredshift z=1 by combining hubble space telescope weak lensing measurements withzcosmos spectroscopic measurements of galaxy clustering. the distribution ofgalaxies traces the distribution of mass with high resolution (particularly inredshift, which is not possible with lensing), and the lensing data empiricallycalibrates the mass normalisation (bypassing the need for theoretical models).two steps are needed to convert a galaxy survey into a density field. the firststep is to create a smooth field from the galaxy positions, which is a pointfield. we investigate four possible methods for this: (i) gaussian smoothing,(ii) convolution with truncated isothermal sphere, (iii) fifth nearestneighbour smoothing and (iv) a muliti-scale entropy method. the second step isto rescale this density field using a bias prescription. we calculate theoptimal bias scaling for each method by comparing predictions from the smootheddensity field with the measured weak lensing data, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.in general, we find scale-independent bias for all the smoothing schemes, to aprecision of 10%. for the nearest neighbour smoothing case, we find the bias tobe 2.51\pm 0.25. we also find evidence for a strongly evolving bias, increasingby a factor of ~3.5 between redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;0.8. we believe this strong evolutioncan be explained by the fact that we use a flux limited sample to build thedensity field.

1205.4187	the bright-end of the luminosity function at z~9	we report new constraints on the galaxy luminosity function at z~9 based onobservations carried out with eso/vlt fors2, hawk-i and x-shooter around thelensing cluster a2667, as part of our project aimed at selecting z~7-10candidates accessible to spectroscopy. only one j-dropout source was selectedin this field fulfilling the color and magnitude criteria. this source wasrecently confirmed as a mid-z interloper based on x-shooter spectroscopy. thedepth and the area covered by our survey are well suited to set strongconstraints on the bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function and hence onthe star formation history at very high redshift. the non-detection of reliablej-dropout sources over the ~36arcmin2 field of view towards a2667 was used tocarefully determine the lens-corrected effective volume and the correspondingupper-limit on the density of sources. the strongest limit is obtained forphi(m_{1500}=-21.4+/-0.50)&lt;6.70x10^{-6}mpc^{-3}mag^{-1} at z~9. amaximum-likelihood fit of the luminosity function using all available datapoints including the present new result yields m*&gt;-19.7 with fixed alpha=-1.74and phi*=1.10x10^{-3}mpc^{-3}. the corresponding star formation rate densityshould be rho_{sfr}&lt;5.97x10^{-3}m_{solar}/yr/mpc^{3} at z~9. these results arein good agreement with the most recent estimates already published in thisrange of redshift and for this luminosity domain. this new result confirms thedecrease in the density of luminous galaxies at very high-redshift, henceproviding strong constraints for the design of future surveys aiming to explorethe very high-redshift universe.

1207.0002	the zcosmos 20k group catalog	we present an optical group catalog between 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1 based on 16,500high-quality spectroscopic redshifts in the completed zcosmos-bright survey.the catalog published herein contains 1498 groups in total and 192 groups withmore than five observed members. the catalog includes both group properties andthe identification of the member galaxies. based on mock catalogs, thecompleteness and purity of groups with three and more members should be bothabout 83% with respect to all groups that should have been detectable withinthe survey, and more than 75% of the groups should exhibit a one-to-onecorrespondence to the "real" groups. particularly at high redshift, there areapparently more galaxies in groups in the cosmos field than expected from mockcatalogs. we detect clear evidence for the growth of cosmic structure over thelast seven billion years in the sense that the fraction of galaxies that arefound in groups (in volume-limited samples) increases significantly with cosmictime. in the second part of the paper, we develop a method for associatinggalaxies that only have photo-z to our spectroscopically identified groups. weshow that this leads to improved definition of group centers, improvedidentification of the most massive galaxies in the groups, and improvedidentification of central and satellite galaxies, where we define the former tobe galaxies at the minimum of the gravitational potential wells. subsamples ofcentrals and satellites in the groups can be defined with purities up to 80%,while a straight binary classification of all group and non-group galaxies intocentrals and satellites achieves purities of 85% and 75%, respectively, for thespectroscopic sample.

1207.0005	a group-galaxy cross-correlation function analysis in zcosmos	we present a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis using a group catalogproduced from the 16,500 spectra from the optical zcosmos galaxy survey. ouraim is to perform a consistency test in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8between the clustering strength of the groups and mass estimates that are basedon the richness of the groups. we measure the linear bias of the groups bymeans of a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis and convert it into massusing the bias-mass relation for a given cosmology, checking the systematicerrors using realistic group and galaxy mock catalogs. the measured bias forthe zcosmos groups increases with group richness as expected by the theory ofcosmic structure formation and yields masses that are reasonably consistentwith the masses estimated from the richness directly, considering the scatterthat is obtained from the 24 mock catalogs. an exception are the richest groupsat high redshift (estimated to be more massive than 10^13.5 m_sun), for whichthe measured bias is significantly larger than for any of the 24 mock catalogs(corresponding to a 3-sigma effect), which is attributed to the extremely largestructure that is present in the cosmos field at z ~ 0.7. our results are ingeneral agreement with previous studies that reported unusually strongclustering in the cosmos field.

1210.0334	the cosmic evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in star-forming  galaxies over the past 10 gyrs	the chemical evolution of galaxies on a cosmological timescale is still amatter of debate despite the increasing number of available data provided byspectroscopic surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts. thefundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicityrelation (mzr) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversialresults about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at agiven stellar mass. in this work we shed some light on this issue using thecompleteness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zcosmos survey and usingfor the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (n/o) as a tracer of the gasphase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formationrate. emission-line galaxies both in the sdss and 20k zcosmos bright surveywere used to study the evolution from the local universe of the $mzr up to aredshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygenratio (mnor) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the n2s2 parameter. all thephysical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,including stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and n/o, werecalculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. we confirmthe trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in ayounger universe. this trend is even observed when taking possible selectioneffects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formationrates for galaxies at higher redshifts. we also find a significant evolution ofthe mnor up to z = 0.4. taking the slope of the o/h vs. n/o relation intoaccount for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution ofthe mnor is consistent with the trends found for both the mzr and itsequivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on sfr.

1210.2723	proto-groups at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3 in the zcosmos-deep sample	we identify 42 candidate groups lying between 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.0 from a sample of 3502galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zcosmos-deep redshift surveywithin the same redshift interval. these systems contain three to fivespectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (inphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. based on extensive analysis ofmock catalogues that have been generated from the millennium simulation, weexamine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and whatthey will evolve into down to the present epoch. although few of the "member"galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, andalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the samehalo by the present epoch. most of the candidate groups can therefore bedescribed as "proto-groups". an estimate of the overdensities is alsoconsistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of theassembly process. we also examine present-day haloes and ask whether theirprogenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. for present-dayhaloes between 10^14-10^15msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst ourcandidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had beenfully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken asrepresentative of a large fraction of such systems. there is a clear excess ofmassive galaxies above 10^10msun around the locations of the candidate groupsin a large independent cosmos photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in thislatter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. this ishowever consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellitegalaxies, as indicated at z&lt;1, if the candidate groups are indeed only startingto be assembled.

1211.5607	the colors of central and satellite galaxies in zcosmos out to z ~ 0.8  and implications for quenching	we examine the red fraction of central and satellite galaxies in the largezcosmos group catalog out to z ~ 0.8 correcting for both the incompleteness instellar mass and for the less than perfect purities of the central andsatellite samples. we show that, at all masses and at all redshifts, thefraction of satellite galaxies that have been quenched, i.e., are red, issystematically higher than that of centrals, as seen locally in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the satellite quenching efficiency, which is theprobability that a satellite is quenched because it is a satellite rather thana central, is, as locally, independent of stellar mass. furthermore, theaverage value is about 0.5, which is also very similar to that seen in thesdss. we also construct the mass functions of blue and red centrals andsatellites and show that these broadly follow the predictions of the peng etal. analysis of the sdss groups. together, these results indicate that theeffect of the group environment in quenching satellite galaxies was verysimilar when the universe was about a half its present age, as it is today.

1304.2776	investigating the relationship between agn activity and stellar mass in  zcosmos galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1 using emission line diagnostic diagrams	we investigate the link between agn activity, star-formation and stellar massof the host galaxy at 0&lt;z&lt;1, looking for spectroscopic traces of agn and agingof the host. this work provides an extension of the existing studies at z&lt;0.1and contributes to shed light on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts. weused the zcosmos 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z&lt;1. we divided thesample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with animproved s/n. we exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate agnfrom star-forming galaxies. we found indication of a role for the total galaxystellar mass in leading galaxy classification. stacked spectra show agnsignatures above the log m_*/m_sun&gt;10.2 threshold. moreover, the stellarpopulations of agn hosts are found to be older with respect to star-forming andcomposites galaxies. this could be due to the the tendency of agn to reside inmassive hosts. the dependence of the agn classification on the stellar mass isin agreement with what has been already found in previous studies. it isconsistent with, together with the evidence of older stellar populationsinhabiting the agn-like galaxies, the downsizing scenario. in particular, ourevidence points to an evolutionary scenario where the agn-feedback is capableof quenching the star formation in the most massive galaxies. therefore, theagn-feedback is the best candidate for initiating the passive evolutionaryphase of galaxies.

1305.6167	obscured agn at z~1 from the zcosmos-bright survey i. selection and  optical properties of a [ne v]-selected sample	a sample of 94 narrow line agn with 0.65&lt;z&lt;1.20 has been selected from the20k-bright zcosmos galaxy sample by detection of the high-ionization [nev]3426line. taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the cosmosfield, the properties of the [nev]-selected type-2 agn have been investigated,focusing on their host galaxies, x-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.finally, the diagnostic developed by gilli et al. (2010), based on the x-ray to[nev] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavilyobscured agn. we found that [ne v]-selected narrow line agn have seyfert 2-likeoptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-formingcomponent. the acs morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectraindicate a preference for our type-2 agn to be hosted in early-spirals withstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)msun, on average higher than those ofthe galaxy parent sample. the fraction of galaxies hosting [nev]-selectedobscured agn increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at2x10^11 msun. a comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows thatthe detection of the [ne v] line is an effective method to select agn in theoptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provideby itself a complete census of agn2. finally, the high fraction of[nev]-selected type-2 agn not detected in medium-deep chandra observations(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of compton-thick sources in our sample.the presence of a population of heavily obscured agn is corroborated by thex-ray to [nev] ratio; we estimated, by mean of x-ray stacking technique andsimulations, that the compton-thick fraction in our sample of type-2 agn is43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the xrb synthesismodels.

1307.4402	zcosmos 20k: satellite galaxies are the main drivers of environmental  effects in the galaxy population at least to z~0.7	we explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7 using the final zcosmos-bright data set. using the red fraction ofgalaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction ofred galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity and with the stellarmass, consistent with previous works. as at lower redshift, the red fractionappears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of twoprocesses: mass and environmental quenching. the parameters describing theseappear to be essentially the same at z~0.7 as locally. we explore the relationbetween red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellitegalaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in thecentral-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samplesmatched in stellar mass. there is little evidence for a dependence of the redfraction of centrals on overdensity. satellites are consistently redder at alloverdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency increases withoverdensity at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4. this is less marked at higher redshift, but both arenevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. at a givenstellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites also increases withthe overdensity. at a given overdensity and mass, the obtained relation betweenthe environmental quenching and the satellite fraction agrees well with thesatellite quenching efficiency, demonstrating that the environmental quenchingin the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced throughthe satellite quenching process at least up to z=0.7. however, despite theunprecedented size of our high redshift samples, the associated statisticaluncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood asapproximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

0802.4292	strong lensing in abell 1703: constraints on the slope of the inner dark  matter distribution	in this article, we apply strong lensing techniques in abell 1703, a massivex-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.28. our analysis is based on imaging databoth from space and ground in 8 bands, complemented with a spectroscopicsurvey. abell 1703 looks rather circular from the general shape of its multiplyimaged systems and present a dominant giant elliptical cd galaxy in its centre.this cluster exhibits a remarkable bright 'central ring' formed by 4 brightimages at z_{spec}=0.888 located very close to the cd galaxy, providingobservational constraints that are potentially very interesting to probe thecentral mass distribution. the stellar contribution from the cd galaxy (~1.2510^{12} m_{sun} within 7") is accounted for in our parametric mass modelling,and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described usinga generalized nfw profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope \alpha.we find that within the range where observational constraints are present (from~5" to ~50"), the slope of the dark matter distribution in abell1703 is equalto 1.09^{+0.05}_{-0.11} (3\sigma confidence level). the concentration parameteris equal to c_{200} ~ 3.5, and the scale radius is constrained to be largerthan the region where observational constraints are available. within thisradius, the 2d mass is equal to m(50")=2.4 10^{14} m_{\sun}. we cannot draw anyconclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results fromrealistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison.we advocate the need for a sample of observed and simulated unimodal relaxedgalaxy clusters in order to make reliable comparisons, and potentially providea test of cosmological models.

1409.2900	characterizing sl2s galaxy groups using the einstein radius	we analyzed the einstein radius, $\theta_e$, in our sample of sl2s galaxygroups, and compared it with $r_a$ (the distance from the arcs to the center ofthe lens), using three different approaches: 1.- the velocity dispersionobtained from weak lensing assuming a singular isothermal sphere profile($\theta_{e,i}$), 2.- a strong lensing analytical method ($\theta_{e,ii}$)combined with a velocity dispersion-concentration relation derived fromnumerical simulations designed to mimic our group sample, 3.- strong lensingmodeling ($\theta_{e,iii}$) of eleven groups (with four new models presented inthis work) using hst and cfht images. finally, $r_a$ was analyzed as a functionof redshift $z$ to investigate possible correlations with l, n, and therichness-to-luminosity ratio (n/l). we found a correlation between $\theta_{e}$and $r_a$, but with large scatter. we estimate $\theta_{e,i}$ = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.9)+ (0.7 $\pm$ 0.2)$r_a$, $\theta_{e,ii}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (1.1 $\pm$0.4)$r_a$, and $\theta_{e,iii}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (0.9 $\pm$ 0.3)$r_a$ foreach method respectively. we found a weak evidence of anti-correlation between$r_a$ and $z$, with log$r_a$ = (0.58$\pm$0.06) - (0.04$\pm$0.1)$z$, suggestinga possible evolution of the einstein radius with $z$, as reported previously byother authors. our results also show that $r_a$ is correlated with l and n(more luminous and richer groups have greater $r_a$), and a possiblecorrelation between $r_a$ and the n/l ratio. our analysis indicates that $r_a$is correlated with $\theta_e$ in our sample, making $r_a$ useful tocharacterize properties like l and n (and possible n/l) in galaxy groups.additionally, we present evidence suggesting that the einstein radius evolveswith $z$.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

1510.01585	multi-wavelength characterisation of z~2 clustered, dusty star forming  galaxies discovered by planck	(abridged) we report the discovery of phz g95.5-61.6, a complex structuredetected in emission in the planck all-sky survey that corresponds to twoover-densities of high-redshift galaxies. this is the first source from theplanck catalogue of high-z candidates that has been completely characterisedwith follow-up observations from the optical to the sub-millimetre domain.herschel/spire observations at 250, 350 and 500 microns reveal the existence offive sources producing a 500 microns emission excess that spatially correspondsto the candidate proto-clusters discovered by planck. further observations atcfht in the optical bands (g and i) and in the near infrared (j, h and k_s),plus mid infrared observations with irac/spitzer (at 3.6 and 4.5 microns)confirm that the sub-mm red excess is associated with an over-density ofcolour-selected galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy of 13 galaxies withvlt/x-shooter establishes the existence of two high-z structures: one at z~1.7(three confirmed member galaxies), the other at z~2.0 (six confirmed members).this double structure is also seen in the photometric redshift analysis of asample of 127 galaxies located inside a circular region of 1'-radius containingthe five herschel/spire sources, where we found a double-peaked excess ofgalaxies at z~1.7 and z~2.0 with respect to the surrounding region. theseresults suggest that phz g95.5-61.6 corresponds to two accreting nodes, notphysically linked to one another, embedded in the large scale structure of theuniverse at z~2 and along the same line-of-sight. in conclusion, the data,methods and results illustrated in this pilot project confirm that planck datacan be used to detect the emission from clustered, dusty star forming galaxiesat high-z, and, thus, to pierce through the early growth of cluster-scalestructures.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0001538	quasar candidate multicolor selection technique: a different approach	we present a quasar candidate identification technique based on multicolorphotometry. the traditional multi-dimensional method (2 $\times$ n dimensions,where n is the number of the color-color diagrams) is reduced to aone-dimensional technique, which consists in a standard fitting procedure,where the observed spectral energy distributions are compared to quasarsimulated spectra and stellar templates. this new multicolor approach isfirstly applied to simulated catalogues and its {\it efficiency} is examined invarious redshift ranges, as a function of the filter combination and theavailable observing time for spectroscopy. we conclude that this method isbetter suited than the usual multicolor selection techniques to quasaridentification, especially for high-redshift quasars. the application of themethod to real quasar samples found in the literature results in an {\itefficiency} comparable to the one obtained from the use of color-colordiagrams. the major advantage of the new method is the estimation of the {\itphotometric} redshift of quasar candidates, enabling, in almost all cases,spectroscopy to be targeted to best suited wavelength ranges.

astro-ph;0009431	the coma cluster luminosity function from ultraviolet to near-infrared	[abridged] the coma cluster luminosity function (lf) from ultraviolet (2000aa) to the near-infrared (h band) is summarized. in the uv the lf is verysteep, much steeper than in the optical. the steep coma uv lf implies thatfaint and bright galaxies give similar contributions to the total uv flux andto the total metal production rate. the coma uv lf is dominated by star forminggalaxies, not by massive and large galaxies. the optical coma lf is relativelysteep (alpha=-1.4) over the 11 magnitudes sampled. we found a clear steeping ofthe fl going from b to r bands, indicative of the presence of a large number ofred dwarfs, as faint as three bright globular clusters. furthermore, usinghubble space telescope images, we discover that blends of globular clusters,not resolved in individual components due to seeing, look like dwarf galaxieswhen observed from the ground and are numerous and bright. the existence ofthese fake extended sources increases the steepness of the lf at faintmagnitudes, if not deal on. the near-infrared lf was computed on anear-infrared selected sample of galaxies which photometry is complete down tothe typical dwarf (m^*+5) luminosity. the coma lf can be described by aschechter function with intermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at m_h~-22mag. the shape of the coma lf in h band is quite similar to the one found inthe b band. the similarity of the lf in the optical and h bands implies that inthe central region of coma there is no new population of galaxies which is toofaint to be observed in the optical band (because dust enshrouded, forinstance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs.

astro-ph;0104477	vlt spectroscopy of galaxies lensed by abell ac114: implication for the  mass model and the study of low-luminosity galaxies at high-redshift	we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of faint lensedgalaxie s in the core of the galaxy cluster ac114 (z=0.312) obtained fromobservations w ith the fors1 spectrograph mounted on the vlt-antu. the galaxieswere chose n in areas close to the high-z critical lines predicted by thegravitational lens model of natarajan et al (nkse, 1998) for this cluster,according to both lensing and photometric redshift criteria. all the targetgalaxies are found to correspond to background galaxies with redshifts valuesin the [0.7, 3.5] interval. our spectroscopic observations confirm thepredicted lensing redshifts for 3 of the multiple-image galaxies, and togetherwith predictions of the nkse model led to the discovery of a new 5-imageconfiguration at redshift z=3.347. a revised nkse model, compatible with theredshift of this new multiple-image system, was generated and employed tocalculate the gravitational amplifications of all the observed galaxies. thegalaxies corresponding to the multiple-image systems are found to beintrinsically fainter, between 0.5 and 1.5 magnitudes, than the limitingmagnitudes of existing blank field studies. when all the observed backgroundgalaxies are considered, the resulting intrinsic absolute magnitudes range fromm_b~-22 to -19. therefore, a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosityhigh-z objects can actually be obtained, in agreement with theoreticalexpectations. this method can be used advantageously to probe the high redshiftuniverse and, in particular, its application to an ensemble of massive clustercores could constraint the faint end of luminosity function of high redshiftgalaxies.

astro-ph;0210547	physical properties of two low-luminosity z ~ 1.9 galaxies behind the  lensing cluster ac 114	we present vlt/isaac near-infrared spectroscopy of two gravitationally-lensedz ~ 1.9 galaxies, a2 and s2, located behind the cluster ac 114. thanks to largemagnification factors, we have been successful in detecting rest-frame opticalemission lines in star-forming galaxies 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than inprevious studies of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3. from the haluminosity, we estimate star formation rates (sfrs) which are 7 to 15 timeshigher than those inferred from the uv continuum flux at 1500 ang without dustextinction correction. the behavior of s2 and a2 in terms of o/h and n/oabundance ratios are very different, and they are also different from typicallbgs at z ~ 3. s2 is a low-metallicity object (z ~ 0.03 zsun) with a low n/oratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-poor nearby hii galaxies. incontrast, a2 is a high-metallicity galaxy (z ~ 1.3 zsun) with a high n/oabundance ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-rich starburstnucleus galaxies. the virial masses, derived from emission-line widths, are 0.5and 2.4 x 10^10 msun, for s2 and a2 respectively. thanks to the gravitationalamplification, the line profiles of s2 are spatially resolved, leading to avelocity gradient of +- 240 km/s, which yields a dynamical mass of ~ 1.3 x10^10 msun within the inner 1 kpc radius. combining these new data with thesample of lbgs at z ~ 3, we conclude that these three galaxies exhibitdifferent physical properties in terms of sfrs, abundance and mass-to-lightratios, and reddening. high-redshift galaxies of different luminosities couldthus have quite different star formation histories (abridged version).

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0512391	the evolution of the star formation activity in galaxies and its  dependence on environment	we study how the proportion of star-forming galaxies evolves between z=0.8and z=0 as a function of galaxy environment, using the [oii] line in emissionas a signature of ongoing star formation. our high-z dataset comprises 16clusters, 10 groups and another 250 galaxies in poorer groups and the field atz=0.4-0.8 from the eso distant cluster survey, plus another 9 massive clustersat similar redshifts. as a local comparison, we use samples of galaxy systemsselected from the sloan digital sky survey at 0.04&lt; z &lt; 0.08. at high-z mostsystems follow a broad anticorrelation between the fraction of star-forminggalaxies and the system velocity dispersion. at face value, this suggests thatat z=0.4-0.8 the mass of the system largely determines the proportion ofgalaxies with ongoing star formation. at these redshifts the strength of starformation (as measured by the [oii] equivalent width) in star-forming galaxiesis also found to vary systematically with environment. sloan clusters have muchlower fractions of star-forming galaxies than clusters at z=0.4-0.8 and, incontrast with the distant clusters, show a plateau for velocity dispersions $\ge 550 km s^-1$, where the fraction of galaxies with [oii] emission does notvary systematically with velocity dispersion. we quantify the evolution of theproportion of star-forming galaxies as a function of the system velocitydispersion and find it is strongest in intermediate-mass systems (sigma ~500-600 km s^-1 at z=0). to understand the origin of the observed trends, weuse the press-schechter formalism and the millennium simulation and show thatgalaxy star formation histories may be closely related to the growth history ofclusters and groups. we propose a scheme that is able to account for theobserved relations between the star-forming fraction and \sigma [abridged].

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0609391	spatial variations of the optical galaxy luminosity functions and red  sequences in the coma cluster: clues to its assembly history	clusters of galaxies are believed to be at the intersections of cosmologicalfilaments and to grow by accreting matter from these filaments. such continuousinfall has major consequences not only on clusters but also on the physics ofcluster galaxies. faint galaxies are particularly interesting as they are verysensitive to environmental effects, and may have a different behaviour fromthat of bright galaxies. the aim of this paper is to sample the coma clusterbuilding history, based on the analysis of galaxy luminosity functions and redsequences in the color magnitude relation down to faint magnitudes, which areprivileged tools for this purpose. the present analysis is based on deep(r~24), wide (~0.5 deg2) multiband (bvri vega system) images of the comacluster obtained with the cfh12k camera at the cfht. we have derived lfs andcmrs in twenty 10x10 arcmin2 regions and in larger regions. in all photometricbands, we found steeply rising lfs in the north-northeast half of the cluster(due to early type galaxies at bright magnitudes and due to late type galaxiesat the faint end), and much flatter lfs in the south-southwest region. althoughthe fine behaviour of the cmr rs is different in these two regions, a goodagreement is found in general between the rs computed for faint and for brightgalaxies. all these results can be interpreted consistently in the framework ofthe building up process previously proposed. the northern coma area is arelatively quiescent region while the southern area experiences severalinfalls.

astro-ph;9504038	dynamics of abell 2218 from optical and near-ir imagery of arc(let)s and  rosat/hri x-ray map	a mass model of the rich cluster a2218 is presented based on optical and newnear-infrared images of arc(let)s and the rosat/hri x-ray map. a lensing modelis proposed with two dark matter clumps, centered on the two bright galaxiesaround which the various arcs are observed. two of them, close to the mostmassive clump around the brightest galaxy, are required to be fold images,given their position angle with respect to the major axis. a third image foreach of the two arcs is then predicted to be on the opposite side of the majoraxis. both images are indeed found at the expected positions, with consistentmagnitudes, colors and shapes. one of the arcs has a known redshift of $0.7$,and the model predicts that the other arc should be at higher redshift, $z\approx 3$. photometric data in ubrzjk' indicates that a redshift close to 3 isindeed probable for this arc. the dark matter halo is found to be sharplypeaked on the giant central galaxy. the rosat/hri x-ray map shows a stronglyclumped image, poorly correlated with the cd light and the mass model on scalesbelow $\sim$ 200$h_{50}^{-1}$kpc, but similar to the distribution of galaxiesand the mass model when smoothed on this scale. the large degree of centralsubstructure implied helps to account for the discrepancy previously found (inthe two massive clusters a2218 \&amp; a1689) between the mass derived from thegravitational lenses and that derived from the x-ray profile and temperaturedistributions, in a model of hydrostatic equilibrium. most of the discrepancycan probably be explained by bulk motions and acceleration of the gas, andprojection effects enhancing the lensing power of the cluster.

(1996b). the resulting starformation rate density is at least 1.1 10^-2 h msun/yr/mpc^3 (1.8 10^-2 hmsun/yr/mpc^3) with q_0=0.1(0.5), slightly higher than the results by madau etal.

0811.2085	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. ii. extending the mass-metallicity relation to the range  z=0.89-1.24	aims. we present a continuation of our study about the relation betweenstellar mass and gas-phase metallicity in the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds). inthis work we extend the determination of metallicities up to redshift = 1.24for a sample of 42 star-forming galaxies with a mean redshift value of 0.99.methods. for a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use bothdiagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [oii] emission linesalong with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [oiii] and[neiii] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between balmer recombinationemission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive theirmetallicities. we derive stellar masses by fitting the whole spectral energydistribution with a set of stellar population synthesis models. results. thesenew methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higherredshift. we show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with moreestablished strong-line methods. taken together this allows us to study theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control ofsystematic uncertainties. we find an evolution with redshift of the averagemetallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for agiven stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dexlower than galaxies in the local universe. however we do not see anysignificant metallicity evolution between redshifts z = 0.7 (paper i) and z =1.0 (this paper). we find also the same flattening of the mass-metallicityrelation for the most massive galaxies as reported in paper i at lowerredshifts, but again no apparent evolution of the slope is seen between z = 0.7and z = 1.0.

0811.4480	on the nature of faint low surface brightness galaxies in the coma  cluster	this project is the continuation of our study of faint low surface brightnessgalaxies (flsbs) in one of the densest nearby galaxy regions known, the comacluster. our goal is to improve our understanding of the nature of theseobjects by comparing the broad band spectral energy distribution withpopulation synthesis models. the data were obtained with the megacam and cfh12kcameras at the cfht. we used the resulting photometry in 5 broad band filters(u*, b, v, r, and i), that included new u*-band data, to fit spectral models.with these spectral fits we inferred a cluster membership criterium, as well asthe ages, dust extinctions, and photometric types of these flsbs. we show thatabout half of the coma cluster flsbs have a spectral energy distribution wellrepresented in our template library while the other half present a flux deficitat ultraviolet wavelengths. among the well represented, ~80% are probably partof the coma cluster based on their spectral energy distribution. they arerelatively young (younger than 2.3 gyrs for 90% of the sample) non-starburstobjects. the later their type, the younger flsbs are. a significant part of theflsbs are quite dusty objects. flsbs are low stellar mass objects (the latertheir type the less massive they are), with stellar masses comparable toglobular clusters for the faintest ones. their characteristics are correlatedwith infall directions, confirming the disruptive origin for part of them.

0812.1033	a new window of exploration in the mass spectrum: strong lensing by  galaxy groups in the sl2s	the existence of strong lensing systems with einstein radii (re) covering thefull mass spectrum, from ~1-2" (produced by galaxy scale dark matter haloes) to&gt;10" (produced by galaxy cluster scale haloes) have long been predicted. manylenses with re around 1-2" and above 10" have been reported but very few inbetween. in this article, we present a sample of 13 strong lensing systems withre in the range 3"- 8", i.e. systems produced by galaxy group scale dark matterhaloes, spanning a redshift range from 0.3 to 0.8. this opens a new window ofexploration in the mass spectrum, around 10^{13}- 10^{14} m_{sun}, which is acrucial range for understanding the transition between galaxies and galaxyclusters. our analysis is based on multi-colour cfhtls images complemented withhst imaging and ground based spectroscopy. large scale properties are derivedfrom both the light distribution of the elliptical galaxies group members andweak lensing of the faint background galaxy population. on small scales, thestrong lensing analysis yields einstein radii between 2.5" and 8". on largerscales, the strong lenses coincide with the peak of the light distribution,suggesting that mass is traced by light. most of the luminosity maps havecomplicated shapes, indicating that these intermediate mass structures aredynamically young. fitting the reduced shear with a singular isothermal sphere,we find sigma ~ 500 km/s and an upper limit of ~900 km/s for the whole sample.the mass to light ratio for the sample is found to be m/l_i ~ 250 (solar units,corrected for evolution), with an upper limit of 500. this can be compared tomass to light ratios of small groups (with sigma ~ 300 km/s and galaxy clusterswith sigma &gt; 1000 km/s, thus bridging the gap between these mass scales.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
