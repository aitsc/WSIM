0901.1436	precision astrometry with the very long baseline array: parallaxes and  proper motions for 14 pulsars	astrometry can bring powerful constraints to bear on a variety of scientificquestions about neutron stars, including their origins, astrophysics,evolution, and environments. using phase-referenced observations at the vlba,in conjunction with pulsar gating and in-beam calibration, we have measured theparallaxes and proper motions for 14 pulsars. the smallest measured parallax inour sample is 0.13+-0.02 mas for psr b1541+09, which has a most probabledistance of 7.2+1.3-1.1 kpc. we detail our methods, including initial vlasurveys to select candidates and find in-beam calibrators, vlbaphase-referencing, pulsar gating, calibration, and data reduction. the use ofthe bootstrap method to estimate astrometric uncertainties in the presence ofunmodeled systematic errors is also described. based on our newmodel-independent estimates for distance and transverse velocity, weinvestigate the kinematics and birth sites of the pulsars and revisit models ofthe galactic electron density distribution. we find that young pulsars aremoving away from the galactic plane, as expected, and that age estimates fromkinematics and pulsar spindown are generally in agreement, with certain notableexceptions. given its present trajectory, the pulsar b2045-16 was plausiblyborn in the open cluster ngc 6604. for several high-latitude pulsars, thene2001 electron density model underestimates the parallax distances by a factorof two, while in others the estimates agree with or are larger than theparallax distances, suggesting that the interstellar medium is irregular onrelevant length scales. the vlba astrometric results for the recycled pulsarj1713+0747 are consistent with two independent estimates from pulse timing,enabling a consistency check between the different reference frames.

0908.1331	discovery of three pulsars from a galactic center pulsar population	we report the discovery of three pulsars whose large dispersion measures andangular proximity to \sgr indicate the existence of a galactic centerpopulation of neutron stars. the relatively long periods (0.98 to 1.48 s) mostlikely reflect strong selection against short-period pulsars from radio-wavescattering at the observation frequency of 2 ghz used in our survey with thegreen bank telescope. one object (psr j1746-2850i) has a characteristicspindown age of only 13 kyr along with a high surface magnetic field $\sim4\times 10^{13}$ g. it and a second object found in the same telescopepointing, psr j1746-2850ii (which has the highest known dispersion measureamong pulsars), may have originated from recent star formation in the arches orquintuplet clusters given their angular locations. along with a third object,psr j1745-2910, and two similar high-dispersion, long-period pulsars reportedby johnston et al. (2006), the five objects found so far are 10 to 15 arc minfrom \sgr, consistent with there being a large pulsar population in thegalactic center, most of whose members are undetectable in relativelylow-frequency surveys because of pulse broadening from the same scatteringvolume that angularly broadens \sgr and oh/ir masers.

0707.1778	angular broadening of intraday variable agn. ii. interstellar and  intergalactic scattering	we analyze a sample of 58 multi-wavelength, very long baseline arrayobservations of active galactic nuclei (agn) to determine their scatteringproperties. approximately 75% of the sample consists of agn that exhibitcentimeter-wavelength intraday variability (interstellar scintillation) whilethe other 25% do not show intraday variability. we find that interstellarscattering is measurable for most of these agn, and the typical broadeningdiameter is 2 mas at 1 ghz. we find that the scintillating agn are typically atlower galactic latitudes than the non-scintillating agn, consistent with thescenario that intraday variability is a propagation effect from the galacticinterstellar medium. the magnitude of the inferred interstellar broadeningmeasured toward the scintillating agn, when scaled to higher frequencies, iscomparable to the diameters inferred from analyses of the light curves for themore well-known intraday variable sources. however, we find no difference inthe amount of scattering measured toward the scintillating versusnon-scintillating agn. a consistent picture is one in which the scintillationresults from localized regions ("clumps") distributed throughout the galacticdisk, but which individually make little contribution to the angularbroadening. of the 58 agn observed, 37 (64%) have measured redshifts. at best,a marginal trend is found for scintillating (non-scintillating) agn to havesmaller (larger) angular diameters at higher redshifts. we also use ourobservations to try to constrain the possibility of intergalactic scattering.while broadly consistent with the scenario of a highly turbulent intergalacticmedium, our observations do not place significant constraints on itsproperties.

1010.3785	a measurement model for precision pulsar timing	this paper describes a comprehensive measurement model for the error budgetof pulse arrival times with emphasis on intrinsic pulse jitterand plasmapropagation effects (particularly interstellar scattering), which arestochastic in time and have diverse dependences on radio frequency. to reducetheir contribution, timing measurements can be made over a range of frequenciesthat depends on a variety of pulsar and instrumentation-dependent factors thatwe identify. a salient trend for high signal-to-noise measurements ofmillisecond pulsars is that time-of-arrival precision is limited either byirreducible interstellar scattering or by pulse-phase jitter caused by variableemission within pulsar magnetospheres. a cap on timing errors implies thatpulsars must be confined to low dispersion measures (dms) and observed at highfrequencies. use of wider bandwidths that increase signal-to-noise ratios willdegrade timing precision if nondispersive chromatic effects are not mitigated.the allowable region in the dm-frequency plane depends on how chromatic timingperturbations are addressed. without mitigation, observations at 1.4~ghz or5~ghz are restricted to $\dm\lesssim 30$ and $\lesssim 100~\dmu$, respectively.with aggressive mitigation of interstellar scattering and use of largetelescopes to provide adequate sensitivity at high frequencies (e.g. arecibo,fast, phase 1 of the ska, and the ska), pulsars with dms up to 500~$\dmu$ canbe used in precision timing applications. we analyze methods that fit arrivaltimes vs. frequency at a given epoch prior to multi-epoch fitting. while theterms of greatest astrophysical interest are achromatic (e.g. orbital andgravitational wave perturbations), measurements may ultimately be limited bysimilarly achromatic stochasticity in a pulsar's spin rate.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1106.4047	minimum requirements for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave  background using pulsars	we assess the detectability of a nanohertz gravitational wave (gw) backgroundwith respect to additive red and white noise in the timing of millisecondpulsars. we develop detection criteria based on the cross-correlation functionsummed over pulsar pairs in a pulsar timing array. the distribution ofcorrelation amplitudes is found to be non-gaussian and highly skewed, whichsignificantly influences detection and false-alarm probabilities. when onlywhite noise and gws contribute, our detection results are consistent with thosefound by others. red noise, however, drastically alters the results. we discussmethods to meet the challenge of gw detection ("climbing mount significance")by distinguishing between gw-dominated and red or white-noise limited regimes.we characterize detection regimes by evaluating the number of millisecondpulsars that must be monitored in a high-cadence, 5-year timing program for agw background spectrum $h_c(f) = a f^{-2/3}$ with $a = 10^{-15}$ yr$^{-2/3}$.unless a sample of 20 super-stable millisecond pulsars can be found --- thosewith timing residuals from red-noise contributions $\sigma_r \lesssim 20$ ns--- a much larger timing program on $\gtrsim 50 - 100$ msps will be needed. forother values of $a$, the constraint is $\sigma_r \lesssim 20 {\rm ns}(a/10^{-15} {\rm yr}^{-2/3})$. identification of suitable msps itself requiresan aggressive survey campaign followed by characterization of the level of spinnoise in the timing residuals of each object. the search and timing programswill likely require substantial fractions of time on new array telescopes inthe southern hemisphere as well as on existing ones.

1107.3086	prospects for high-precision pulsar timing	timing pulses of pulsars has proved to be a most powerful technique useful toa host of research areas in astronomy and physics. importantly, the precisionof this timing is not only affected by radiometer noise, but also by intrinsicpulse shape changes, interstellar medium (ism) evolution, instrumentaldistortions, etc. in this paper we review the known causes of pulse shapevariations and assess their effect on the precision and accuracy of a singlemeasurement of pulse arrival time with current instrumentation. throughout thisanalysis we use the brightest and most precisely timed millisecond pulsar(msp), psr j0437-4715, as a case study, and develop a set of diagnostic toolsto evaluate profile stability in timing observations. we conclude that mostcauses of distortion can be either corrected by state-of-the-art techniques ortaken into account in the estimation of time-of-arrival (toa) uncertainties.the advent of a new generation of radio telescopes (e.g. the square kilometrearray, ska), and their increase in collecting area has sparked speculationabout the timing precision achievable through increases in gain. based on ouranalysis of current data, we predict that for normal-brightness msps a toaprecision of between 80 and 230 ns can be achieved at 1.4 ghz with 10-minuteintegrations by the ska. the actual rms timing residuals for each pulsar willbe approximately at the same level only if all the other influences on timingprecision (e.g. ism, spin noise) are either corrected, modelled, or negligible.

1110.4759	profile shape stability and phase jitter analyses of millisecond pulsars	millisecond pulsars (msps) have been studied in detail since their discoveryin 1982. the integrated pulse profiles of msps appear to be stable, whichenables precision monitoring of the pulse times of arrival (toas). however, forindividual pulses the shape and arrival phase can vary dramatically, which isknown as pulse jitter. in this paper, we investigate the stability ofintegrated pulse profiles for 5 msps, and estimate the amount of jitter for psrj0437-4715. we do not detect intrinsic profile shape variation based onintegration times from ~10 to ~100 s with the provided instrumentalsensitivity. for psr j0437-4715 we calculate the jitter parameter to bef_j=0.067+-0.002, and demonstrate that the result is not significantly affectedby instrumental toa uncertainties. jitter noise is also found to be independentof observing frequency and bandwidth around 1.4 ghz on frequency scales of &lt;100mhz, which supports the idea that pulses within narrow frequency scale areequally jittered. in addition, we point out that pulse jitter would limit toacalculation for the timing observations with future telescopes like the squarekilometre array and the five hundred metre aperture spherical telescope. aquantitative understanding of pulse profile stability and the contribution ofjitter would enable improved toa calculations, which are essential for theongoing endeavours in pulsar timing, such as the detection of the stochasticgravitational wave background.

1111.4216	multiwavelength constraints on pulsar populations in the galactic center	the detection of radio pulsars within the central few parsecs of the galaxywould provide a unique probe of the gravitational and magneto-ionicenvironments in the galactic center (gc) and, if close enough to sgr a*,precise tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. while it isdifficult to find pulsars at radio wavelengths because of interstellarscattering, the payoff from detailed timing of pulsars in the gc warrants aconcerted effort. to motivate pulsar surveys and help define search parametersfor them, we constrain the pulsar number and spatial distribution using a widerange of multiwavelength measurements. these include the five known radiopulsars within 15 arcmin of sgr a*, radio and gamma-ray measurements of diffuseemission, non-detections in high frequency pulsar surveys of the centralparsec, a catalog of radio point sources from an imaging survey, infraredobservations of massive star populations in the central few parsecs, candidatepulsar wind nebulae in the inner 20 pc and estimates of the core-collapsesupernova rate based on x-ray measurements. we find that under currentobservational constraints, the inner parsec of the galaxy could harbor as manyas ~10^3 active radio pulsars that are beamed towards earth. such a largepopulation would distort the low-frequency measurements of both the intrinsicspectrum of sgr a* and the free-free absorption along the line of sight of sgra*.

1210.2469	the benefits of vlbi astrometry to pulsar timing array searches for  gravitational radiation	precision astrometry is an integral component of successful pulsar timingcampaigns. astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them asparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (toas). toasmeasured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield positionmeasurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. however, timing-basedastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which canbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitationalwave background. we investigate how noise of different spectral types isabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in theastrometric parameters. we find that commonly used techniques for fittingtiming models in the presence of red noise (cholesky whitening) prevent theabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baselineof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing withshorter pulsar data sets. independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi) is capable of providing position estimatesprecise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. wecompute a necessary transformation between the international celestialreference frame and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how thetransformation will improve in coming years. we find that incorporating vlbiastrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of yearsof timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noiseand could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fittiming residuals by factors of 20 or more.

1309.1982	modeling the non-recycled fermi gamma-ray pulsar population	we use fermi gamma-ray space telescope detections and upper limits onnon-recycled pulsars obtained from the large area telescope (lat) to constrainhow the gamma-ray luminosity l depends on the period p and the periodderivative \dot{p}. we use a bayesian analysis to calculate a best-fitluminosity law, or dependence of l on p and \dot{p}, including differentmethods for modeling the beaming factor. an outer gap (og) magnetospheregeometry provides the best-fit model, which is l \propto p^{-a} \dot{p}^{b}where a=1.36\pm0.03 and b=0.44\pm0.02, similar to but not identical to thecommonly assumed l \propto \sqrt{\dot{e}} \propto p^{-1.5} \dot{p}^{0.5}. givenupper limits on gamma-ray fluxes of currently known radio pulsars and using theog model, we find that about 92% of the radio-detected pulsars have gamma-raybeams that intersect our line of sight. by modeling the misalignment of radioand gamma-ray beams of these pulsars, we find an average gamma-ray beamingsolid angle of about 3.7{\pi} for the og model, assuming a uniform beam. usinglat-measured diffuse fluxes, we place a 2{\sigma} upper limit on the averagebraking index and a 2{\sigma} lower limit on the average surface magnetic fieldstrength of the pulsar population of 3.8 and 3.2 x 10^{10} g, respectively. wethen predict the number of non-recycled pulsars detectable by the lat based onour population model. using the two-year sensitivity, we find that the lat iscapable of detecting emission from about 380 non-recycled pulsars, including150 currently identified radio pulsars. using the expected five-yearsensitivity, about 620 non-recycled pulsars are detectable, including about 220currently identified radio pulsars. we note that these predictionssignificantly depend on our model assumptions.

1309.4673	pulse broadening measurements from the galactic center pulsar  j1745--2900	we present temporal scattering measurements of single pulses and averageprofiles of psr j1745--2900, a magnetar recently discovered only 3 arcsec awayfrom sagittarius a* (sgr a*), from 1.2 - 18.95 ghz using the effelsberg 100-mradio telescope, the nan\c{c}ay decimetric radio telescope, and the jodrellbank lovell telescope. single pulse analysis shows that the integrated pulseprofile above 2 ghz is dominated by pulse jitter, while below 2 ghz the pulseprofile shape is dominated by scattering. the high dispersion measure androtation measure of the magnetar suggest that it is close to sgr a* (within~0.1 pc). this is the first object in the gc with both pulse broadening andangular broadening measurements. we measure a pulse broadening spectral indexof alpha = -3.8 +/- 0.2 and a pulse broadening time scale at 1 ghz of tau_ghz =1.3 +/- 0.2 s, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the scatteringpredicted by the ne2001 model (cordes and lazio 2002). if this scatteringtimescale is representative of the gc as a whole, then previous surveys shouldhave detected many pulsars. the lack of detections implies either ourunderstanding of scattering in the gc is incomplete or there are fewer pulsarsin the gc than previously predicted. given that magnetars are a rare class ofradio pulsar, we believe that there are many canonical and millisecond pulsarsin the gc, and not surprisingly, scattering regions in the gc have complexspatial structures.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1404.5682	assessing pulsar timing array sensitivity to gravitational wave bursts  with memory	highly energetic astrophysical phenomena like supermassive black hole binary(smbhb) mergers are predicted to emit prodigious amounts of gravitational waves(gws). an anticipated component of the gravitational waveform known as "memory"is permanent and non-oscillatory. for smbhb mergers, the memory is createdprimarily during the most violent moments of the inspiral immediately precedingthe final plunge and ring-down when the strongest gravitational fields are atwork and the non-linearities of general relativity are most pronounced. theessentially time-domain nature of memory makes it forbiddingly difficult todetect with ground based gw detectors, leaving pulsar timing array (pta)experiments as the most promising means by which it may be detected andstudied. in this paper, we discuss how gw bursts with memory (bwms) influencepulsar timing experiments and develop methods to assess how sensitive moderntiming efforts are to such gw events. we discuss how pta searches for bwms canbe used to constrain the rate of bwms and how these constraints relate toinformation regarding the population of smbhbs.

1408.1694	a 24-hour global campaign to assess precision timing of the millisecond  pulsar j1713+0747	the radio millisecond pulsar j1713+0747 is regarded as one of thehighest-precision clocks in the sky, and is regularly timed for the purpose ofdetecting gravitational waves. the international pulsar timing arraycollaboration undertook a 24-hour global observation of psr j1713+0747 in aneffort to better quantify sources of timing noise in this pulsar, particularlyon intermediate (1 - 24 hr) timescales. we observed the pulsar continuouslyover 24 hr with the arecibo, effelsberg, gmrt, green bank, lofar, lovell,nancay, parkes, and wsrt radio telescopes. the combined pulse times-of-arrivalpresented here provide an estimate of what sources of timing noise, excludingdm variations, would be present as compared to an idealized root-n improvementin timing precision, where n is the number of pulses analyzed. in the case ofthis particular pulsar, we find that intrinsic pulse phase jitter dominatesarrival time precision when the s/n of single pulses exceeds unity, as measuredusing the eight telescopes that observed at l-band/1.4 ghz. we present firstresults of specific phenomena probed on the unusually long timescale (for asingle continuous observing session) of tens of hours, in particularinterstellar scintillation, and discuss the degree to which scintillation andprofile evolution affect precision timing. this paper presents the data set asa basis for future, deeper studies.

1411.1764	pulsar timing errors from asynchronous multi-frequency sampling of  dispersion measure variations	free electrons in the interstellar medium cause frequency-dependent delays inpulse arrival times due to both scattering and dispersion. multi-frequencymeasurements are used to estimate and remove dispersion delays. in this paper,we focus on the effect of any non-simultaneity of multi-frequency observationson dispersive delay estimation and removal. interstellar density variationscombined with changes in the line-of-sight from pulsar and observer motionscause dispersion measure variations with an approximately power-law powerspectrum, augmented in some cases by linear trends. we simulate time series,estimate the magnitude and statistical properties of timing errors that resultfrom non-simultaneous observations, and derive prescriptions for dataacquisition that are needed in order to achieve a specified timing precision.for nearby, highly stable pulsars, measurements need to be simultaneous towithin about one day in order that the timing error from asynchronous dmcorrection is less than about 10 ns. we discuss how timing precision improveswhen increasing the number of dual-frequency observations used in dispersionmeasure estimation for a given epoch. for a kolmogorov wavenumber spectrum, wefind about a factor of two improvement in precision timing when increasing fromtwo to three observations but diminishing returns thereafter.

1501.00281	observing radio pulsars in the galactic centre with the square kilometre  array	the discovery and timing of radio pulsars within the galactic centre is afundamental aspect of the ska science case, responding to the topic of "strongfield tests of gravity with pulsars and black holes" (kramer et al. 2004;cordes et al. 2004). pulsars have in many ways proven to be excellent tools fortesting the general theory of relativity and alternative gravity theories (seewex (2014) for a recent review). timing a pulsar in orbit around a companion,provides a unique way of probing the relativistic dynamics and spacetime ofsuch a system. the strictest tests of gravity, in strong field conditions, areexpected to come from a pulsar orbiting a black hole. in this sense, a pulsarin a close orbit ($p_{\rm orb}$ &lt; 1 yr) around our nearest supermassive blackhole candidate, sagittarius a* - at a distance of ~8.3 kpc in the galacticcentre (gillessen et al. 2009a) - would be the ideal tool. given the size ofthe orbit and the relativistic effects associated with it, even a slowlyspinning pulsar would allow the black hole spacetime to be explored in greatdetail (liu et al. 2012). for example, measurement of the frame dragging causedby the rotation of the supermassive black hole, would allow a test of the"cosmic censorship conjecture." the "no-hair theorem" can be tested bymeasuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole. these are two of the primeexamples for the fundamental studies of gravity one could do with a pulsararound sagittarius a*. as will be shown here, ska1-mid and ultimately the skawill provide the opportunity to begin to find and time the pulsars in thisextreme environment.

1501.00753	supergiant pulses from extragalactic neutron stars	we consider radio bursts that originate from extragalactic neutron stars(nss) by addressing three questions about source distances. what are thephysical limitations on coherent radiation at ghz frequencies? do they permitdetection at cosmological distances? how many bursts per ns are needed toproduce the inferred burst rate $\sim 10^3$-$10^4 $sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$? theburst rate is comparable to the ns formation rate in a hubble volume, requiringonly one per ns if they are bright enough. however, radiation physics causes usto favor a closer population. more bursts per ns are then required but repeatsin 10 to 100 yr could still be negligible. bursts are modeled as sub-ns,coherent shot pulses superposed incoherently to produce ms-duration $\sim 1$ jyamplitudes; each shot-pulse can be much weaker than the burst amplitude,placing less restrictive requirements on the emission process. nonetheless,single shot pulses are similar to the extreme, unresolved ($&lt; 0.4$ ns) mjy shotpulse seen from the crab pulsar, which is consistent with coherent curvatureradiation emitted near the light cylinder by an almost neutral clump with netcharge $\sim \pm 10^{21}e$ and total energy $\gtrsim 10^{23}$ ergs. bursts fromgpc distances require incoherent superposition of $\sim 10^{12}d_{\rm gpc}^2$shot pulses or a total energy $\gtrsim 10^{35} d_{\rm gpc}^2$ erg. the energyreservoir near the light cylinder limits the detection distance to $\lesssim{\rm few} \times 100$ mpc for a fluence $\sim 1$ jy ms unless conditions aremore extreme than for the crab pulsar. similarly, extreme single pulses fromordinary pulsars and magnetars could be detectable from throughout the localgroup and perhaps farther. contributions to dispersion measures from galaxyclusters will be significant for some of the bursts. we discuss tests for thesignatures of bursts associated with extragalactic nss.

1503.08491	frequency-dependent dispersion measures and implications for pulsar  timing	we analyze the frequency dependence of the dispersion measure (dm), thecolumn density of free electrons to a pulsar, caused by multipath scatteringfrom small scale electron-density fluctuations. the dm is slightly differentalong each propagation path and the transverse spread of paths varies greatlywith frequency, yielding time-of-arrival (toa) perturbations that scaledifferently than the inverse square of the frequency, the expected dependencefor a cold, unmagnetized plasma. we quantify dm and toa perturbationsanalytically for thin phase screens and extended media and verify the resultswith simulations of thin screens. the rms difference between dms across anoctave band near 1.5~ghz $\sim 4\times10^{-5}\,{\rm pc\ cm^{-3}}$ for pulsarsat $\sim 1$~kpc distance. toa errors from chromatic dms are of order a few tohundreds of nanoseconds for pulsars with dm $\lesssim 30$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ observedacross an octave band but increase rapidly to microseconds or larger for largerdms and wider frequency ranges. frequency-dependent dms introduce correlatednoise into timing residuals whose power spectrum is `low pass' in form. thecorrelation time is of order the geometric mean of the refraction times for thehighest and lowest radio frequencies used and thus ranges from days to years,depending on the pulsar. we discuss the implications for methodologies that uselarge frequency separations or wide bandwidth receivers for timingmeasurements. chromatic dms are partially mitigable by using an additionalchromatic term in arrival time models. without mitigation, our results providean additional term in the noise model for pulsar timing; they also indicatethat in combination with measurement errors from radiometer noise, an arbitraryincrease in total frequency range (or bandwidth) will yield diminishingbenefits and may be detrimental to overall timing precision.

1512.08326	the nanograv nine-year data set: noise budget for pulsar arrival times  on intraday timescales	the use of pulsars as astrophysical clocks for gravitational wave experimentsdemands the highest possible timing precision. pulse times of arrival (toas)are limited by stochastic processes that occur in the pulsar itself, along theline of sight through the interstellar medium, and in the measurement process.on timescales of seconds to hours, the toa variance exceeds that fromtemplate-fitting errors due to additive noise. we assess contributions to thetotal variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase jitterintrinsic to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse responsefrom scattering. the three effects have different dependencies on time,frequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. we use data on 37 pulsars from thenorth american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves to assess theindividual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.we detect jitter in 22 pulsars and estimate the average value of rms jitter inour pulsars to be $\sim 1\%$ of pulse phase. we examine how jitter evolves as afunction of frequency and find evidence for evolution. finally, we compare ourmeasurements with previous noise parameter estimates and discuss methods toimprove gravitational wave detection pipelines.

(2)variation with frequency of angular broadening that is much weaker than thetrademark \nu^{-2} scaling law (for a cold, unmagnetized plasma), includingfrequency-independent cases; and (3) similar departure of the pulse broadeningtime from the usually expected \nu^{-4} scaling law. we briefly discussapplications that include scattering of pulses from the crab pulsar byfilaments in the crab nebula; image asymmetries from galactic scattering of thesources cyg x-3, sgr a*, and ngc 6334b; and scattering of background activegalactic nuclei by intervening galaxies. we also address the consequences forinferences about the shape of the wavenumber spectrum of electron densityirregularities, which depend on scaling laws for the image size and the pulsebroadening. future low-frequency (&lt; 100 mhz) array observations will also bestrongly affected by the galactic structure of scattering material. ourformalism is derived in the context of radio scattering by plasma densityfluctuations. it is also applicable to optical, uv and x-ray scattering bygrains in the interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0106159	the velocity distribution of isolated radio pulsars	(abridged) we infer the velocity distribution of radio pulsars by modellingtheir birth, evolution, and detection in large-scale 0.4 ghz pulsar surveys,and by comparing model distributions of measurable pulsar properties withsurvey data using a likelihood function. we test models that characterize apopulation's birth rate, luminosity, shutoff of radio emission, birthlocations, and birth velocities. we infer that the radio beam luminosity (i) iscomparable to the energy flux of relativistic particles in models forspin-driven magnetospheres, signifying that radio emission losses reach nearly100% for the oldest pulsars; and (ii) scales approximately as sqrt(edot) which,in magnetosphere models, is proportional to the voltage drop available foracceleration of particles. we find that a two-component velocity distributionwith characteristic velocities of 90 km/s and 500 km/s is greatly preferred toany one-component distribution. we explore some consequences of the preferredbirth velocity distribution: (i) roughly 50% of pulsars in the solarneighborhood will escape the galaxy, while ~15% have velocities greater than1000 km/s; (ii) an important low-velocity population exists that increases thefraction of neutron stars retained by globular clusters and is consistent withthe number of old objects that accrete from the interstellar medium; (iii)under standard assumptions for supernova remnant expansion and pulsarspin-down, ~10% of pulsars younger than 20 kyr will appear to lie outside oftheir host remnants. finally, we comment on the ramifications of our birthvelocity distribution for binary survival and the population of inspiralingbinary neutron stars relevant to some grb models and potential sources forligo.

astro-ph;0201062	bow shocks from neutron stars: scaling laws and hst observations of the  guitar nebula	the interaction of high-velocity neutron stars with the interstellar mediumproduces bow shock nebulae, where the relativistic neutron star wind isconfined by ram pressure. we present multi-wavelength observations of theguitar nebula, including narrow-band h-alpha imaging with hst/wfpc2, whichresolves the head of the bow shock. the hst observations are used to fit forthe inclination of the pulsar velocity vector to the line of sight, and todetermine the combination of spindown energy loss, velocity, and ambientdensity that sets the scale of the bow shock. we find that the velocity vectoris most likely in the plane of the sky. we use the guitar nebula and otherobserved neutron star bow shocks to test scaling laws for their size andh-alpha emission, discuss their prevalence, and present criteria for theirdetectability in targeted searches. the set of h-alpha bow shocks showsremarkable consistency, in spite of the expected variation in ambient densitiesand orientations. together, they support the assumption that a pulsar'sspindown energy losses are carried away by a relativistic wind that isindistinguishable from being isotropic. comparison of h-alpha bow shocks withx-ray and nonthermal, radio-synchrotron bow shocks produced by neutron starsindicates that the overall shape and scaling is consistent with the samephysics. it also appears that nonthermal radio emission and h-alpha emissionare mutually exclusive in the known objects and perhaps in all objects.

astro-ph;0207451	a clean-based method for deconvolving interstellar pulse broadening from  radio pulses	multipath propagation in the interstellar medium distorts radio pulses, aneffect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. typically,broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-inducedpulse broadening, but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulseshapes. in this paper we develop and apply a method that recovers both theintrinsic pulse shape and the pulse broadening function that describes thescattering of an impulse. the method resembles the clean algorithm used insynthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulsebroadening function, and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsicpulse structre. as figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use thepositivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean squareresidual and the number of points below a given threshold. our method makes noprior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a rangeof scattering functions for the interstellar medium. it can therefore beapplied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scatteringthan the previous approaches. we apply the technique to both simulated data anddata from arecibo observations.

astro-ph;0304495	the brightest pulses in the universe: multifrequency observations of the  crab pulsar's giant pulses	we analyze the crab pulsar at ten frequencies from 0.43 to 8.8 ghz using dataobtained at the arecibo observatory. giant pulses occur only in the main andinterpulse components manifest from radio frequencies to gamma-ray energies.individual giant pulses reach brightness temperatures of at least $10^{32}$k inour data, which do not resolve the narrowest pulses, and are known to reach$10^{37}$k in nanosecond-resolution observations (hankins et al 2003). giantpulses are therefore the brightest known in the observable universe andrepresent an important milestone for theories of the pulsar emission mechanismto explain. their short durations allow them to serve as especially sensitiveprobes of the crab nebula and the interstellar medium. we analyze frequencystructure in individual giant pulses using a scintillating,amplitude-modulated,polarized shot-noise model. the frequency structureassociated with multipath propagation decorrelates on a time scale of 25 sec at1.5 ghz, which requires that multipath propagation be strongly influenced bymaterial within the crab nebula. additional frequency structure decorrelatesfaster than one spin period, as would be expected from the shot-noise patternof nanosecond duration pulses emitted by the pulsar. taking into account thecrab pulsar's locality inside a bright supernova remnant, we conclude that thebrightest pulse in a typical 1-hour observation would be most easily detectablein our lowest frequency band (0.43 ghz) to a distance of 1.6 mpc. we alsodiscuss the detection of such pulses using future instruments such as lofar andthe ska.

astro-ph;0310073	arecibo 430 mhz pulsar polarimetry: faraday rotation measures and  morphological classifications	we have measured faraday rotation measures (rms) at arecibo observatory for36 pulsars, 17 of them new. we combine these and earlier measurements to studythe galactic magnetic field and its possible temporal variations. many rmvalues have changed significantly on several-year timescales, but thesevariations probably do not reflect interstellar magnetic field changes. bystudying the distribution of pulsar rms near the plane in conjunction with thenew ne2001 electron density model, we note the following structures in thefirst galactic longitude quadrant: (1) the local field reversal can be tracedas a null in rm in a 0.5-kpc wide strip interior to the solar circle, extending\~7 kpc around the galaxy. (2) steadily increasing rms in a 1-kpc wide stripinterior to the local field reversal, and also in the wedge bounded by 42&lt;l&lt;52deg, indicate that the large-scale field is approximately steady from the localreversal in to the sagittarius arm. (3) the rms in the 1-kpc wide stripinterior to the sagittarius arm indicate another field reversal in this strip.(4) the rms in a final 1-kpc wide interior strip, straddling the scutum arm,also support a second field reversal interior to the sun,between thesagittarius and scutum arms. (5) exterior to the nearby reversal, rms from60&lt;l&lt;78 deg show evidence for two reversals, on the near and far side of theperseus arm. (6) in general, the maxima in the large-scale fields tend to liealong the spiral arms, while the field minima tend to be found between them. wehave also determined polarized profiles of 48 pulsars at 430 mhz. we presentmorphological pulse profile classifications of the pulsars, based on our newmeasurements and previously published data.

astro-ph;0311340	smashing the guitar: an evolving neutron star bow shock	the guitar nebula is a spectacular example of an h-alpha bow shock nebulaproduced by the interaction of a neutron star with its environment. the radiopulsar b2224+65 is traveling at ~800--1600 km/s (for a distance of 1--2 kpc),placing it on the high-velocity tail of the pulsar velocity distribution. herewe report time evolution in the shape of the guitar nebula, the first suchobservations for a bow shock nebula, as seen in h-alpha imaging with the hubblespace telescope. the morphology of the nebula provides no evidence foranisotropy in the pulsar wind, nor for fluctuations in the pulsar windluminosity. the nebula shows morphological changes over two epochs spaced byseven years that imply the existence of significant gradients andinhomogeneities in the ambient interstellar medium. these observations offerastrophysically unique, in situ probes of length scales between 5e-4 pc and0.012 pc. model fitting suggests that the nebula axis -- and thus thethree-dimensional velocity vector -- lies within 20 degrees of the plane of thesky, and also jointly constrains the distance to the neutron star and theambient density.

astro-ph;0312044	pulsar parallaxes at 5 ghz with the very long baseline array	we present the first pulsar parallaxes measured with phase-referenced pulsarvlbi observations at 5 ghz. due to the steep spectra of pulsars, previousastrometric measurements have been at lower frequencies. however, the strongestpulsars can be observed at 5 ghz, offering the benefit of lower combinedionospheric and tropospheric phase errors, which usually limit vlbi astrometricaccuracy. the pulsars b0329+54, b0355+54 and b1929+10 were observed for 7epochs spread evenly over 2 years. for b0329+54, large systematic errors leadto only an upper limit on the parallax (pi &lt; 1.5 mas). a new proper motion andparallax were measured for b0355+54 (pi = 0.91 +- 0.16 mas), implying adistance of 1.04+0.21-0.16 kpc and a transverse velocity of 61+12-9 km/s. theparallax and proper motion for b1929+10 were significantly improved (pi = 2.77+- 0.07 mas), yielding a distance of 361+10-8 pc and a transverse velocity of177+4-5 km/s. we demonstrate that the astrometric errors are correlated withthe angular separation between the phase reference calibrator and the targetsource, with significantly lower errors at 5 ghz compared to 1.6 ghz. finally,based on our new distance determinations for b1929+10 and b0355+54, we deriveor constrain the luminosities of each pulsar at high energies. we show that,for thermal emission models, the emitting area for x-rays from psr b1929+10 isroughly consistent with the canonical size for a heated polar cap, and that theconversion of spin-down power to gamma-ray luminosity in b0355+54 must be low.the new proper motion for b1929+10 also implies that its progenitor is unlikelyto have been the binary companion of the runaway o-star zeta-ophiuchi.

astro-ph;0605145	rocking the lighthouse: circumpulsar asteroids and radio intermittency	we propose that neutral, circumpulsar debris entering the light cylinder canaccount for many time-dependent pulsar phenomena that are otherwise difficultto explain. neutral material avoids propeller ejection and injects sufficientcharges -- after heating, evaporation, and ionization -- to alter current flowsand pair-production and thus trigger, detune, or extinguish coherent emission.relevant phenomena, with time scales from seconds to months, include nulls,rotating radio transients (rrats), rapid changes in pulse profile (``modechanges''), variable subpulse drift rates, quasi-periodic bursts from b1931+24,and torque variations. over the 10 myr lifetime of a canonical pulsar withtrillion-gauss surface magnetic field, less than a millionth of an earth massof material is needed to modulate the goldreich-julian current by 100%.circumpulsar material originates from metal-rich, supernova fallback gas thataggregates into asteroids. debris disks can inject sufficient material on timescales of interest, yet be too tenuous to form large planets detectable inpulse timing data. asteroid migration results from collisions and theradiation-driven yarkovsky and poynting-robertson effects. for b1931+24, anasteroid in a $\sim 40$~day elliptical orbit pollutes the magnetospherestochastically through collisions with other debris. injection is less likelyfor hot, young and highly magnetized pulsars or millisecond pulsars thatpre-ionize any debris material well outside their small magnetospheres.injection effects will therefore be most prominent in long-period, coolerpulsars, consistent with the distribution of relevant objects in perid andperiod derivative. a pulsar's spin history and its radiation-beam orientationmay influence whether it displays nulling, rrats and other effects.

astro-ph;9912410	a vla search for the geminga pulsar: a bayesian limit on a scintillating  source	we derive an upper limit of 3 mjy (95% confidence) for the flux density at317 mhz of the geminga pulsar (j0633+1746). our results are based on 7 hours offast-sampled vla data, which we averaged synchronously with the pulse periodusing a period model based on cgro/egret gamma-ray data. our limit accounts forthe fact that this pulsar is most likely subject to interstellar scintillationson a timescale much shorter than our observing span. our bayesian method isquite general and can be applied to calculate the fluxes of other scintillatedsources. we also present a bayesian technique for calculating the flux in apulsed signal of unknown width and phase.  comparing our upper limit of 3 mjy with the quoted flux density of geminga at102 mhz, we calculate a lower limit to its spectral index of 2.7. we discusssome possible reasons for geminga's weakness at radio wavelengths, and thelikelihood that many of the unidentified egret sources are also radio-quiet orradio-weak geminga-like pulsars.
