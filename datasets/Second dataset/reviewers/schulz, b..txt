0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1011.4079	search for gravitational wave bursts from six magnetars	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) are thought tobe magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. these rareobjects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-raybursts. the burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation ofnon-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (gws). we present theresults of a search for gw bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitiveto neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient gw emittingoscillatory modes in compact stars. one of them, sgr 0501+4516, is likely ~1kpc from earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted inprevious gw searches. a second, axp 1e 1547.0-5408, gave a burst with anestimated isotropic energy &gt;10^{44} erg which is comparable to the giantflares. we find no evidence of gws associated with a sample of 1279electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between november 2006 andjune 2009, in gw data from the ligo, virgo, and geo600 detectors. our lowestmodel-dependent gw emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limitedwhite noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f-mode ringdowns (at1090 hz), are 3.0x10^{44} d_1^2 erg and 1.4x10^{47} d_1^2 erg respectively,where d_1 = d_{0501} / 1 kpc and d_{0501} is the distance to sgr 0501+4516.these limits on gw emission from f-modes are an order of magnitude lower thanany previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in sgrgiant flares for the first time.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1301.7318	a herschel survey of the [n ii] 205 micron line in local luminous  infrared galaxies --- the [n ii] 205 micron emission as a star formation rate  indicator	we present, for the first time, a statistical study of [n ii] 205 mciron lineemission for a large sample of local luminous infrared galaxies using herschelspectral and photometric imaging receiver fourier transform spectrometer (spirefts) data. for our sample of galaxies, we investigate the correlation betweenthe [n ii] luminosity (lnii) and the total infrared luminosity (lir), as wellas the dependence of lnii/lir ratio on lir, far infrared colors (iras$f_{60}/f_{100}$) and the [o iii] 88 micron to [n ii] luminosity ratio. we findthat lnii correlates almost linearly with lir for non agn galaxies (all having$l_{ir} &lt; 10^{12} l_solar$) in our sample, which implies that lnii can serve asa sfr tracer which is particularly useful for high redshift galaxies which willbe observed with forthcoming submm spectroscopic facilities such as the atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array. our analysis shows that the deviationfrom the mean lnii-lir relation correlates with tracers of the ionizationparameter, which suggests the scatter in this relation is mainly due to thevariations in the hardness, and/or ionization parameter, of the ambientgalactic uv field among the sources in our sample.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1303.6725	hermes: a deficit in the surface brightness of the cosmic infrared  background due to galaxy cluster gravitational lensing	we have observed four massive galaxy clusters with the spire instrument onthe herschel space observatory and measure a deficit of surface brightnesswithin their central region after subtracting sources. we simulate the effectsof instrumental sensitivity and resolution, the source population, and thelensing effect of the clusters to estimate the shape and amplitude of thedeficit. the amplitude of the central deficit is a strong function of thesurface density and flux distribution of the background sources. we find thatfor the current best fitting faint end number counts, and excellent lensingmodels, the most likely amplitude of the central deficit is the full intensityof the cosmic infrared background (cib). our measurement leads to a lower limitto the integrated total intensity of the cib of i(250 microns) &gt;0.69_(-0.03)^(+0.03) (stat.)_(-0.06)^(+0.11) (sys.) mjy/sr, with more cibpossible from both low-redshift sources and from sources within the targetclusters. it should be possible to observe this effect in existing high angularresolution data at other wavelengths where the cib is bright, which would allowtests of models of the faint source component of the cib.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1403.1107	calibration of the herschel spire fourier transform spectrometer	the herschel spire instrument consists of an imaging photometric camera andan imaging fourier transform spectrometer (fts), both operating over afrequency range of 450-1550 ghz. in this paper, we briefly review the ftsdesign, operation, and data reduction, and describe in detail the approachtaken to relative calibration (removal of instrument signatures) and absolutecalibration against standard astronomical sources. the calibration schemeassumes a spatially extended source and uses the herschel telescope as primarycalibrator. conversion from extended to point-source calibration is carried outusing observations of the planet uranus. the model of the telescope emission isshown to be accurate to within 6% and repeatable to better than 0.06% and, bycomparison with models of mars and neptune, the uranus model is shown to beaccurate to within 3%. multiple observations of a number of point-like sourcesshow that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1%, if theeffects of the satellite absolute pointing error (ape) are corrected. thesatellite ape leads to a decrement in the derived flux, which can be up to ~10%(1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the spire range in the first part of themission, and ~4% after herschel operational day 1011. the lower frequency rangeof the spire band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beamsize. overall, for well-pointed, point-like sources, the absolute fluxcalibration is better than 6%, and for extended sources where mapping isrequired it is better than 7%.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

(1998) we have obtained acceptable and wellconstrained fits to the observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of 41 ofthese sources, for which additional optical/near-infrared magnitudes, and, insome cases, redshifts, were available. we have then determined the totalinfrared luminosities and star formation rates (sfrs) of these 41 sources, ofwhich 27 are cluster members and 14 are field galaxies at a median redshiftz~0.6.  the seds of most of the isocam cluster members are best fit by models withnegligible star formation in the last ~1 gyr. the 7 faintest cluster membershave a slightly higher, but still very mild, star-formation activity. theisocam-selected cluster galaxies appear to be an unbiased subsample of theoverall cluster population. if a2218 is undergoing a merger, as suggested bysome optical and x-ray analyses, then this merger does not seem to affect themid-infrared properties of its galaxies.  the seds of most isocam-selected field sources are best fit by models withsignificant ongoing (and recent) star formation, resembling those of massivestar-forming spirals or (post)starburst galaxies. their median sfr is 22 solarmasses per year. eight of the 14 field sources are luminous ir galaxies.(abridged)

astro-ph;9810480	an ultra-deep isocam observation through a cluster-lens	we present results of ultra-deep isocam observations through a cluster-lensat 7 and 15 micron with the infrared space observatory (iso) satellite. theseobservations reveal a large number of luminous mid-infrared (mir) sources.cross-identification in the optical and near-infrared (nir) wavebands showsthat about half of the 7 micron sources are cluster galaxies. the other 7micron and almost all 15 micron sources are identified as lensed distantgalaxies. thanks to the gravitational amplification they constitute thefaintest mir detected sources, allowing us to extend the number counts in boththe 7 and 15 micron bands. in particular, we find that the 15 micron countshave a steep slope alpha_15 = -1.5 +/- 0.3 and are large, with n_15 (&gt;30microjy}) = 13 +/- 5 per square arcmin. these numbers rule out non-evolutionarymodels and favour very strong evolution. down to our counts limit, we foundthat the resolved 7 and 15 microns background radiation intensity isrespectively (2 +/-0.5) 10^(-9) and (5 +/-1) 10^(-9) w m^(-2) sr^(-1).

astro-ph;9901147	a deep and ultra-deep isocam cosmological survey through gravitationally  lensing clusters of galaxies	we present imaging results and source counts from an isocam deep andultra-deep cosmological survey through gravitationally lensing clusters ofgalaxies at 7 and 15 microns. a total area of about 53 sq.arcmin was covered inmaps of three clusters. the lensing increases the sensitivity of the survey. alarge number of luminous mid-infrared (mir) sources were detected behind thelenses, and most could be unambiguously identified with visible counterparts.thanks to the gravitational amplification, these results include the faintestmir detections ever recorded, extending source counts to an unprecedentedlevel. the source counts, corrected for cluster contamination and lensingdistortion effects, show an excess by a factor of 10 with respect to theprediction of a no-evolution model, as we reported for a2390 alone in altieriet al. (1999). these results support the a2390 result that the resolved 7 and15 microns background radiation intensities are 1.7 (+/- 0.5) x 10^-9 and 3.3(+/- 1.3) x 10^-9 w/m^2/sr, respectively, integrating from 30 microjy to 50mjy.
